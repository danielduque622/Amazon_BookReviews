1,"I bought this book with the sincere attempt to get an understanding of why anyone would advocate for Socialism.  What I got was the description of a problem, followed by a bunch of history, followed by playbook for launching a socialist agenda.  Lacking was any connection of how socialism would in fact solve the problems noted at the start of the book.So what are the problems this author sees?  That we live in a system which exploits working people resulting in a class of the well to do being unfairly better off while everyone else are grinding thru life paycheck to paycheck with little or no protection from calamity.  The author then states (with no proof) that if we only lived under socialism things would be fair and more people would be better off.We then go into 6 chapters recounting historical movements and time periods in which various forms of socialism are partially or fully implemented.  The author does give a decent retelling.  He points out both the good and bad.  Yet in these chapters I found many nuances and bias which undermined his attempt to convince me to look at socialism as a potential answer.  There are many references to how a capitalist system did in fact produce greater output than could otherwise been achieved at that time.  Which is some ways undermines the need to look at socialism as an answer.Here are some examples of bias.  He notes that Britain outproduced other nations in the production of coal and could therefore build and need workers for, manufacturing facilities (page 38).  He then notes ""Fortunately"" for the capitalists the agricultural boom left many in poverty which then forced them to move to cities to work in the factories.  Why is this ""fortunate""?  Perhaps it was fortunate the population now had jobs in a different field.He refers to the Bolshevik revolution as ""noble"" (page 81).  While the White movement in Russia is ""unholy"" (page97).  The head of the Bolshevik secret police - Felix Dzershinsky - is called a ""hardened"" man who after quick interrogations would have people shot.  Yet the White movement is called a ""terror"" that ""murdered"" people (page 97).  Then this gem on page 98 - ""during the civil war the Bolsheviks blurred the lines between actions taken out of necessity and those performed out of virtue"".Noted in a previous review is the authors ultimate example of bias.  ""Yet if we can only look away from the human toll, if only for a moment, we can see that the Five year plan was a success...the soviet union made incredible advances...state planning led to a rapid rise in GDP"".  A few lines later the author notes that a new deadly political terror and campaign of mass murder began.  Stalin...transformed the soviet union...into a horrific totalitarian regime (page 102).  Gee what a trade off.  Just close your eyes and don't notice the millions killed and we can celebrate a growth in GDP?  It's like saying that if we could just ignore all those Nazi atrocities and see past the bad stuff we can give them kudos for their nice highways and full employment.I could fill in more examples but you get the drift - if a socialist does something bad he gets the benefit of the doubt while if a capitalist does it then it is evil.There are then numerous examples of admission how capitalism actually produces higher abundance and output.  Almost every chapter in the history section notes some example of the growth and higher output produced by a capitalistic system.  In fact on page 131 the author notes Marx understood that a socialist revolution would only come about if capitalism produced enough abundance to create class system from which those on the bottom could be stirred up to bring socialism to life.I did learn some new insights such as all the failed attempts of so called ""socialists"" in the third world to bring about real change (pages 153-156) - Afghanistan/Fail, Angola/Fail, Mozambique/Fail, Vietnam/Fail, Zimbabwe/Fail, Tanzania/Fail, Cuba/Fail.  Apparently these countries do not have well developed economies so as to make socialism work.Then there are some rather dubious stretches of logic and connecting of the dots.  On page 198 he somehow makes the connection that the shooting of Michael Brown in St Louis in 2014 is a ""failure of American democracy"".  Could it possibly have been poor police practices?  Or the victim attempting to take the officers weapon?  How on earth is this the failure of democracy?  Then on page 240 - as if on cue - a comment about how capitalism has created the climate crisis and could destroy civilization as we know it.  Stated as a absolute fact with no support.  No mention of the massive amount of pollution created by the coal burning of Communist China.So finally - we get to the last couple of chapters - how socialists take over - ie the gameplan.1 -  socialists must create class division by constantly bringing attention to ""unjust"" outcome of capitalism to fuel peoples anger at the system2 - ""street"" protests and strikes can be used to ""discipline"" wayward political candidates who do not go along with a redistribution agenda3 - socialists are reliant on continued profits from private companies to pay for their agenda - so try to win reforms such as Medicare for all, free child care, etc using profits from private companies4 - socialists must gain decisive majorities in legislatures - then be willing to ""flex our social muscle"" via mass protests and strikes and choose confrontation over accommodation5 - Elite ideological Socialists can best perceive class relations and must not compromise and instead opt for disruptive roles in politics6 - An elite college education is important to train a large group of effective speakers, writers and sharp thinkers7 - Socialists should focus on taking jobs in emerging sectors of our economy such as education, healthcare, supply and logistics - create unions - create support for strikes8- socialists need to create a new mass membership party with organized delegates putting up candidates in all elections at all levels9 - abolish the electoral college and change our constitution to be a unicameral legislature with proportional representationSo after all that there is no real answer for WHY socialism would create a better society.  No discussion of HOW it would work in real life.  No empirical evidence that it would solve any of our problems.  No discussion of changing the tax code, breaking up big banks, additional regulations or any other solution.The author simply keeps repeating that socialists want the people to have more say.  That the system isn't fair.  That the socialist want things like free child care, free college, free healthcare.  That socialists don't discriminate and what want equal rights for women and minorities.  He just doesn't make a coherent case that socialism is the answer to these problems.I really did read this book with an open mind and wanted something to bite on for my own understanding but found this book lacking.",2,0,6978,0.113,1
2,"The reading experience probably deserves 4 stars, but I cruelly deducted one because the book could have used a little more flesh on them bones.  It's a fine read, but it doesn't quite know what it wants to be.  Brooks self-consciously describes it as more of a pamphlet, which probably would have worked if it was a more general analysis, or a cohesive articulation of a strategy or philosophy.  What it mostly consists of is very specific, singled-out critiques of what Brooks sees as the biggest weaknesses of Harris, Peterson, and Shapiro.  These can mostly be boiled down to ""Harris' so-called 'thought experiments' are disingenuous attempts to camouflage his biases,"" ""Peterson's defenses of hierarchy are self-serving and too generalizable, and the political waters he likes to swim in are far beyond his expertise,"" and ""Ben Shapiro is a shitposter.""  All of this is true enough; they're flawed individuals who've attracted a large and far-too ingenuous following.The problem is that Brooks' overall thesis is that the left needs to look hard at what voids the ""IDW"" filled in people that caused it to be such a flash in the pan, and speak to those same needs with honesty and sophistication in order to avoid marginalizing people who could probably be convinced of the error of their ways.  I completely agree.  I just don't think the book really has an audience outside of people who already watch his show.  It seems to me that left-leaning people outside of the extremely online variety who spend a lot of time listening to podcasts will mostly be disinterested in such a narrowly delineated criticism of three individuals and be unclear on how it connects to the central point of the book.  Right-leaning or ""centrist"" (cough) hyperonline people will be irritated that these folks that they've spent hundreds of hours digesting are being reduced to their weakest or most embarrassing moments, and good-faith actors among them who might be willing to admit that these are areas where the people they admire goofed up will be put off by the impression that such a targeted critique is an effort to smuggle in a political stance that they're predisposed to reject.In Brooks' defense, he seems to be aware of this.  He wisely avoids spending much time dunking on the noted dope Dave Rubin (his restraint is so palpable it's hilarious).  Still, the flavor of the book obviously comes from someone whose public-facing work mostly consists of quick political reactions and hot takes.  Those instincts come through pretty clearly when his only real thing to say about the Weinstein brothers is to write them off as ""bland"" and move on.  He gives them another nod when he briefly mentions the ruckus at Evergreen College as an embarrassing moment of leftist overreaction that unfortunately made the Weinsteins famous.  One suspects that doing a more serious critique of them didn't appeal to Brooks' hunger for red meat, and I think that's a wasted opportunity.To lay my cards on the table, I'm left-leaning but probably someone Michael Brooks would consider to be more neoliberal or 'enlightened-centrist' than he'd respect (which is fine.)  I actually get a lot out of Jordan Peterson, even if I agree that his politics are embarrassingly half-informed for how seriously he takes them.  But I'm glad he exists, and I admit that I suspect that he's been more useful in pulling people back from modern nascent Nazism than most commentators on the left.  I think he's flawed, but honest.  Basically he's a consequentialist who's glad to admit when the left is on the correct side of an argument, but fears the unintentional fallout of overreaching upheavals.  You can disagree, but at least it's defensible.  Harris is very much up his own ass, but the fact that this left-leaning atheist is talked about as a ""gateway to the alt-right"" is an outright indictment of how much the leftist habit of presenting a totalizing, faux-sterilized, and tongue-cluckingly moralistic worldview is utter poison in terms of convincing people that they're doing something wrong and need to change.  Brooks' focus on the ""Vampire Castle"" shows that, I think, he would agree with that.  The left can't chase people away.  But his dripping disdain for Harris is obvious, when frankly, I think that Harris and people like him *can be saved.*  He, Peterson, and many people like them are, in my opinion, unconscious of a lot of their own foibles, prone to defensiveness, and all the rest.  But like anyone who considers themselves a good-faith actor, they're reachable as long as they feel like their ego/selfhood isn't the thing being pulled onto the butcher's block.  Keep in mind, Harris is someone who likes Sanders and views Trump with horror.  Both of the Weinstein brothers are Sanders supporters.  Peterson, for all his ""classical liberalism,"" I haven't heard say anything critical of Canadian healthcare or a social safety net -- he's just operating in a bubble.  These people are practical, and reachable.  A dialogue can be had.  Slowly and painfully, but that's the price.  The irony of the Against the Web is that it treats them like enemies while warning against the chilling effect of doing that very thing.All that said, I like Michael Brooks, and I want to hear more from him.  I think he's right to treat Shapiro like a hack and a bad-faith actor, and the less said about Rubin the better.  Brooks' indictment of the IDW as dishonest because it treats Rubin with friendly respect rings very true, and it speaks to a human fear of circling the wagons and firing inward.  But it's true, regardless.  I hope that the author continues to move across the bridge from joking online provocateur, because he's clearly a very bright and funny guy who, I think, has all the right intentions.  Like the best of the people he opposes, he's flawed like anyone, and his itch to prick is understandable and probably a force for good, in the end.  I'd like Against the Web to be him clearing his throat for something more full-bodied in the future.",3,0,6032,0.153,1
3,"Seraphina Arden is well-known for her scandalous views on equality, her penchant for taking lovers, and her propensity for wine-drinking.  She hopes to open an institute to train women to work in trades usually reserved for men.  To raise funds, she’s decided to publish her memoirs exposing her sordid past and the powerful man who set her on the road to ruin.  She’s singular in her purpose, holding her friends as family and ensuring her lovers are gone by morning.Adam Anderson is a widowed Scottish architect spending the summer working on a project in Cornwall.  He has two children and a burgeoning business to protect.  He can’t afford an affair and certainly not with scandalous Seraphina Arden.  But she’s spending the summer in her native Cornwall as well and her proposal of a no strings attached month between them proves too tempting when Adam has been burying his passionate nature and grief for the past three years.A simple fling rapidly grows far more complicated and emotional, igniting feelings neither expected to experience again.  But when Sera learns that Adam’s career is staked on the good favor of the man she’s on the cusp of calling out in her memoirs, she must decide between her cause and her heart.I have so many feelings and thoughts about this book, so you may be in for a bit of a ramble.  I was so looking forward to it but I must say it was both what I expected and a bit of a disappointment.  There can be no doubt that this book is impeccably well-written, if a bit wordy in places, but in my opinion at least, it isn’t really a romance at all.  This is more of a feminist treatise that I would expect to read in a literature class or discuss in a serious-minded book club and it certainly did its job in that respect.  It put me into the frame of mind of the true feminists who lived in what was a terrifying time for women in which we had virtually no rights at all and illuminated the contrast between the true meaning and purpose of feminism and today’s watered down, easily offended version.  But it was not a romance.Sera’s relationship with Adam took a backseat to literally everything else in the book and Adam was never given much opportunity for growth or depth.  He was one of the sweetest and most thoughtful heroes I’ve read and as such I wound up thinking that he deserved better and more than he wound up getting from Sera.  I wanted him to have more of a backbone and stop coming back for more each time Sera continued to treat him horribly.  This was definitely Sera’s story with Adam just thrown in for spice.  There wasn’t much substance to their story as a couple and not much was ever really developed, though I don’t think their relationship was really so much the point here.  Honestly for all her strong principles and arguments, which I agreed with, Sera herself just struck me, at least most of the time, as immature and emotionally stunted, drowning her feelings in alcohol, throwing childish tantrums, and exhibiting what was, at its core, a selfish nature.  Much of the time I felt she was just using Adam and based on the whims of her unstable emotions with no care to how she might affect him.  At one point she even tried to force herself on Adam, which to me is rather unforgiveable; it certainly would be so if the roles had been reversed, and that made my respect for her ebb even more.  She acted as if she and other ruined women were the only ones to have ever suffered in life and that was grossly irritating to me.  By the time she started to consider his feelings even a bit, it was a little too late for me, especially given the fact that she still tried to keep things from him.There was a ridiculous amount of back and forth between these two that got slightly after a while.  The first past of the book especially was very slow paced and that pacing was really increased by large infusions of angst, which always annoys me, though I will say it was very well done here and felt very real and raw (which is probably why it was so hard to read.)  Also, make no mistake, just because this wasn’t exactly a romance don’t think it wasn’t steamy; it was, very much so and not for those who prefer to remain on the sensual side.  That said, I wound up feeling like those steamy scenes didn’t further the relationship between Adam and Sera, with Sera ultimately keeping Adam at arm’s length or to some extent distant, even by the epilogue and that made the ending rather unsatisfying for me.I loved the idea of role reversing with a female rake, but the enjoyable part of reading a rake is that he reforms for that one special woman.  I don’t think Sera ever did this or even came close.  Even at the end she was still married to her cause which, while respectable, ultimately made her seem a bit self-focused to me, especially given her lack of consideration for the potential respectability of her child.  While Sera certainly exhibited some redeeming qualities, she never really became likable for me and still always expected much more from others than she was ever willing to give of herself.The main problem may be that this was a bit too grave and serious in tone for me right now.  Overall, this was a well-written book and given that it ended on somewhat of a cliffhanger for one of the supporting characters I’ll probably continue the series even though this one wasn’t quite for me.I voluntarily read and reviewed an advanced copy of this book.  All thoughts and opinions are my own.",3,0,5469,0.132,1
4,"This is a great book, featuring two very well-written teenagers as the main characters.  There are some good aspects and some bad.  I'll heap my praises and then tell you the bits I didn't like.I really enjoyed how the teenage girls are portrayed.  They're neither too childish, nor too grown up.  Both characters have facets of adulthood and childhood... as it should be.  And while there's plenty of friction, you don't have that obnoxiously overblown teenage angst that so much teen fiction uses as fuel for petty melodrama.  All of their conflicts have actual emotional weight.  I found them very believable and likable, which is pretty unusual for teenage characters.  Teenagers are so often so badly written, portrayed as so childish and stupid, that I've often found it hard to take seriously, or endure.  Not at all the case here!For that matter, everyone in the book is a very well balanced sort of character, nobody outside of the villains being too perfect, nor too flawed.  Their interpersonal relationships feel very familiar, and they hit close to home, even if they're not our own.The plot was enjoyable, too, a page-turner, if you'll forgive me a cliche.  I read it in just two days, and I'm usually someone who bounces around a few books.  This one held my attention continuously, and had me guessing and asking questions up until the end.  Much like one of the main characters, I was rooting for a certain outcome.  To avoid spoilers, all I can say is that I was very happy with the outcome that does happen.And finally, I want to express my admiration about the make-out scene.  That's not to say I found it titillating, but it takes a skilled writer to address teenage libidos.  Neither did the author hand-wave the scene away, nor did she hit the territory of erotica.  It felt very realistic, there were details, but didn't get gross.  When the scene first started, I flinched a little, because I was afraid it might get cringe-y, but it never did.  It was beautifully handled, so bravo.So, now the bad.  Keep in mind that these are somewhat minor things, even though I'm being very detailed about why I don't like them.First of all, the book is set in the WWII era, and while I know some people like that, I feel like it's about as done to death as zombies and vampires combined.  (I got this when I was just nabbing some random books from the sci-fi/ fantasy sections, deciding I'd read them, whatever I got.  I was in a bit of rut for what to read lately.)  Normally that alone would've caused me to give this book a pass.  There are so many wars in history, so many types of people, cultures, things that have happened.  Why does this one sliver of history get so much fiction put into it?  Pretty much everyone who survived WWII is dead now, none of us really need this for catharsis.  Do we really have to keep beating this dead horse?  Can people not pick another war, another place, another time, to get into the same issues?  I don't LIKE Nazis, nor racism, but making Nazis the villain feels pretty lazy.  You don't have to develop them, nobody questions if they're good or bad.  It's a stock, flat, low effort bad guy that you can have befall any fate, without it marring the main characters' morality.Another thing that was worth note, is that both the beginning and end are a little bit 'eh'.  The author, as my husband put it, ""Front-load[s] all of the exposition"".  Four characters, all the same gender, are basically all introduced at the same time, all of them have very expositional thoughts about the others, while having expositional dialogue about one another, AND simultaneously including a good deal of information about the way their magic works.  It almost made me toss the book, but I'm glad I slogged through the first bits.  The majority of it is very good.The epilogue on the other hand, feels really cheap.  I actually rolled my eyes, because the last chapter had a perfect, beautiful ending.  It was the kind of ending you want from a good novel.  But then the epilogue goes through some scenes, none of which you couldn't have inferred were going to happen, and pulls out a cheap sort-of cliffhanger.  It's a little insulting and completely unnecessary, given that one of the book's major flaws IS this attempt to rope me into the next one.  Have you ever been on a really good date, and before you even get home, the other person wants to know when the next date is?  You know how in that instance, you think to yourself ""We probably would've had a next date, but you just made it SO weird.""  The epilogue made it SO weird.  You can get away with pulling that on me for a TV show, where the next episode is, at best, a few months away.  But this is a book, and it's probably gonna be at least a year before the next one.  Not a cool tactic when you're going to have people on the line that long.  ...So if you're reading this prior to purchase, you can just SKIP THE EPILOGUE.  Seriously, rip the epilogue out of your book before you start and set it on fire.  Don't be tempted to have that weird date, but with a book.I don't want to go out on that note, so I'll say again, it's a very good book.  I'll probably read others in the series, but it's uh... gonna have to wait a week or two for me to call back.",4,0,5263,0.119,0
5,"This book has a lot of interesting things in it having to do with genetics and schizophrenia and possibly preventing schizophrenia with supplements while the fetus is still forming and growing.  I appreciate the fact that the author acknowledges that not all that much has changed in the treatment of mental illness since these boys were growing up in the 1950's and 1960's.  He is correct not much has changed at all.  But, I have a couple of problems with this book:  1) the author says the heart conditions caused by the drugs given to schizophrenics for years are ""rare"" but in the next paragraph says that tens of thousands of people die from these heart related issues.  I can tell you if tens of thousands are reported, it is likely far higher than that because people who are considered mentally ill aren't regarded highly enough for anyone to even record on a death certificate that the heart attack or heart failure was caused by taking these horrible medications year after year.  So it isn't rare at all.  At least with the medications the author acknowledges the danger and how sad it is.  But, 2) what I find UNFORGIVABLE and highly DISTURBING is the author just taking the propaganda being pushed out about electro shock treatments these days.  He calls it a ""kinder, gentler"" electro shock treatment.  The FDA outlawed the old electro shock machines and companies scrambled to make a new version.  The one currently used was pushed through the FDA as safer when, in fact, it kills and damages more brain cells than the old version.  The author then says that patients are under anesthesia (oh, how very kind) and that they are given muscle relaxants so they will be calm and have less anxiety.  Yes, I suppose it comes in handy to basically paralyze patients who are in institutions and don't want this treatment done to them and are fighting under their restraints.  They also give muscle relaxants so that when the body goes into violent convulsions, bones aren't broken, as they were in years past.  It isn't done to keep people calm and anxiety free.  This is a billion dollar industry.  Medicare is billed billions of dollars by doctors taking patients (mostly females) out of nursing homes and giving them electro shock treatments.  It is a fact that most patients given this torture still have to remain on medications, so what exactly is the accomplishment??  The author then throws in that a handful of celebrities (from years gone by) have even tried it out.  Well there is a far cry from a wealthy, well known person in control of their own body deciding  to have a treatment or two to see if it ""helps"" them and the VAST MAJORITY of poor souls who have this forced upon them, sometimes by court order, or vulnerable people being told by their psychiatrists about the ""good results"" they are seeing, and how the ""new ECT""  is safe, and having it done to them over and over and over.  Throwing this crap in about ""celebrities"" doing it is just another part of trying to normalize this atrocity.  The rebranding of this horrific, abusive treatment as electo convulsive therapy, and the lies people are being told in this new push to normalize It are disgusting.  One of the most troubling things I've seen in my lifetime.  This is a money making, profit driven industry that is abusing powerless people.  If you want the truth about something don't ask the doctors who are making money doing it, or the family members that want to give themselves a pass for allowing it to happen to their powerless family member.  The ""great results"" are otherwise known as ""punch drunk"" it doesn't last long, hence the reason to keep doing the treatments over and over.  A lot of people commit suicide after having this done, a lot of them struggle to remember their own children's names.  I have read family members say that their relatives were ""shells"" or ""zombies"" forever.  Remember this isn't being used as a last resort on every patient, it is being sold for depression now, not just schizophrenia.  And, as the author pointed out, schizophrenia has been used as a catch all label for things that cannot be lumped together in one category (like it has been used for years) that have a wide range of symptoms.  There are many options to take, but it is easier to warehouse people and fry their brains out.  When you write a book that has so many facts presented in it, many readers are not going to understand that the so-called facts you use about electro shock treatment are nothing more than what is in the glossy pamphlet the company that produces the machine is handing out.  I think this is irresponsible of the author.  Dig deeper, talk to families that actually care what has happened to someone in their family who had this, or read something written by someone who had it and feels destroyed by it.  That this was seen for what it is 30-40 years ago, and is now being resurrected is criminal.  I'm sure a ""kinder, gentler"" lobotomy will be coming to....you know with anesthesia before they drill a hole in your skull and a ""very precise"" instrument that they can destroy ""very selective"" parts of the brain.  Let's hope that someone can come up with a preventative to this horrific illness,  but in the meanwhile don't try and normalize electro shock treatment...absolutely barbaric.",3,0,5309,0.078,1
6,"The first thing to note is that this is not a Tim Keller book.  I understand that he's the biggest name associated with the book, but he's not the author.  He wrote one chapter and collaborated on the introduction and conclusion.  If there is a primary author, it would be John Inazu.  He's listed second on the cover, after Keller, but the book is essentially a further elaboration / exploration of a book he wrote called ""Confident Pluralism.""  The rest of the chapters (12 total) are written by other writers.  The only familiar names to me were Sara Groves and Lecrae.  (I did have one of those, ""Oh, that guy!"" moments when I read the chapter written by the guy who invited Black Lives Matter to speak at Urbana and was very surprised that anyone disagreed with this decision.  I remember that happening, but I didn't remember any names associated with it.)  Listen, there's nothing wrong with compilations.  I'm just camping out here for a minute, because some of the marketing for this book is misleading.  Based on the cover and the Amazon page, you would get the idea that Tim Keller wrote this book, with the assistance of someone you've likely never heard of named John Inazu.  (The thumbnail that led me to purchase this book only listed Tim Keller's name as the author.)  If that doesn't matter to you, great!  If you're a huge fan of John Inazu, then this book is for you.  If you love Lecrae or Sara Groves or any of the other contributors, then you might want to buy this.  Frankly, I'm a huge Tim Keller fan and might have purchased the whole book for his one chapter.  (I'm a Gen X'er and we used to buy whole albums for the one good song, so I'm used to it.)  You just need to know that this is NOT A TIM KELLER BOOK.I could go deeper, critiquing some chapters and praising others, but I'll just say that this is a very uneven compilation.  Some of the chapters are excellent!  (See Keller, Tim.)  Some of the chapters are just okay.  Some of the chapters were banal and sophomoric.  The chapter that lauded Pope Francis' immigration policies (musings?) made my eyes roll so violently that I almost lost consciousness.  (You can agree with his views on the refugee crisis or disagree with them, but this particular author made almost no attempt to engage the complexities of national borders and citizenship questions, beyond an admission that he / she interviewed some border guards and discovered to his / her great surprise that they were normal human beings.  I'm being generous to suggest that this particular chapter belonged on the editorial pages of a college newspaper.)Another reviewer rightly pointed out another problem with the book, namely, it's lack of specificity.  Are you ""walking with wounded wayfarers""?  Do you have ""reclaiming words"" on your checklist for the week?  I think I know what that means.  My guess is, you think you know what that means.  Do we both mean the same thing?  Probably not, which is (ironically) the problem the book is trying to solve.This is my final complaint, and it's a big one.  One of the reasons I love Tim Keller's preaching and writing is that he allows the gospel to critique both ""conservative"" and ""liberal"" positions … finding the good intentions and flawed assumptions that undergird both positions.  His chapter in this book is no exception.  It's fantastic.  The rest of the authors leave the impression that the real problem with the world is people like me - white, middle-aged, middle-class, suburban, politically and religiously conservative people.  That's fine.  I fully realize the depth of my sins and shortcomings.  Critique away!  My only question is, ""Is there no critique for anyone else?  Does the gospel have anything to say to left-leaning white people?  Does the gospel have nothing to say to black and brown people?  What about women?  What about 1% of people who are able to write best-selling books and albums?""  (If you haven't picked up on it, let me say this explicitly.  I'm describing the authors of the book, none of whom, with the exception of Keller and a man named Warren Kinghorn - the white grandson of an infamous segregationist - believe that Jesus has anything critical to say about them.)  The only author in the book who attempts to engage ""both sides"" with the gospel is Tim Keller.  The rest of the authors have a clear villain in mind - the white, middle-class, Republican, male, Evangelical … who is likely wearing a red ""Make America Great Again"" hat.  Does that guy exist?  Absolutely.  Is that person worthy of a gospel-centered critique?  Yes.  Is that person allowed to repent?  Sure.  But since the problem is structural and not individual, that person's individual repentance is essentially meaningless.  One-way critiques fill this book, which is its fatal flaw.  One-way critiques produce two-dimensional books, books which (ironically) undermine the whole idea of finding common ground.If you'd like to buy this book only for the Keller chapter, great!  It's a very good chapter.  If you're familiar with John Inazu and really resonated with his book about pluralism, you'll probably like this a lot.  If you're looking for ways to find ""common ground"" across religious, political, social, and gender lines … I would look elsewhere.",2,1,5262,0.137,1
7,"I admit to being fond of curmudgeonly heroes, and Grace Burrowes has a tendency to write them very well.  As I began to delve into A DUKE BY ANY OTHER NAME, and met Nathaniel Rothmere, Duke of Rothhaven, I almost lost heart.  In previous books by this author, grumpy heroes still always exuded the utmost courtesy and behaved like gentlemen to the fair sex.  Nathaniel was downright mean, abrupt, and rude to everyone, even the heroine.  He even went so far as to make threats.  As I got further into the story, I began to see why.  Nathaniel has a secret, a very large one, one that requires he keep absolutely everyone away from his home.  Therefore, he can’t make friendships because he can never allow friends to come to call.  He has to run his household with only the few elderly remaining servants who are totally loyal to him.  He can’t have a wife, or even a casual date.  And it appears this is to be his lot in life forever.Lady Althea Wentworth is now the sister of a duke, though her childhood was one of extreme poverty, neglect, and abuse.  Society is somewhat miffed at her brother inheriting a lofty title, but he is too powerful a man to cross.  So the cruel members of the ton show their displeasure by making life miserable for Althea instead.  After being mocked and subject to other little acts of viciousness, Althea decides to retreat to her Yorkshire estate and forego another London season.  She longs for children and a family of her own, yet she’s unable to fit in here either.  In desperation, she decides to call on the “Dread Duke,” and ask for his social advice.  When she’s turned away from his home multiple times, she takes a desperate step, guaranteed to bring the duke to her door.  Her unexpected action (involving piggies, no less) works, and a furious Rothhaven arrives in full blustery mode.Nathaniel is amazed to find himself having tea and sandwiches with his neighbor, whom he intended to intimidate.  He does flatly refuse to spend any further time with her, though he’s touched by her need to fit in.  He certainly recognizes her loneliness, as it’s an emotion he’s very familiar with.  Realizing he needs to escape, because he’s intrigued by this unconventional woman, Nathaniel does teach her how to give the cut direct.  He wishes her well, but lets her know they won’t be meeting again.Fate has other plans, as they do meet again.  Each meeting has their longing for the other growing stronger.  Nathaniel tells Althea there are reasons he can’t pursue a relationship, and she realizes that he’s carrying a heavy burden.  When an accident happens to a member of his household, and he’s unable to have a physician come to his home, Nathaniel is desperate enough to ask for Althea’s help.  As she stays at his home, nursing the invalid, she and Nathaniel finally give in to their passion, agreeing that it’s only a moment out of time, and can’t be anything permanent.The secret that Nathaniel is hiding is revealed fairly early in the story, but I think it’s one the reader should discover on their own.  Many more details are fleshed out as the story progresses, showing how Nathaniel is truly in an impossible situation.  As I was reading, I was thinking – oh, boy, how is this ever going to be resolved?  It’s heartbreaking to see these two lonely people who have found genuine love, but can’t find a way to make a future together.Nathaniel is a caring, loving, self-sacrificing man beneath the beastly persona he created, and I adore him.  Althea is capable, and a combination of strength and vulnerability, and is just what Nathaniel needs.  The resolution to Nathaniel’s situation is one that won’t be easy.  I realize that it will likely be explored further in the next book in the ROGUES TO RICHES series, and that’s one I am really, really eager to read.  Having said that, A DUKE BY ANY OTHER NAME can easily read as a standalone, and this couple does achieve their happy ever after.  The mystery part of this book was especially intriguing to me, and the details from the past were heartbreaking.  I’m happy that we’re so much more knowledgeable today about certain physical and mental illnesses, and the way we treat those afflicted.  I’m also sorry to say that bullying seems to be something that will never go away.  I highly recommend A DUKE BY ANY OTHER NAME for readers who enjoy not only a warm romance, but characters who are thoroughly fleshed out, a plot that’s unique, and situations that touch your emotions, all while entertaining you.I received a complimentary copy of this book.",5,0,4552,0.163,0
8,"Since I read a lot of books I usually read the reviews before buying  and am disappointed when reviewers spend more words telling you what the book was about rather than what they liked and disliked about a particular book.  This book was a good example.  I had read the first three books in this series and enjoyed them very much.  I love the Cosy Mysteries and find the character development in the very good ones enjoyable especially if the main character has a life issue they are working on while solving the mystery.  In the first three books Addie, who is our main character is dealing with the death of her fiancee and then the death of her father while trying to settle into a new town after her aunt dies and leaves her  not only a large Victorian home but also a book collection that has many priceless books in it.  In the process of opening a bookstore she of course discovers a dead body, meets the very good looking chief of police and involves herself in the investigation.  Through the first three books Addie and Marc, the chief of police, begin an interest in one another although Addie is still struggling with her fiancee's ' death.  In the second book, another character is added who also becomes a possible love interest.  Simon is the new doctor in town as well as the medical examiner so Addie in her sluthing becomes friendly with him which creates some problems with Marc.  By the end of the third book everything seems to be sorted out, Addie and Marc are going to take it slow in their relationship and Simon remains a friend.  Book four begins and the reader finds out during an investigation that Marc has been out of town for three months, has a new girlfriend and something has happened between Marc and Addie.  No explanation as to what happened and now Simon is back as a love interest.  An explanation comes later in the book but it just doesn't seem to work.  The characters development in the first three books were smooth but this seemed almost as if another writer had taken over and suddenly decided that everything should be changed.  In my opinion if the author wanted to change how Addie and Marc felt about one another book three should have had a different ending.  But to open this book and see how nasty she made Marc in his treatment of Addie just did not fit in with the character she had already started to develop.  Yes, he is a police officer who has to follow legal procedures and Addie does things her own way which annoyed him but she had contributed the clues needed to solve the cases in the first three books and while Marc did not like her going against what he asked her not to do, they seemed to have come to an understanding about that and he finally also understood in the third book that  Addie was still trying to get past her grief and open her head to someone new.  He was going to give her time but somewhere well into book four the reader finds out that three months after agreeing to slow down the relationship, he tries to give her an engagement ring and the relationship was over.  Just didn't play well with this reader.  At the end of book four, Addie is with Simon and a new love interest is there for Marc.  Suddenly both characters look very shallow and I am not sure at this point if I will read anymore of this series for perhaps in the next book Addie will decide that she loves Marc after all, or perhaps Simon will meet someone new, or maybe they all will say the heck with it and everyone will go their own way.  Usually, in all of the Cosy Mysteries I have read if there is a romantic interest the relationship develops over a number of books in the series and you can see them begin to adjust to the new relationship and make accommodations for each other as their relationship grows.  I did not see that in this series and after this book I am not sure I really like how the author changed both Addie and Marc's relationship so quickly.  To sudden to make it believable.  It jarred the plot line too much and as I read I kept trying to understand her sudden change in the relationships and why this sudden change.  I thought it interrupted the main story line and affected the way I looked at the characters of Addie and Marc!  Hence my three rating.  The other three would get a five but this, in my opinion was just barely a three.",3,1,4320,0.115,1
9,"When I was a rambunctious teen in the early 80's, I became a huge Van Halen fan and would spend hours listening to their adrenaline-pumpin' tunes.  I'd stare at the cassette liner notes and kept seeing these two names -- Ted Templeman and Donn Landee.  I had no idea who they were but they were on every VH record that came out so they had to be involved in the success of this band.  Well, this book finally sheds light on these two fellas and the true importance they had for Van Halen's meteoric rise to the top of the rock pantheon.The book reveals Ted to be a humble guy who grew up near San Francisco and his whole family was involved in the music industry in some capacity.  He spent his childhood working in a piano store his parents owned.  Then he tried his hand at being a performer and had a couple hits with Harper's Bizarre in the late 60's but Ted eventually realized his true passion was in producing music, not performing it and being on the road.  His big break came when he was asked to produce the first Doobie Brothers album in 1971.  His continued expertise in producing paid big dividends when he was told about an unsigned rock band in L.A. called ""Van Halen"".  Ted was blown away after seeing them playing to an empty room at the Starwood, and he signed them to Warner Bros. right on the spot.As a lifelong Roth-era Van Halen fan, I really loved this book because Ted lavished a ton of praise on David Lee Roth's lyrical genius and unique gifts as a frontman for the Mighty Van Halen.  The same kind of praise was being lavished in Noel Monk's book that came out a few years ago.  For decades, I've been sick of hearing some VH fans say ""Dave wasn't that great and Sammy was a better singer"".  Well, now you have two insiders who intimately knew the band during their glory years both saying the exact same thing --- David Lee Roth wasn't the most gifted vocalist, but he was a terrific frontman who was absolutely essential to the rapid rise of Van Halen to the peak of rock stardom and it's lasting legacy.  In fact, Ted admits that replacing DLR with Sammy Hagar in 1977 would have been ""the biggest mistake of my professional life"".  So there it is -- David Lee Roth was just as reponsible for making Van Halen the biggest rock band on the planet.  He deserves as much praise as Eddie Van Halen, and there's no other way you can spin those facts.  So please shut up with this ""Sammy was better"" nonsense because nobody is buying that malarkey.Just like Noel Monk, the Halen album ""1984"" was the bitter end for Ted and he seems to harbor some resentment toward the VH guys to this very day for how it all ended on a negative tone.  Templeman seems to take offense to things Eddie has said over the years about Ted's royalties from VH albums and how the whole Van Hagar situation unfolded.  Ted was asked to produce the first Van Hagar album ""5150"" but turned it down because he didnt want to tarnish the orginal lineup that he signed and made into superstars.  Then when Ted produced Dave's first two solo albums, Eddie became more convinced that Ted was picking Dave's side in the split and this caused more harsh feelings between the two.  But, Ted to this day still has admiration and respect for the unique talent of EVH.The book has kind of a sad ending when Ted talks about his termination from Warner Bros. in 1998.  He became depressed and sank into a lonely existence of alcoholism and some drug abuse for a few years after this happened.  The one odd aspect of the book is that Ted barely mentions his wife and kids even though he had a long happy marriage and children who loved him.  He quickly states that he moved his family from Pasadena to Montecito so his son could improve his asthma condition with cleaner air, there's very little we know about their life events.  Also, Ted subltly mentions that he owned several houses in the 80's and drove a Ferrari and Rolls Royce and had some lucrative real estate investments so it appears being a platinum producer paid handsomely in those days.  I just hope Ted Templeman gets inducted into the Rock 'N Roll Hall of Fame before he dies because he deserves the recognition for producing some of the biggest rock albums of the 70's and 80's.",5,0,4228,0.147,0

11,"The Demon Lord Asroth is finally free from his century long imprisonment, and what he has unleashed on Drassil and the Banished Lands is nothing short of an invasion of the damned.  And as if fighting against the dreaded Kadoshim hordes wasn't bad enough, the faithful must also contend with a swarm of violent undead killing machines called Revenants who were created by the bite of Gulla, one of the high captains of the Kadoshim.  Time could very well be running out on the Ben-Elim and their allies and darkness seems almost certain to prevail when all is said and done.The only hope to potentially beat back the looming slaughter and annihilation rests with a band of determined fighters called the Order of the Bright Star made up of a handful of Ben-Elim and various displaced warriors from the kingdom of Drassil.  Among those who would stand against Asroth and his army is Drem, former trapper turned newest recruit of the Order.  What this group of would-be saviors of the realm lack in brute power and numbers, they more than make up for in superior strategy and guile.  But is that enough?Is it truly enough to prevail in the final cataclysmic battle against a virtually invincible foe that shows absolutely no feelings or mercy?  Truth and Courage will be the defining rallying cry as swords clash, bones break, and fallen bodies litter the landscape of the Banished Lands.  You will not want to miss how it all ends and who emerges victorious in the end.Well that was one of the finest reads I have ever had the pleasure of experiencing.  I knew this book was going to be one hell of a closing book, but I wasn't necessarily prepared for exactly what a smashing finale it would be.  To call this book a thrill a minute would be to sell it very short.  The sheer number of battles and amount of action that takes place in just this one book alone would fill most fantasy series in their entirety.  John Gwynne said he wanted the series to end with a bang and by golly he is true to his word and then some.There was not a moment in A TIME OF COURAGE when I felt like I could take a breath to gather myself and when I had to put the book down for any period of time at all, I was angry because I needed to keep going.  The Kadoshim are still some of the most vile and ruthless antagonists I have ever read and part of what makes this book and series so awesome is that you literally loathe them.  Part of this is due to the fact that yes, some of my favorite characters fall at their taloned hands, and so when you read a chapter where they are present you never know if someone important to you will perish painfully.It's one of the things among many that John Gwynne does really really well.  He puts your beloved characters in danger page after page and not knowing what may happen to them makes the reading investment that much more of a real one.  There are very few happy endings where things get all tied up in a bow for you with John's books, and it is part of the reason why I relish reading his stuff.  It's gritty, no-holds-barred, no apologies epic fantasy the way that it should be written.If you want to read some of the very best fantasy going right now, pick up this series immediately.  I will say that I would recommend that you read his first series The Faithful and the Fallen before venturing into this one if you want the best possible experience in my opinion.  It isn't absolutely necessary as this is a self-contained trilogy, but I believe that having a solid understanding of who everyone is historically-speaking and why certain places are important will only serve to make Of Blood and Bone that much more rewarding when you undertake the journey.I'm very sad that this series is over but at the same time I am totally psyched for John Gwynne's new upcoming series which will be Viking-based and take us away from The Banished Lands (at least for a little while).  It will be interesting to see John stretch his legs in a brand new setting filled with different characters.",5,0,4013,0.151,1
12,"The most important thing I would say to anyone who wants to read this book is it is difficult.  I've read quite a few physics books for non-scientists, and these books almost always are as advertised--well-written discussions of cutting-edge physics for laypersons.  Professor Smolin's book, by contrast, is quite difficult (I believe) and assumes a certain scientific literacy that former English majors like me don't have.  So, be warned.  This book is difficult.  And, to be honest, there are parts of this book I probably don't understand correctly, so be warned about that too when you're reading this review.The issues raised by Professor Smolin are so important that it's well worth the hard work to understand what he's getting at.  Basically, a number of physicists and philosophers over the years have worried about the direction that physics seems to be taking.  Professor Smolin is one of them, and he refers to them and himself as Realists.  Realists are scientists and philosophers who share Einstein's uneasiness with quantum physics.  They believe, as I understand it, that the ""spookiness"" of quantum physics suggests that quantum physics is not complete.  For example, the Many Worlds theory, which suggests that reality is constantly splitting into an essentially infinite number of alternative universes, simply seems too crazy to be true.  (My words, not Professor Smolin's).  Then, there are matters such as quantum entanglement and the measurement problem that make it difficult for physics to arrive at a complete theory that comports with our common sense experience of reality.So, the basic issue addressed by this book is the controversy between realists like Smolin and Einstein and anti-realists, who currently are in the majority and who are comfortable with quantum strangeness.  Professor Smolin notes that the dominance of the anti-realists' ideas has a lot to do with how academia works.  The anti-realists have dominated academia for decades, and if you want to be taken seriously (and get your Ph.D.!), it's best to go with the flow.Professor Smolin is not going with the flow.  He believes that the fact that quantum physics fails to account for the objective reality we all experience strongly suggests that quantum theory is incomplete (as Einstein also believed).  Smolin discusses realist theories that might be more satisfactory, but he acknowledges that these theories are not totally convincing, and there is a much that needs to be done.  Nonetheless, he is optimistic that a realist approach to physics will eventually demonstrate that quantum physics is incomplete and that a Realist alternative is possible (and necessary).As a lawyer, I'm not competent to evaluate Professor Smolin's ideas for a realist theory of physics.  However, as someone who has read a number of books by brilliant physicists and who has thought that the ""reality"" they were describing seemed troublingly bizarre, I am happy that there are physicists who are contrarians that are challenging the dominant anti-realist theories.I also like the fact that Professor Smolin respects the ideas and contributions of philosophers.  Many of the physics books I've read seem to have very little respect for philosophy, which I think is unfortunate.  Professor Smolin is exceptional.  Although this book is most definitely a science book, Professor Smolin takes philosophy seriously, particularly the work of Leibniz.  Smolin's deep understanding of the philosophical issues raised by physics is one of this book's greatest strengths.  (For example, Smolin's discussion of the ethical implications of the Many Worlds hypothesis is excellent.  If all possibilities will eventually be realized in one of the many alternate universes, then why care about right or wrong?  Scientific theories are not morally neutral, and Smolin understand that fact).So, bottom line:  if you're looking for a little light reading to take with you to the beach this summer, this is not the book for you.  And, if, like me, you did not major in science, you will most likely find this to be a difficult book.  However, the issues that Professor Smolin raises are very important.  I think he is right:  somewhere, somehow, physics has taken the wrong turn.  The disconnect between quantum physics and the objective world that we experience does indeed suggest that quantum theory is incomplete.  The search for ""what lies beyond the quantum"" goes on.",4,0,4439,0.118,1
13,"After mercifully being widowed, the former Margaret Finley left Dorset, and set out to make a new life for herself with her loyal friend, Beth.  Now known as Minerva Hepplewhite, she longs to put all thoughts of her abusive deceased husband behind her and begin anew.  Though there were grumblings of suspicion that Minerva was responsible for the late Algernon Finley’s death, there was never any proof.  One night, Minerva and Beth capture an intruder in their home.  They have the man solidly under control, and he proceeds to inform them that he brings news that Minerva has been left a sizable fortune by his late uncle, the former Duke of Hollinburgh, a man Minerva has never met.Chase Radnor is a gentleman, and a former soldier who occasionally does investigative work, some for the Crown, some for hire.  His uncle’s death seems suspicious to him, and so he plans to scrutinize all those who would benefit from the duke’s demise, including his own family.  While the entailed properties automatically transfer to the new duke, the sizable amount of cash and investments was bequeathed to three women, one of them being Minerva, none of them known to the family.  Chase was hoping to find information in Minerva’s home, when he was unexpectedly caught and bound.Minerva is shocked and disbelieving, at first, that a man she doesn’t know would leave her a fortune.  She meets with the solicitor Chase directed her to, and discovers that she is about to be an heiress.  With her uncertain future now secure, Minerva intends to pursue her own desire to be an investigator.  Her first case will be her own – why would the Duke of Hollinburgh leave her a fortune?  Her path is obviously going to cross with Chase’s, over and over again, as he is on the same quest.Right from the start, I loved the relationship between Chase and Minerva.  He is clearly suspicious of her, yet he speaks the truth about his suspicions without being obnoxious, rude, or heavy handed.  He acts like the gentleman he is, a fact that is greatly appreciated by Minerva, who has been used to a life of abuse and scorn.  They “sort of” agree to share information with each other, though they do tend to hold back little things.  As they get to know each other better, they feel an attraction, as well as a respect for each other, and decide that neither of them is guilty.To her surprise, Minerva begins to feel desire for Chase, something she thought had been beaten out of her by her husband.  She sees the matching longing in his eyes, and very slowly, she allows kisses and embraces, gradually overcoming her fear of intimacy.  Chase’s care and patience with Minerva as she regains her sexuality is breathtaking.  He’s an amazing man, one very easy to fall in love with.  Though Chase realizes that he wants more than an affair, Minerva has made it clear that she will never remarry.  Her newfound financial independence solidifies her resolve to never be bound to a man again.HEIRESS FOR HIRE is a fantastic book to read, both for the mystery, as well as the steamy romance.  This is the start of a new series, and while we do learn the probable reason the duke left a fortune to Minerva, we don’t positively find out the identity of his murderer, though there are plenty of hints and suspects.  We meet Chase’s extended family, many of them with strong motives, as well as a possibility outside the family.  I’m guessing that will finally be resolved in the final book.  Chase and Minerva, do, however, achieve their happy ending, and it is a sweet one.  HEIRESS FOR HIRE is one of those “read in one sitting” books, as the plot, excellent writing, and strong, likeable characters captivated me throughout.  I’m usually so focused on the hero, that it takes a really strong heroine to grab my attention, but Minerva did that.  I admire both of them for their character, their strength, and their genuine kindness and determination.  Their chemistry and heart touching romance makes for a delicious and satisfying read, which I highly recommend.As reviewed at rosesareblue dot net.

14,"In a distinguished joint career, Richard Pevear and Larissa Volokhonsky have gifted us with more than 20 books translated from the Russian of  Bulgakov, Chekhov, Dostoyevsky,  Gogol, Leskov,  Pasternak,  Pushkin, and Tolstoy.  (Pevear on his own has also translated from the French.  His translation of Dumas’ THE THREE MUSKETEERS enabled me to grasp all the rich comedy I of course missed in that classic as a boy.)Now this indispensable couple have given us new translations of FIFTY-TWO STORIES by Anton Chekhov.  52 — “a perfect deck,” as Pevear observes in his preface.  For a stellar year, you might read one story each week.From his 1887 story “The Siren”:  “A local justice of the peace, Milkin, a young man with a languid, melancholy face, reputed to be a philosopher, displeased with his milieu and seeking a purpose in life, stood by the window and looked sorrowfully outside.”  In stark contrast, the fat main character in the same story rhapsodizes at length on the glories of eating and describes a lavish meal in detail:  “ … homemade honey spiced vodka is better than any champagne.  After the first glass, your whole soul is  engulfed in a sort of fragrant mirage and it seems that you’re not at home in your armchair, but somewhere in Australia on some sort of ultrasoft ostrich.”  (I wondered what “ultrasoft” was in the original Russian and was pretty sure careful time was spent arriving at a serviceable equivalent — not recognized, I happily note, by SpellCheck.)Perhaps the most unusual story in the collection, seeming a children’s story until it begins to deepen, is “Kashtanka,” in which half the characters are animals.  I know there are folks who tell us we should never call anything perfect, but Chekhov’s portrayal of a goose tempts me to go ahead and make the claim.Nowhere is Chekhov’s handling of the effects of social disparities more effective than in the final story in the collection, “The New Dacha.”  Here’s a passage from that story that will give you a sense of the heft and sparkle of Chekhov’s language as translated by Pevear and Volokhonsky:“On a clear, warm morning at the end of May, two horses were brought to Rodion Petrov,  the Obruchanovo blacksmith, to be reshod.  They were from the New Dacha.  The  horses were white as snow, sleek, well-fed, and strikingly resembled each other.“ ‘Perfect swans!’ Rodion exclaimed, looking at them in awe.“His wife Stepanida, his children and grandchildren came outside to look.  A crowd gradually gathered.  The Lychkovs came, father and son, both beardless from birth, with swollen faces and hatless.  Kozov also came, a tall, skinny old man with a long, narrow  beard and a stick with a crook; he kept  winking his sly eyes and smiling mockingly as if he knew something.”Ubiquitous themes in Chekhov are boredom, frustration and exhaustion, but his stories are never boring, frustrating or exhausting because his attention to details of character and place is so sharp.  He is one of the most compassionate writers we’ve ever had among us, and even the weakest of his stories is an earnest undertaking to understand.I can’t improve upon Pevear’s eloquent closing paragraph in his preface:  “In his stories, Chekhov does what storytellers have always done: he satirizes human pretensions and absurdities, he plays out the comedy of human contradictions, and ultimately, even in the darkest of them, he celebrates natural and human existence in all its conditional variety.”Even by todays’s low standards, the physical production of the book is impressive — no surprise with a book coming from the distinguished imprint of Knopf.  The striking dust jacket design by John Gall features what I take to be printers’ devices of the period.On the rear flyleaf of the book, we get that endearing photograph of the translators in their home in France, a photograph that welcomely started appearing in their books about halfway through their career.  Looking at it once more, I  can just hear Volokhonsky:  “Oh, Richard, that paragraph is so good.  You deserve a glass of armagnac.  Let me get it for you, and I believe I’ll have one myself.”  I wish I were there to raise a toast to them.",5,0,4172,0.135,1
15,"The Good Assassin, by Steven Talty, is a riveting story about the Mossad's hunt for Nazi war criminal, Herbert Cuckers.  The book is a page turner from start to finish.Before beginning the review, I just wanted to point out that this is the kind of book that is incredibly important at this time.  There seems to be a rekindled interest in exploring the Nazi era.  Television shows and movies such as Man in the High Castle, Plot Against America, JoJo Rabbit, and Hunters are showing fictionalized versions of Nazism.  In particular, the show Hunters has a group of vigilantes that hunt down Nazi war criminals in America.  Sadly, the Nazi hunters themselves are ficitonal as are the Nazis they are hunting down.  Even worse, the Nazi atrocities pictured are also fictional and in many cases not even based on real atrocities committed by Nazis.  This book is yet another case where fact is more compelling than fiction.  You will read about actual Nazi hunters hunting an actual Nazi who committed actual Nazi atrocities.  This book is even more compelling than its fictional counterparts, because the hunters are real, the Nazi was real, and the atrocities--as brutal and cruel as the fictional ones--actually happened.Herbert Cuckers, also known as the Butcher of Latvia, was part of the Arajs Kommando and is known to have led or took part atrocities as part of the Nazi occupation of Latvia, including the Rumbula massacre and burning of synogogues in Riga.  After the war, Cuckers, who was an Latvian national hero for work as an aviation pioneer, made his way to Brazil after the war and started a touring business.  He was not difficult for the Mossad to find as, unlike other exNazi commanders, he never changed his name.The Mossad's hunt for Cuckers occured in the context of a vote in the West German Bundestag that would have given amnesty to all Nazi war criminals.  This gave urgency to the Mossad's search for Cuckers, as they needed an example to show the world that there were still important Nazi criminals that committed crimes against humanity that needed to be captured and remind West Germany and the world that such crimes should not have a statute of limitations.Talty covers a lot of ground, detailing Cuckers crimes during Nazi occupation of Latvia through records and eye-witness accounts from survivors (especially Zelma Shepshelovitz).  He details Cucker's life before, during, and after WWII, the background of the Mossad agents set to capture him, and details the plot to capture him.  He even describes the political controversies regarding the amnesty legislation in Germany from both German and Jewish perspectives.This is a lot of ground to cover and you might think that this might somehow make this book a dry history.  Nothing could be farther from the truth.  This book is a potboiler, a page turner from page one.  It is no surprise that Talty has written detective fiction.  He has a flair for story telling and ratcheting up suspense, even for someone familiar with the story and knows the ending of the book before it happens.  The book reads like a novel but is not a novelization--Talty always stays true to the history.  It is not footnoted, but there are extensive references, chapter by chapter, at the end of the book.That said, this book is meant for a lay audience.  It is history but is not written for historians.  Talty does not take a lot of time parsing philosophy or deeply looking into motivations.  He only briefly addresses the ethics behind targeted assassinations by governments (as opposed to capture and trial).  There is enough historic context to explain the plot, but Talty doesn't elaborate on this any more than is required to enhance the story line.All-in-all, Talty gives us an incredible slice of history and he should be applauded for bringing the Mossad's hunt for Herbert Cuckers to the attention of the lay public.  This is expertly written, real history for the lay public, something that is sorely needed in a world where our entertainment industry feels it is important to write fictional stories 'based on' historical characters.",4,0,4109,0.054,1
16,"""Something She's Not Telling Us: A Novel"" by Darcey Bell is kind of an interesting name for a novel which, as far as I can tell, has a near pathological fear of not telling anything.  There are no secrets in this novel; not too much of a twist, and not much that a reader can't guess.We begin with our stiff-as-a-board protagonist, Charlotte, whose brother Rocco is about to bring yet another girlfriend to meet Charlotte, her husband Eli, and their daughter, Daisy.  Rocco has a history of dating women who are extremely unstable.  So unstable, in fact, that six-year-old Daisy is frightened of meeting Rocco's new girlfriend, for fear that she might be as crazy as Rocco's previous kleptomaniac girlfriend, who stole her beloved toy.  However, Ruth, Rocco's new girlfriend, appears to be friendly, calming everyone's fears, except for Charlotte, who gets upset that Ruth brings sticky buns for dessert.  This means that Ruth a.) has exposed Daisy to sugar, b.) has brought sugar into the house for dessert instead of the walnuts and fruit that Charlotte has planned, and c.) has the nerve to enjoy Daisy's company.Daisy, surprisingly, reciprocates Ruth's feelings, and instead of acting in her usual shy manner, begins to bond unusually well with Ruth.  Charlotte reacts with unusually hostile emotions, trying to keep Ruth at arms' length and sheltering Daisy in a closed and suffocating manner.We learn very early on that Daisy has been picked up from school by someone identified as Ruth, the day after the entire family has returned from a visit to Rocco and Charlotte's mother in Mexico.  The rest of the novel hinges on the unwinding of the previous six months beforehand as we meander through the lives of our main characters, trying to care about what happened.But do we?  This is the crux of the problem.  None of these characters appealed to me at all.  Charlotte's character isn't worried about her six-year-old asthmatic daughter:  she's paranoid, nearly delusional and suffocating.  I don't even know if this is an intentional characterization on the part of the author, or if the author simply knows nothing about children.  This character was BIZARRE.  Not only do I not care about her; I actively DISLIKE her.  The rest of the characters are equally non-compelling.  We have a distant, non-relational husband, a brother willing to ignore pretty important red flags in order to keep his life running smoothly, and a ""crazy"" mother who ran away to Mexico years ago, whose pathology never really plays an important part in this narrative at all.  Charlotte's therapist shows up.  Ruth is Rocco's new squeeze, his first sane girlfriend...or is she?*SPOILERS*  If you care!As a matter of fact, all of the characters are cardboard.  This novel is written by switching narrators and points of view.  Some of the characters are unreliable; some of the characters are lying...but honestly, in a strange kind of way, the entire story was laid out for us in the first few chapters.  This is one of the strangest novels I've ever read, in that there wasn't an enormous twist anywhere.  I kept reading, trying to find something deeper or compelling about the narrative, some a-ha! moment that would make this whole strange compendium of walking, wooden characters make sense, but it never happened.  In the first few pages, the author told us the basic story...and...that was the plot.  The end.  There wasn't really too much else.  Even the ""why"" was a kind of ho-hum out-of-nowhere un-twist twist that we've heard before.  We've become familiar with these tired tropes of delusional people who have lost track of reality.  It's a lazy way to plot a thriller.The novel had no terrible grammatical errors.  Sentence structure was correct, as far as I could tell.  It suffered from the tyranny of being...adequate.  It nominally held together.  It's terribly all right.  And in that, it's awful.  It's a novel in which the characters are unappealing, in a situation that doesn't capture the attention, in a story that goes exactly nowhere.  Read at your own risk, but better yet, don't.  Go read a better novel, with entertaining characters.",1,0,4145,0.08,1
17,"He came to her bar and asked her out twice a year for five years, she finally said yes and all hell broke loose.  I’ve had my eye on Chantal Fernando’s books for a while and finally took the plunge.  It was a good time and I will definitely want more.Temper is the third in the Knights of Fury series.  It read easily as my first book, but it did have a series arc plot that seemed to culminate in this story and the previous couples were strong players in this one.  I would definitely recommend starting with Saint and then Renegade first.Abbie’s been working her family bar out on the desert in a small town between Vegas and LA since she was old enough to help out.  Her biggest goal was to finish college and get out of town to see the world, but her mom’s stroke got her off track for her dream and she’ll probably be keeping bar forever.  The only bright spot is the sexy tatted biker who has been stopping into the bar a couple times a year for the last five years.  Each time Temper asks her out, she says no and they go on to catch up on their lives.Except this time, Abbie doesn’t want to say no and wants to let her hair down for a little while before getting back to family duty.  A date with the much older Temper where he gets creative and gives her the best night of her life and she can relish the sizzle of attraction between them before he heads back on the road.Only, it doesn’t end with that scorching kiss, but gunfire and Abbie’s staid life is upended.  She gets an unwanted glimpse into the darker world of the man who stars in her dreams.  She wanted to get out of town and see the world.  She wanted to play with fire and is she now about to get burned?  Someone’s after the Knights of Fury and Abbie is caught in the crossfire.  Secrets come to light and things heat up with Temper.  Dare she take the risk?I enjoyed this first person narrative told by Abbie, the slightly naive, but level-headed woman who grew up small town and never got the chance to leave.  She had a sweet nature, but there was also steel in her spine so that she might be all new to the MC world, but she’s no pushover.  This is a biker romance and there are a bunch of alpha guys, but Abbie doesn’t get lost in the shuffle and gets the chance to get in on the action.I loved the way she and Temper had been building a friendship over those years she put him off and they felt ready when they finally got their opportunity.  He made a mistake, but owned it and he was so patient and good with Abbie.  The age gap was mentioned and considered, but not dwelt on.  I was glad because there was plenty of other conflict to keep the book lively and moving.There was a nice suspense element with who was coming after the club and attacking them which brought some good action and excitement especially with the big climax scene.This is a biker romance, but it wasn’t dark or gritty.  There is a sweetness in the friendships especially among the gals and there is a heartwarming feel of family among the club members.  The romance had some spice, but it was also very sweet the way Temper courted her.  He was commanding without being a jerk and Abbie had good spirit, but wasn’t stubborn at the wrong times.  Great couple!All around this was an engaging book and I want to go back for the two previous ones while eagerly awaiting the rest of the series.  I think this series would make a good starting point for those who want to try out biker romances and is also a good match for those who prefer the more moderate biker element.",4,0,3525,0.212,0
18,"I read Grady Hendrix's ""Horrorstor"" last year, and enjoyed not only its unique format but its premise of a horror story taking place in one of the most banal and unexpected settings of all.  It made me want to check out more books by this author, and so when ""The Southern Book Club's Guide to Slaying Vampires"" came out this year, I knew I had to give it a shot.  And boy, was it a roller-coaster ride of a book -- but in a good way.  Not only is it a horrifying but thrilling story of a group of suburban moms trying to defeat a vampire, but it contains a powerful and just as horrifying drama about the ugliness that lurks beneath the most put-together-looking families and neighborhoods.Patricia is doing her best to be the perfect suburban mother in a well-to-do Southern neighborhood, but allows herself one guilty pleasure -- a book club where she and her friends read lurid but entertaining true-crime books.  So when the arrival of a handsome and charming neighbor coincides with children going missing in a neighboring (and poorer) neighborhood, Patricia wonders if it's just her imagination running away with her.  But the new neighbor proves to be something even more terrifying than she can imagine... and even as this monster infiltrates her neighborhood and family, she and the book club must band together to save their families, even if it means defying their husbands to do so...Hendrix has a talent for weaving supernatural horror and ordinary settings together almost seamlessly, and captures the feeling of the early '90s quite well.  The beginning of the book starts off slow, but helps us get to know the characters better and delivers a slow burn towards a shattering climax.  And it isn't afraid to delve into the social and racial divides that split this Southern neighborhood, and how the book's monster takes full advantage of this divide to accomplish his sinister goals.  (Incidentally, this book is apparently a companion book to ""My Best Friend's Exorcism,"" but it's not necessary to read that one before reading this one.)Often the characters in horror media are either stereotypes or very thinly characterized -- usually so the viewer doesn't feel too bad when the inevitably-cooler monster kills them off.  This book, however, takes care to flesh out all the characters, making them flawed but relatable.  Patricia in particular is a likable character, one who is striving to be a good wife and mother but finds herself chafing against the strictures of what her emotionally-distant husband and her good ol' Southern values expect of her.  And to be perfectly honest, some of the domestic horrors she faces -- the ostracizing of her neighbors and former friends, and the emotional manipulation and gaslighting of her husband -- are just as horrifying as anything the monster does.If I have any complaints, it's that most of the action takes place in the final third of the book -- though the slow buildup helps amp up the suspense and terror to some degree -- and that once again rape is used as a tool to degrade and terrorize a female character.  I dislike rape being used as a trope solely to terrorize a female character, though at least this book handled it far better than other books I've read.  Still... there are more ways to add drama to a book with female characters than rape...A chilling blend of suburban horror and domestic drama, ""The Southern Book Club's Guide to Slaying Vampires"" is a frightening yet exciting read, and one of the most memorable books I've read this year.  It gets pretty gruesome in parts and can be uncomfortable to read if you've been through an abusive relationship, but it's proof that Grady Hendrix is a distinctive new voice in horror.  I look forward to more great things from him.",5,0,3760,0.168,0
19,"As the fourth son of an earl, Nicholas Rokesby had to choose a vocation, and is presently studying in Scotland to become a physician.  He is alarmed upon receiving a note from his father, urging him to return home as soon as he can.  Thinking of the worst possible scenarios, Nicholas rushes home at a crucial time in his studies, to learn that the reason for his summons is that the daughter of their neighbors and close friends had been kidnapped.  Though the young lady was returned unharmed, her reputation is now shattered.  Nicholas, while happy to learn that his friend is fine, is puzzled as to why he had to be brought home.  Then he learns that his parents intend that he marry Georgiana in order to redeem her from scandal.Georgiana Bridgerton had a few outings with Freddie Oakes, never realizing his intent to marry her and her sizable dowry.  The fortune hunter never even asked for her hand in marriage before he absconded with her, hoping to force her to wed in order to save her reputation.  Georgiana is far from helpless, and managed to escape Freddie, who then proceeded to share the story, still hoping to force her hand.  Georgiana refuses to marry him, choosing to accept ruin rather than marry the scoundrel.Initially, Nicholas refuses his father’s “suggestion” that he marry Georgiana.  After all, he had been hoping to marry for love, as his siblings did.  Still, the ties between the two families are very strong, and Georgie’s brother, Edmund, is Nicholas’ best friend.  Nicholas likes Georgie, but never thought of her in any romantic sort of way.  He decides to propose, and after an initial refusal, Georgie rethinks her answer, and decides to accept.  It seems she never had any romantic thoughts about Nicholas either.Both sets of parents are overjoyed, and attempt to take over the situation, showering the couple with servants, furnishings, carriages, and even a residence.  Nicholas and Georgie marry immediately by special license, and set off for Scotland, as Nicholas must return to his studies.  Nicholas and Georgie are committed to making their marriage a success, building on the foundation of their friendship and family ties.  They begin to look at each other through new eyes, seeing lovers and partners, as they embark on their new adventure.FIRST COMES SCANDAL is one of those rare, lovely books where the focus is on the couple getting to know each other and falling in love without huge drama or conflict.  The only discord is in the first part of the book when they are wrestling with whether they will marry or not.  I love this couple’s compatibility and how they seem to be so in sync with each other.  Neither is very experienced sexually, but their eagerness to please each other leads to a hot physical relationship.  There is plenty of Julia Quinn’s trademark humor, as one scene in particular, which takes place in a tree outside Georgie’s bedroom had me literally laughing out loud.  That alone makes this book worth reading, but there’s so much more.  I felt so good as I became immersed in this story, as I only had to sigh and enjoy their fabulous journey to love.  FIRST COMES SCANDAL is a light, steamy, entertaining, and romantic delight guaranteed to leave you smiling.  I loved this couple, and along with my favorite tropes of friends to lovers and marriage of convenience all wrapped up in one book, I was in reading paradise.(Note:  This is a Bridgerton prequel, but can easily be read as a standalone.  For those who have read the series, Anthony, Benedict, and Colin Bridgerton appear here as young boys and an infant, respectively.  Georgie is their aunt.)As reviewed at rosesareblue dot net.

20,"Shorefall is the second book in Robert Jackson Bennett’s The Founder’s Trilogy and it’s also one of my most anticipated reads of 2020 because I loved the first book, Foundryside, so much.  It’s always hard to review the second book in a series because of the tricky balance between enticing new readers to the series without spoiling it, but hopefully I can find that balance.Shorefall exceeded my expectations on so many levels.  Sometimes I find that middle books in trilogies feel like they’re full of filler and just trying to stretch things out to the climax of the final book.  There’s none of that with Shorefall though.  It’s an action-packed story that definitely furthers the plot in every way and adds layer upon layer of suspense along the way.My favorite part about Shorefall is getting to revisit the cast of characters I grew to love so much in the first book.  Sancia, Orso, Bereneice, and Gregor – my favorite morally gray, found family – are just as wonderful and easy to cheer on in this second book as they were in Foundryside, perhaps even more so as they’ve truly come together as a little family.  When we meet up with them in Shorefall, it’s a couple of years after the events of Foundryside and Sancia, Orso and the gang have created their own consulting firm that revolves around the magical scriving technology.  Their goal with this business is two-fold:  1) to help everyone who can, master the art of scriving, and 2) to thus take power out of the hands of the greedy merchant houses who have dominated their city for so long.  I loved the Robin Hood-esque feel to what they were doing.  They’re still as morally gray as ever, but their cause is a noble one.New characters also made Shorefall an absolutely gripping read for me.  An ancient (and super creepy!) hierophant, one of the first practitioners of scriving, has somehow been resurrected and is making a beeline for the city, leaving a trail of destruction and devastation in his wake.  His agenda remains to be seen, but Sancia, Orso and the others soon realize that the merchant houses are the least of their problems and they must turn their attention to defeating this new enemy before he destroys them and everything they’ve been working for.  I don’t want to give away anything about this character, but wow, he made my skin crawl every time he made an appearance!What made Shorefall such an all around great read for me was just how well so many elements are woven together.  There’s the high stakes action and adventure of trying to defeat this ancient creepy guy, but there’s also a deeper exploration of the magical scriving as we watch the characters pool their talents and try to use the magic in new ways to fight the enemy.  And finally, we are also given a more in-depth look at the history of some of the beloved characters from the series.  There’s so much going on but it all feels effortlessly woven together, which made it so easy to become fully immersed in this world and its characters all over again.My only quibble with Shorefall is that I wanted to see Clef, one of my absolute favorite characters from the first novel, and I felt like I had to wait way too long for him to put in an appearance.  Thankfully, it was well worth the wait, but I did feel myself growing a little impatient waiting for him.Even with that quibble, however, Shorefall is still a stellar read and one that I highly recommend to anyone who is looking for a fantasy with morally gray characters that you’ll fall in love with as well as unique worldbuilding and phenomenal storytelling.  The Founders Trilogy has it all!",5,0,3607,0.178,0
21,"RATING 4.5 STARSBurn Zone is book one in the brand new series, Hotshots, by Annabeth Albert.  This is my very first book by Annabeth but she’s long been on my want to read list.  This is a M/M romance with two sexy firefighters that bring on all kinds of swoons.Jacob Hartman is twenty five years old.  Years before he came out to his family.  He didn’t want to hide who he was.  Jacob’s late older brother was a smoke jumper, a firefighter that parachutes into dangerous fires.  As is his brother’s closest friend, Linc, who Jacob has had a crush on since he was nineteen years old.  But he’s not that nineteen year old kid any longer.  Jacob also wants to be a smoke jumper, he’s done everything he could to prepare for this for years.  Is it a risk taking a job for the same crew where his brother worked, where Linc still works?  Yes.  Because that attraction he felt for Linc all those years ago, it’s still there, stronger than ever.  And this time, he’s determined to do something about it.Linc Reid is ten years older than Jacob.  Even back when Jacob was nineteen, Linc felt that “something” between them.  That pull, that need.  But he had made a promise to Jacob’s brother, hands off.  Very few know that Linc was gay.  But Jacob knew, just as he knew that he was trying to deny his attraction to him.  Now Jacob is his partner at work.  Now he has to fight his feelings for him every single day.  If a man can’t keep his word, what kind of a man is he?  He promised Jacob’s brother.  But Jacob is nothing if not persistent.  Linc can only hold out for so long.“Need didn’t listen to reason, cared not about well thought out rationale, and need continued to grow, wild and frantic.”As Linc and Jacob spent time together, both at work, and outside of work, what was once just physical attraction grew, to so much more.  They learned each other’s minds as well as their bodies.  But their time together had an expiration date.  Because Linc couldn’t be what Jacob deserved.  He couldn’t let go of the past.  He couldn’t give him what he needed.  When the smoke jumping season is over, he’s leaving.I believe as romance readers, we all must believe that there is that “one” person out there for everyone.  And that when you meet that person, you feel something different, as did Linc and Jacob, even though you might now understand what you are feeling.  But Linc is battling with his own perception of honor, and with his own perception of himself.  His heart wants him, his mind says no.  There might be ten years between these two but let me tell you that Jacob is so mature.  His persistence, his patience with Linc, was a beautiful thing.  When Linc let down his guard, these two were so perfect together.  I loved them as a couple.  They have a bumpy road to travel, though, until they can find their way.I really did love this book.  The only reason it didn’t get five full stars is because I felt like it was a bit slow at times.  I’m an impatient reader and wanted things to move along.  But, the connection between these two was so beautiful.  I felt ALL the swoons.  This is my favorite kind of M/M couple, where both men are equal in strength and will, true partners.  As I said earlier, I’ve been wanting to try this author for some time now and am so glad I finally did.  There will definitely be more books by her in my future.  I can’t wait to see what might come next in this series.“I’m Yours.”“Jacob.  Always Jacob.”",5,0,3443,0.165,0
22,"There will be spoilers for book one (Wicked Saints) in my review.Wicked Saints was one of my favorites last year, so I had pretty high expectations going into Ruthless Gods.  It didn’t disappoint me.  I *may* have even liked it more.  The book took me about two hours longer than normal to read, but there was so much to take in.  This book is dark and detailed.  I love Emily’s writing.Ruthless Gods starts off months after Wicked Saints ended.  Malachiasz is gone and Nadya had been hiding out with Serefin.  He is back from the dead and needs to be the king.  Serefin isn’t sure why he’s hiding an enemy, but he does it anyway.  Until someone decides they want to take over and they know Nadya is there.  The witch had some predictions before they left.Nadya hasn’t been hearing from the Gods anymore.  Serefin has an old God living inside of him.  There are actually two people and they use his eye to make him see.  The voices are constant and getting to Serefin.  Malachiasz is lost being the Black Vulture.  His humanity is almost gone.  He and Nadya are connected somehow through magic.  She has to find him, make him realize who he is, and take him to a holy place that will likely kill him.  Nadya both loves and hate Malachiasz.  The boy she fell in love with is still there, but the Vulture is always there, too.  She has to choose between her country and the gods and her love for this boy.  Nadya woke up something dark that she needs to stop.“Things are waking up.  Old things, dark things.  The old ones who have slept for so very very long.  You set it into motion.  You and that Vulture.”Everyone in the book is battling something in their heads.  Serefin is getting worse every day.  The God inside him is slowly taking over.  Nadya is battling with her feelings for Malachaisz, her new power, and that she had been kept in the dark about a lot of things by the people who loved her.  Malachaisz battles to keep any part of himself.  Parj has a secret she battles with.  So many enemies are working together for different outcomes.  There is a closeness between all of them.  None of them are all good or all bad.  They believe their reasoning is right, even when it tears them up inside.“But things are as simple as good and evil.”  “Are they?”  Nadya thought about the voice, about her dreams filled with monsters.The old Gods were banished and kept secret from Nadya.  They are not content and seek revenge.  Malachaiz is needed for it in some ways.  For Serefin, Velyos needs Serefin to kill Malachaiz.  Nadya needs him to enter into a forest that will likely kill him.  Malachaiz has this power inside of him, begging to come out.  Nothing good can come out of the plans any of them made.“What happens when a monster tries to become a god?”My review is so very random and vague, but I don’t want to ruin the story for anyone.  So much happens.  There is so much blood and death.  The darkness is larger in this one.  Betrayal is definitely a big theme and I had to remember that I couldn’t trust anyone.  And again, we were left with a twist at the end of the book.  I am so sad that I’ll have to wait over a year for the third book, but I know it will be worth the wait.Warnings for cutting, blood magic, war, and death.  Pretty much everything from Wicked Saints.Thank you to the publisher and Netgalley for my earc.  I gave this book 5 stars.

23,"“The King’s Beast” is the sixth book in a series by author Eliot Pattison.  I have not read any other books by this author, so my review reflects whether or not this book is accessible as a stand-alone book.  The subject matter is intriguing enough that I purchased the first book in the series to eventually get the back story on some of the characters in Vol. 6.  As is stands, there are so many characters introduced in “The King’s Beast” that it makes for slow reading at times.  Picture a television show that is story/character driven, and then starting in the middle of the second season.  You would have no idea who is who and who is important to the moving forward of the plot.  Same with this book.  We meet Daniel Boone, for example.  Now is he going to be in the whole story and therefore I need to remember him?  No.  He comes and goes and doesn’t really add anything to the plot.  There are lots of characters like this, along with multiple story lines that branch out.  I am not a reader who sits for hours at a time with a book, and this one was kind of hard to stop and start.Now, that said, I love the premise of intrigue in the time period prior to American independence.  The discovery of ancient mastodon bones in Kentucky really happened in the 1700’s, and the inclusion of that scientific discovery adds zest to the plot.  The hero of the whole series is Duncan McCallum, a Scottish trained physician, Ranger trained fighter, and Deathspeaker to the Indian tribes, who is caught up in the secrecy of the Sons of Liberty, a secret revolutionary group founded to fight the unfair tax laws imposed upon the colonies by Britain.  It is hard to get to “know” Duncan in this novel, which is why I want to read more of the series.  His character doesn’t come across clearly in the beginning, as there are so many other characters being brought forth for consideration.After several deaths occur during the transportation of the mysterious fossil bones, Duncan realizes that there are men plotting to steal the bones at any human cost, and that those men seem to have access to secrets that only the Sons of Liberty should know.  Spurred on by the Shawnee Indians who regard the bones as sacred spirits that must speak to those in power in England, Duncan boards a ship along with the bones and his tribesman friend and fellow warrior, Ishmael.  Finding themselves on the same ship as the men who are trying to steal the bones, they must avoid the Englishmen as well as keep the bones hidden.Upon reaching England, the bones are presented to Benjamin Franklin, who becomes one of the major characters of the story.  His character is nicely written into the plot.  Many more intrigues occur in England, with the bones still being the center of a search, a wise Indian man (who apparently features in all of the books) being hospitalized in the insane asylum known as Bedlam and in need of rescue, and the scientific data regarding the transit of Venus across the sun needing to reach the hands of the King.  Like I said:  lots of characters and lots of plot lines and it felt like they wrapped up too quickly in the last chapter.  The author treats women with great respect, and they occupy roles where they are intelligent and helpful.  The Native Americans are regarded as the keepers of old and sacred ways.  Blacks are independent and creative thinkers.  Relationships are respectful.  Bad guys are really bad.",4,0,3428,0.109,1
24,"Antonia Vega: recently and painfully widowed, recently retired Professor of English, of Dominican descent, the second of four sisters with wildly divergent but equally strong personalities.  While trying to focus on her Afterlife  — “No longer a teacher at the college, no longer volunteering and serving on a half dozen boards, no longer in the thick of the writing whirl — she has withdrawn from every narrative, including the ones she makes up for sale.  Who am I? the plaintive cry.” — she is reluctantly drawn into the here and now.Her eldest sister is behaving erratically and is now missing; a pregnant, illegal, Mexican teenager has shown up at her doorstep and needs help; the local Vermont dairy industry is dependent on illegal labor but with ICE encroaching, her translation and leadership skills are in demand.  People keep expecting her to rise to the occasions, and she really doesn’t want to.The writing is absolutely beautiful, the focus internal.  The book doesn’t follow a typical narrative arc — while all of the plot lines progress, the real story is Antonia — how she copes and how she struggles with decisions:  what is the right thing to do? who is most important? how does she feel about the decisions she is forced to make?  I love that Antonia herself defies stereotype, and in fact, spends a great deal of time considering her own stereotypes — both positive and negative — of herself and those around her.  Examples:“Embodied in a man who could so easily fall into the stereotype where Antonia and friends often banish the Jesus folks, the political right-wingers, the gunslingers and xenophobes.  Her own othering of others.  Whatever is driving him, Sheriff Boyer’s not going to turn off the tide of meanness sweeping over the country, but at least he’s saved a handful of “her” people from being carried away.”“Just because she’s Latina doesn’t automatically confer on her the personality or inclinations of a Mother Teresa.  It irritates her, this moral profiling based on her ethnicity.”Her characters have depth and variability and she explores their personalities in different contexts.  How much personality is expressed or subdued depending on your circumstance?  How is behavior judged externally based on cultural norms for the time and place?  Fascinating and very well done.The writing is wonderful — I feel like I underlined something in every paragraph but here are a few good ones in addition to those above:“Like opera, farm art is an acquired taste.  There she goes again, shoving someone down her othering chute.”“In their small town, it seems everyone wants to tell Antonia their Sam story.  A testament to how much he was respected and loved.  These narratives are a kind of offering — to what god Antonia cannot guess.  All she knows is that for the moment she is its reluctant priestess.”“Her sisters are doing what they always do when they depart a scene, parsing the meat off its bones, analyzing, judging, exclaiming over the different personalities, a kind of sisterhood digestive system.”“Does suffering hurt less if you’re poor?  she asked the room full of young students.  Only the silent dark looks of her two minority students signaled to Professor Vega that they got what she was talking about.”“Call her what you want, Mario says, a snarky insolence in his voice Antonia has never heard before.  It grants her a rare glimpse of who the young man might be in a world where he could be the macho, wielding power.”“Into the vacuum of her considerations he would step with his big, clunky certainties.”",5,0,3561,0.13,0
25,"Please Note:  I received an advance copy of this book from NetGalley in exchange for an honest review.  This did not influence the opinions in my review in any way.In the newly released book, A Hundred Suns, by Karin Tanabe, I got a glimpse of a time and place I knew nothing about,  the Indochine (Vietnam) of the 1930's.  This had much of what I love about historical fiction: vivid descriptions of time and place, and fascinating characters.  While the plot was intentionally lurid at times, and a bit sensational, it was definitely a book I couldn't put down.What I Liked:Setting:We are introduced to two different, but equally fascinating worlds:  Paris in the Jazz Age, and Indochine (Vietnam) in the 1930''s.  In Paris, we see both high society and the vibrant student scene of the time.  While the wealthy were determined to keep staunchly conservative values, university students were in love with the idea of change, particularly with Communism.In Indochine, we also see two different worlds, that of the French colonists, and of the local people who are being oppressed.  The politics of the times were very complex, and I felt the novel did a good job of showing the nuances of this period.Life in the 1920's and 1930's:The book also shows how difficult life was for women at that time.  Most women had few choices.  If they wanted to have a better life, they did so by marrying well.  This limited their choices by forcing many women to accept difficult situations in exchange for security for them and their children.Characters:All of the characters are quite layered, especially Jessie, the main character.  While I had a lot of sympathy for what she was going through, she was no angel.  Her main motivation in life was fear.  And this nudged her to make some awful choices.  Yet I found that she was a fierce mother, and (mostly) loyal wife.Marcelle, Jessie's new friend in Indochine, is also quite complex.  She is in love with a wealthy Indochinese man who she met when he was a student in Paris.  But as her lover Khoi points out, if he weren't ultra-sophisticated (and more French than a Parisian) would she still have fallen in love with him?Both Marcelle and Khoi are sympathetic to Communism, but also enjoy an incredibly privileged life.  They loved the idea of equality but were never for a moment willing to give up their lavish lifestyles.Depiction of Colonialism:I didn't know anything about French Colonialism until I read this book.  I liked that it showed what was so insidious about it, while also showing how the French rationalized it at the time.  The deep racism of the time was so disturbing, but necessary to show how these practices destroyed a beautiful society.What I Was Mixed About:Lurid moments:The book has several moments of debauchery in order to illustrate the wildness of the times.  While I understood this, these scenes were really unpleasant to read about.  I wish that the author would have simply alluded to them, rather than spell them out.  I can't unread them!Plot:The plot is rooted in reality... and then takes on some rediculous twists.  Without giving anything away, I will just say that one character really knows how to pre-plan!  Other plot points were a bit melodramatic.  I wish the book would have stayed with the very real issue of how the French could live with the moral ambiguity of enslaving local people so they could live the High Life.",4,0,3411,0.183,0
26,"Those of us who were adults in the late 20th century remember the Unabomber case.  For years, starting at the end of the 1970s, improvised explosive devices targeted university professors, airlines and tech shops.  Once commonalities established that these were the work of one attacker, the case became known as UNABOM, which stood for UNiversity and Airline BOMber.  Of course, the perpetrator was called the Unabomber.The case took many years, countless agent hours and vast sums of money to crack.  Over time, the Unabomber finally gave the investigators, principally from the FBI, enough evidence to reveal his identity as Ted Kaczynski, a genius who had begun college at 16, progressed to a mathematics Ph.D., taught at Berkeley for a period, but then dropped out and lived in a 10x12 handmade cabin near Lincoln, Montana.  Kaczynski was finally arrested in 1996, pled guilty to multiple charges, including murders, received eight life sentences, and is held at the Supermax prison in Florence, Colorado.Lis Wiehl introduces us to the people on the UNABOM task force and painstakingly details their investigation.  If you remember from the time, the big break in the case came when the Unabomber’s manifesto was published in the Washington Post.  Normally the FBI wouldn’t agree to give a terrorist’s manifesto out for publication, but in this case there were two reasons for the go-ahead: he had promised to stop killing people if it was published, and it was thought that the more people saw the content of the work the more likely it would be that someone would recognize the writing and be able to identify the writer.  And sure enough, it turned out that Ted Kaczynski’s brother recognized his older brother’s voice in the text and contacted the FBI.Wiehl writes that she learned during her research that the recent Discovery channel series about the investigation was misleading, conflating several investigators and giving too much credit to one particular investigator.  Maybe the screenwriters thought viewers would be too confused by a lot of characters.  While there are a lot of them in the book, Wiehl’s writing is lucid and she makes it easy to follow the story.One thing that particularly intrigued me was that quite a few members of the investigative team pooh-poohed the agents who believed that a copy of Kaczynski’s work, compared to the Unabomber manifesto, showed that the authors were one and the same.  At the time, linguistic forensics was not as widely accepted as it is today.  It was novel for the federal judge to grant a search warrant based on linguistic forensics, in the absence (at the time) of physical evidence connecting Kaczynski to the bombs.Because Wiehl’s focus is the investigation, she doesn’t look deeply into Kaczynski’s manifesto, titled Industrial Society and Its Future, with its theme that “[t]he Industrial Revolution and its consequences have been a disaster for the human race.”  He particularly damns technology for damaging the environment and the human psyche, substituting artificial life for natural life.  Many of his points particularly resonate today, and in prison he has the social life he never had before, corresponding with dozens of people regularly.  Why a brilliant man thought that terrorism would help achieve his goals is a mystery—but then that’s true of all terrorism.This is a well-written book that is a good choice for people who enjoy reading about the true crime investigative process.I received a free publisher’s review copy via Netgalley.",4,0,3524,0.091,1
27,"Judging by the title alone, I wasn't sure this would be my kind of book.  I'm a massive horror fan, and I expected this to be just a lighthearted jab at the vampire genre.  In truth, had my own book club not chosen it, I'm not sure I would have picked it up.  I'd heard good things about the author in the past, but never read any of his work, so I didn't really know what to expect.  I have to say, I'm quite pleased.  The author definitely deserves his reputation.Admittedly, this is not a traditional horror novel.  It doesn't have scares all the way through.  It has some good scares balanced with some excellent character building, and more than a little wit.  But I have to say, when Hendrix does write a thrilling scene, he does it right!  This isn't the kind of horror novel that'll make you sleep with your lights on, but it does maintain tension throughout, and when that tension peaks, you'll find yourself white-knuckling your way to the next page in a way very few authors could pull off.  Combined with a plot that's at once original and respectful of vampire tropes in general and you end up with a hell of a book.Unfortunately, there's one significant flaw.  As good horror often does, the book veers occasionally into social commentary.  I'll go into more detail in a ""spoiler"" section below, but suffice it to say that while the social commentary did make for engaging reading in the moment, it was a bit too heavy-handed, and ultimately detracted from one character's realism and slightly marred my enjoyment of the book.  Don't get me wrong, though.  I still loved the book and I still recommend it.  But when compared to the rest of the book, which can only be described as masterful, one of the book's major political themes falls a little flat.Minor spoilers in this paragraph only: The political issue in question has to do with sexism and husband-wife relationships.  In the novel, one of the ways the vampire is successful is by integrating himself into the community.  In particular, he ""corrupts"" the men of the community.  This results in the men being frankly dismissive of their wives' concerns.  Fair enough; that's an interesting subplot.  However, it's taken to extremes when ALL of the men in the book are portrayed as domineering husbands, particularly (but not exclusively) with regards to their wives' suspicions.  Characters thinking their spouses are delusional is interesting, but when it's divided perfectly along gender lines, it begins to feel a little forced.  It's particularly forced in the character of Carter, who starts off seeming like a respectable husband and a respectable psychiatrist and ends up rapidly devolving to the point that he feels like a moustache-twirling villain who behaves poorly toward his wife AND poorly as a psychiatrist.  Clearly, he's meant to be under the influence of the vampire, but he never becomes so corrupted as to lose his mind (a la Renfield) and yet also never seems to struggle at all with his behavior.  Frankly, I don't buy it, and this puts a stain on what I otherwise consider a masterful novel.Despite this single flaw, this remains a great book.  I highly recommend it.  I'm more than happy my book club turned me on to it, and I'll definitely be reading the author's other works.",4,0,3274,0.188,1
28,"The focus of the book description is the 1965 Mossad assassination of Herbert Cukurs, known as the Butcher of Latvia for his brutal organization of and participation in the violent murders of tens of thousands of Latvian Jews.  But there are two other stories here that are at least as interesting as the assassination plot.In 1965, Germany was considering a 20-year statute of limitations that would effectively let all Nazis who participated in the Holocaust walk free if they had not yet been prosecuted.  As was pointed out at the time, that would mean that if the conspiracy theory that Adolf Hitler was not dead proved true, he could not be prosecuted for his role in the murders of millions.  Despite knowing that, and in the face of worldwide condemnation, it appeared until the last moment that the legislature would adopt this limit.  Author Stephan Talty reminds us that this was at a time when nearly all Germans took the position that it was an evil few who were responsible for the Holocaust, and that all other Germans were just as much victims of these few as anybody else.  Thousands of participants in the Holocaust had been prosecuted in the 20 years after the war ended, and they seemed to feel that was enough.  That was particularly the sentiment among the political and judicial elites, who were well aware that many former Nazis were in Germany’s bureaucracy, in the legislature and in the judiciary.The other interesting thread takes up most of the first half of the book.  That is the issue of how native Latvians, who had previously been known for their acceptance of Jews, altered completely as soon as Germany invaded in 1941, driving out their previous Soviet occupiers of the past year or so.  Latvians formed their own battalions and enthusiastically and brutally rounded up Jews and murdered them.  These thugs roamed the streets and broke into homes to terrorize and round up Jews whose families had lived peacefully in Latvia, sometimes for generations.  Talty presents the stories of a few of these, particularly a young woman named Zelma, who was hidden in plain sight by a sympathetic battalion member and who, after the war, worked tirelessly to tell the story of Latvian perpetrators, including Cukurs.Even for someone who has read many WW2 histories, the first half of this book is hard to take.  The descriptions of the horrors undergone by the victims are graphic, and it’s always sickening to see the core of evil that underlies a thin skin of civility in so many people.  Talty describes how Nazi propaganda drove the false narrative that Jews had collaborated with the hated Soviet occupiers.  Herbert Cukurs knew Yiddish and had never been known before the war as an anti-semite.  Talty identifies a possible motivation for his joining the Latvian battalions, though of course it cannot explain his extreme brutality.The stories of Cukurs’s postwar life in Brazil, and the Mossad’s execution plot were interesting, but to me not as thought-provoking as the backdrops.  Talty makes a causal connection between the execution and the dramatic turnabout in the German legislature’s action on the statute of limitations.  I’m not sure if I’m sold on causation, but the story of the statute of limitations issue is a valuable part of this book.",4,0,3285,0.096,1

(Biz Markie is so famous as a DJ that apparently he owns a pair of custom Technics 1200 turntables manufactured with 7 inch platters and known as the 700s. i have seen him in a post on Instagram with these on top of his bed sheets next to his fluffy pillows).I just want you as an aspiring DJ or one who already owns DJ equipment to take the time to read this short but fun and thorough book on the art of the DJ and the business of the DJ.  you won't be disappointed and may learn a few new things even if you are a turntable veteran.",5,0,3069,0.095,0

31,"This book kind was kind of disappointing.  According to the publisher Baker Academic the series in which this book is a part of “provides pastors and pastors-in-training with rich theological reflection on the various seasons that make up a human life, helping them minister with greater wisdom and joy.”  The theological reflection wasn’t as biblical nor as rigorous or practical as I expected.  What’s even more disappointing is the bad theology that is in this book.  In this review I want to talk first about the way the book is organized followed by its strength and then its weakness.The book’s fourteen chapters is grouped into four parts.  Part one is titled “Our Mysterious Beginning” and consists of three chapters.  Part two also consists of three chapters and looks at Jesus’ birth and early life while part three is on the complexity of conception and raising children, having a total of five chapters.  The final portion of the book is on our New Birth and has three chapters, one on adoption one on baptism and the final one titled “You Must be Born Again.”  The book then ends with an epilogue.The best part of the book for me is part one which goes over the marvel of our birth.  Giving credit to where credit’s due the author did his research very well, quoting a broad array of sources from medical books to classical literature.  I was left amaze at the marvel of a child in the womb and I was giving praises to God!  Also the author is quite well read in many areas and with various genres as the footnotes and quotes reveal.  That’s commendable!Yet with such a great beginning in the beginning of the book sadly there’s a lot of theological problem in the book and you even see it in the first chapter.  For instance in chapter one the author James Howell writes “You descended (“in the giant leap forward”) from a group of great apes that existed many thousands of years ago.”  Even Darwinists wouldn’t put it in those language (giant apes?).  He also says we are never closer to God than when we were born; I think that’s not easy to give an exegetical case for that and also downplays the born again Christian experience during conversion.  Also he fawns over the current Roman Catholic pope way too much.The worst chapter in the book is chapter 11.  Titled “When Medicine Fails” it touches on stillbirths and also abortion.  Howell writes “In our day, abortion has—thankfully—been medicalized, and less happily politicized.  In the raging debates between pro-life and pro-choice citizens, and even people of faith, the real stories of real people get lost, and the palpable grief and sorrow go unnoticed.”  In the first sentence of that quote he is talking about the death of a preborn as something to be thankful for.  It is pretty evil for a book on birth to be thanking for a procedure to murder preborns.  In the second sentence he says real stories of people get lost with abortion but the irony escapes him that his statement better describe his own pro-abortion view: indeed “real people get lost” with the politics, especially the preborns that he thinks can be murdered.  Obviously the author thinks abortion is ethical for Christians to support and even be thankful for.  I don’t know if the editor and the author even saw the contradiction of how part one of the book on the wonder of us being alive in the womb condemns the author’s view of abortion.  Given how the book is part of a series for pastors and that a large percentage of the Christian population thinks this is sinful there’s no serious interaction with the arguments and position of the opposing side.  Instead to my disappointment the author in this chapter even commit a straw man fallacy in which he caricature the prolife side as being men lecturing women and men not knowing how women feel.  It is as if he has his head in the sand with contemporary prolife and Christian prolifers including the demographics of its leaders.  So much for this being a book that is a part of a series that’s supposed to give “rich theological reflection.”  Even in talking about the guilt and shame of women who committed abortion the author doesn’t bring in Christ and the Gospel for hope for these women and it strikes me as pastoral malpractice.The book also have a bad view of Scripture; that is, it has a view of Scripture that is not consistent with Scripture’s view of itself.  Howell think the authors of Scriptures were “unable to picture anything from God, they assumed infertility was from god, that God tossed down thunderbolts, that God willed slaughter on the battlefield” and this record nothing more than what they thought God was doing, not actually what God was doing.  The author goes so far as to say “The Bible has inflicted much harm when it comes to infertility” (yes, that’s an actual quote).  He talks about how Christians give bad comfort for those who lost a child and one of the ways the author pastorally prepare those who lost a child is he gives a photocopy of a napkin to make the point that the advice they will hear Christians give to them are woefully inadequate.  Ironically that’s what the book in this chapter does, while undermining the Scripture itself that would be the source of comfort and consolation.  With such a low view of Scripture no wonder this work doesn’t really handle the Scriptures and the author quotes everybody under the sun more than he quoted the Bible or handle it in a deeper meaningful yet practical way.I don’t think I can recommend this book.  I hope other volumes in this series doesn’t disappoint like this one did.  I realize my review can be seen as harsh by some readers but the history of my reviews of books from Baker Academic has largely been positive and there are a lot of books I enjoyed from the publisher.  It’s just this one isn’t one of them and it didn’t meet the expectation I have come to enjoy from them over the years.NOTE: This book was provided to me free by Baker Academic and Net Galley without any obligation for a positive review.

32,"Temper is book three in the Knights of Fury series by Chantal Fernando.  This is my very first book by Chantal.  This is a MC, age gap romance.  It can easily be read as a stand alone even though it’s part of a series.  I have not read any of the previous books and had no difficulty at all.  I first noticed the cover of this book which made me take a second look.  But what really drew me in was the blurb.  I was definitely intrigued and am so glad I decided to take a chance on this.Abigail (Abbie) Redmond is twenty eight years old, lives with her mom and younger sister, and works at their family owned bar, Franks.  Abbie had to drop out of college and put her own dreams on hold due to her mother’s health issues.Abbie first met the swoony biker five years ago the first time he came into her bar.  Over the years, he shows up a couple of times a year, stays for a drink, and always asks her out.  She always says no.  It’s obvious he’s older than her but more than that, going out with a biker is definitely not a good idea.  That’s what her mother keeps telling her anyway.  But this time when he comes in, she wants to say yes.  She’s tired of being cautious.  She’s attracted to him and he to her.  It’s one night, one date.  What could go wrong?!Temper is forty two years old and is president of the Knights of Fury MC just outside of Los Angeles.  He’s been trying to convince Abbie to go out with him for five years.  Tonight is finally his big chance.  So he plans the perfect date.  Only things don’t quite end the way he might have hoped.  They end with Abbie thrown into the back seat of the car and racing back to LA to his home.“Being fearful of life is only barely living, and sometimes the gamble is worth it.”The reason for going to LA might have been unpleasant, but once she’s there, away from her stifling, overbearing mom, Abbie starts to gain confidence.  She was like a bird spreading her wings and learning to fly.  That spark that had been between she and Temper from the first time they met, grew into so much more.  Temper, the feared president of a MC club was a caring, sweet, attentive man to her.  He was everything she could have wanted.“Taking a chance on Temper is the best thing I ever did.”Not only does their feelings grow for each other, Abbie feels like she fits in here, she makes friends, she feels needed, she feels stronger.  But Abbie and Temper and the rest of the club are in for a few surprises.  I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised with all the little twists and turns this took.  I might have even “gasped” a time or two!This was such an enjoyable read.  I do enjoy MC romance but haven’t read all that many.  Some of the ones I have read, though, are dark.  This wasn’t.  I loved seeing Temper’s soft side, and Abbie was the perfect match for him.  This was sweet, sexy, and a bit suspenseful.  I’m so glad I decided to read this.",4,0,2897,0.204,1
33,"If Chantal Fernando isn't on your auto-buy list yet, she should be.  I have yet to read a book by her that is not thoroughly enjoyable, and in fact, not a single book of hers has been given 4 stars in my book.  Every single one has been a solid 5 stars.  What I love most about her depiction of the MC world is that she makes it realistic and doesn't overdo it.  Other books in this genre always seem to lend towards the sex and not enough towards the relationship.  While the world is very sexualized and obviously has women followers all over the ""bad boys"" within the group, there is a need for some heart to be added to the mix, and Chantal does just that.  The heroes are Alpha, but they are also soft when they need to be.  Their women make them that way, and it's a good thing.Temper has been asking out Abbie out every year for the last five years, each time he visits her family's bar on his way to the Nevada chapter of the Knights of Fury MC.  And each year she politely turns him down.  She has very little relationship experience, not to mention that Temper is quite a bit older than her, and he's part of a motorcycle gang.  Doesn't seem like a good mix.  But after realizing she doesn't have much of a life and really wants one, she says yes.  Which leads to a seriously romantic, toe-curling date, followed by a body in the street and Abbie tied up in the back of a car.  They say it's to keep her safe, but Abbie doesn't truly know Temper.  He could be her saving grace...or he could be the devil in disguise.Obviously, with a cover like that, you know Temper is hot.  But my God, after reading about him, I am starting to rethink the age limit on my dating apps.  Abbie is 28 and Temper is 42.  Not a small age gap, but it's not so overly large as to be too crazy.  However, it's super intimidating to Abbie, given that she's only ever had one partner before, and very little dating since then.  Temper seems to be way out of her league.  Thankfully, while Temper is the President of the MC and therefore someone who attracts lots of women, he's only had his eyes on one woman in recent years - Abbie.  They are absolutely adorable together.  And I freaking LOVE Abbie.  She didn't let Temper forget when she was mad at him, and she made sure he knew that she wouldn't forgive so easily.  I hate when heroines let the heroes off too easy, and Abbie gave him just the right set-down without being annoying.  Temper took it like a man, groveled a bit, and then eventually they became one of the sexiest dang couples I have read in a long while.  But what can I expect from a Chantal Fernando book?  Every man she writes about is my next book boyfriend.  Every one.As always, can't wait to read what she writes next.  Can she top this one?

I've had a fondness for Madeline Hunter's work for years and, although that fondness has lessened over the years, I like to give her the benefit of the doubt when she begins a new series.  So...this isn't a bad read.  Although done before in various manifestations, the plot held my interest.I've read HRs with private investigators, even female private investigators and I've also read HRs about women receiving windfall inheritances, but Hunter always manages to stay within the norms of 1800s England fairly well.  If she has enterprising women characters in her books, they are not as anachronistically annoying as those created by other HR authors with feminist themes.The inevitable, ubiquitous, young, handsome HR duke is present here but he is not the hero in this first book of the series.  (But you can bet he'll be the star of one book of this trilogy.)  No, our hero here is cousin to that duke, an ex-soldier with some kind of secret in his past which we will eventually find out about, who, although independently wealthy somehow or other, works as an inquiry agent or private investigator.At the moment our hero, Chase Radnor, is working, trying to find three mysterious women to whom his uncle, the late duke, left hefty inheritances.  Since the duke died in mysterious circumstances, that also figures into Chase's investigations.And then there's our heroine Minerva Hepplewhite.  She's the only one of the three heiresses Chase has located so far.  Minerva has secrets in her past also.  In the first place, perhaps Minerva Hepplewhite isn't even her real name and she may have a past she wants no one know about.Since Minerva's connection to the late duke is such an unknown (she claims never to have met the man) even though she is receiving a sizable amount of money in his will, naturally Chase is suspicious that she may have had something to do with his death.  Aha.  Let the story begin.As he investigates, Chase begins to admire Minerva's poise and self-reliance (and beauty).  When she begins her own investigations in order to clear herself of the crime, it's inevitable that they will eventually work together, even though they will remain a bit suspicious of each other.  BTW, it must be noted that Minerva has been dabbling in private investigation work of her own for a few years.  Who would have thunk?  A P.I.-P.I. romance.There are lots of relatives of the late duke and other secondaries to be suspicious of.  So we have a romance cum whodunit.  The romance here comes to a satisfactory HEA.  The mystery does not quite, so readers who feel the need for closure there will have to continue with the trilogy.  And, of course, readers who want romance for the hero's two cousins, a duke and an entrepreneur of sorts, will need to read the next two books for that also.This is a pleasant read.  I enjoyed it but nothing about it felt particularly special.  Just a typical Hunter HR.  She writes well and isn't especially anachronistic, so I'm not sorry to have read this and will probably read the whole trilogy.",3,2,3081,0.135,1
35,"Beyond the Ghetto Gates is an amazing novel of religious and cultural conflict set during Napoleon's Italian campaign of 1796-1797.  The protagonist, Mirelle, is a young Jewish woman living in the ghetto of Ancona, Italy, where the Jews live in narrow, cramped streets and are locked behind the ghetto gates at night.  When they venture out into Christian Ancona, they are forced to wear yellow kerchiefs and armbands.  Mirelle's father runs a workshop which designs ketubot, Jewish marriage certificates.  His ketubot are beautifully made and renowned throughout Europe.  Mirelle, with her mathematical mind, keeps the accounts for her father and wants to spend her life working in his ketubot workshop.  But the rabbi forbids her, as a woman, from working there.  Her mother wants her to marry the wealthy David Morpurgo, her friend Dolce's father, a man older than her own father.  The marriage would secure her and her family's future.  But will it make her happy?Then Napoleon's troops invade Italy, and everything changes.  They tear down the ghetto gates, and the Jews are allowed to go about freely in Ancona, without having to wear distinctive clothing.  But tensions rise between Jews and Christians.  Francesca, a devout Catholic, and her daughter Barbara discover a supposedly miraculous portrait of the Madonna, which appears to weep and smile.  The portrait gains a following among Ancona's Catholics, and it has a special meaning to Napoleon.  Francesca is married to the abusive and rabidly anti-Semitic Emilio.  Her husband's cruelty and increasingly violent behavior disturb her, but her faith tells her to be true to her marriage vows.Among Napoleon's troops are two young soldiers, Mirelle's cousin Daniel and his Catholic friend Christophe.  Mirelle and Christophe meet for the first time at a masked ball in Venice and are instantly attracted to each other.  The attraction grows when Christophe and Daniel come to Ancona.  Mirelle has to decide between her love for the handsome Christophe and her duty to her family and faith.  Will she honor her family's wishes and marry David Morpurgo, or will she follow her heart?  If she married a Christian, she would be considered dead to her family, so she faces a very painful choice.Cameron illustrates Jewish life in Ancona brilliantly.  The Napoleonic era is a favorite of mine, but until now I had not read a novel set in this era that was written from a Jewish perspective, and I found Cameron's novel fascinating because of this point of view.  The conflicts between Jews and Christians are portrayed very well.  I also enjoyed the scenes between Francesca and Daniel, where a friendship grows between them, but Francesca cannot entirely let go of her prejudices against Jews--prejudices she has learned from a very early age.Mirelle is a wonderful heroine.  She is intelligent and strong, but does not seem like a modern woman placed within the pages of a historical novel.  Her sense of duty to family and faith is a strong part of her character, and she is conflicted over whether she loves Christophe enough to risk losing all she has.  I hope we will see her again in a future novel.",5,0,3161,0.221,0

37,"Ahoy there mateys!  One of the things I have come to appreciate about Nancy Kress’ work is that it always be thought provoking.  The concepts are interesting and led to some fun conversations with me First Mate.  As a conversation starter, I really enjoyed it.  As an entertainment it wasn’t so effective.Though the title is sea change, the real issue behind this novella is GMO crops.  The story postulates what would happen if a GMO pharmaceutical product caused child deaths and the response from the world was to ban all GMO products.  This choice seemed odd because the product was a drug and not a food.  Yet the focus of the GMO fight is bringing back GMO crops to handle the food shortages caused by climate change of weather patterns.The book felt like the author was trying to bash ye over the head with how GMO crops are necessary.  Part of the issue is because there is an underground resistance trying to engineer them.  The main character, Renata, is a member of this organization.  And I didn’t like her.  She was abrasive, kinda naive, and fanatical.  As a crusader, she seemed to latch onto her causes with no real discernment.  She doesn’t know what the end goal of her organization is, how it is really structured, or who is involved.  Safety first, supposedly.  Sure they are trying to create new cultivars but beyond that, what?  I would want to know the big picture.  Renata just wants to believe that she is participating in a good cause and feel better.  I sympathized a bit but still thought she was ridiculous.The story also had a problem because of the mix of science diatribe and interpersonal drama.  There is a subplot dealing with her ex-husband that wasn’t poorly written but could  have been removed all together.  The past and present are showcased in alternating timelines.  I think the story would have been much more powerful taking place only in the present.  That said, I actually liked the past sections better and they held me attention more satisfactorily.The present sections left too many unanswered questions.  For example there be a self-driving house.  Why?  Only one color of paint left.  Why?  How is the food system run now?  How do the poor live?  How is the economy actually structured after the Catastrophe?  In the other books I have read by the author, it seemed as though Kress had really delved into the ramifications of changes to society across the board.While I thought the writing itself wasn’t bad, the plot did not work for me.  I ended up not caring about any of the characters or the plot itself.  It just left me confused overall and unsatisfied.  Maybe this would have worked better as a longer novel but I have to admit that I don’t want to particularly hear anymore GMO soapboxing regardless of me underlying interest in the topic.  Still enjoyed some of the intellectual ideas and projections but not enough to reread this book or necessarily recommend it.I received a copy from the publisher in exchange for me honest musings.

38,"The Stolen Letter by Paige Shelton has Delaney Nichols heading back to work after her honeymoon with her new husband, Tom.  As she heads towards The Cracked Spine, Delaney runs into a woman carrying a large number of books.  After helping retrieve the volumes, Delaney introduces herself to Mary who looks remarkably like her.  Delaney is to learn from Mary Stewart that they both look like Mary, Queen of Scots, and Mary states that she was the Queen of Scots in a past life.  Mary then invites Delaney, Tom and Rosie to dinner that evening.  Rosie has surprising news to share with Delaney once they are alone.  It seems The Cracked Spine has not passed an inspection and the Edinburgh city council will be voting in a week to shut down their beloved bookstore.  The next morning, they hear a BOOM and learn that Henry Stewart, Mary’s husband and a member of the city council, died in a car explosion.  Delaney is astonished when she discovers that Henry was the one pushing for the vote to close The Cracked Spine.  Something does not add up and Delaney intends to get answers so she can save the bookshop.  The Stolen Letter is the fifth novel in A Scottish Bookshop Mystery series.  It can be read alone for those new to this series.  I was eager to read The Stolen Letter when I saw it involved Mary, Queen of Scots.  She is one of my favorite historical figures along with Queen Elizabeth I.  Delaney Nichols enjoyed her honeymoon with her new hubby, Tom Shannon, but she is eager to return to The Cracked Spine.  Delaney loves her job and the people who work there.  When Delaney hears that her beloved bookstore is in jeopardy, she takes action.  Delaney is fierce when it comes to The Cracked Spine.  I felt Edwin should play a bigger role (it is his shop) and I was happy to see that Edwin stepped up when it counted.  Rosie, a shop employee, is a delight.  I liked how she was involved in the investigation.  I enjoyed the author’s word imagery which brings the book to life.  I could envision Edinburgh with its charming shops, cobbled streets and cozy pubs.  The mystery is complex with its suspicious suspects, misdirection and various clues.  I just love a twisty whodunit.  I bet you will be surprised when the solution is revealed.  I found The Stolen Letter to be well-written with genuine, friendly characters.  I could tell the author did her research on Mary, Queen of Scots.  There were some details that were new to me.  It was also interesting to learn about Burgess Tickets and the Freedom Casket they came in.  The ending was wonderful.  It was unique and surprising.  The Stolen Letter is a great addition to A Scottish Bookshop Mystery series.  The Stolen Letter is an entertaining cozy mystery with a perplexing puzzle, an insidious inspection, a remarkable reincarnation, a crafty councilor, lost links, and a determined Delaney.*I voluntarily read an advanced copy of this book.

39,"Newly elected Sheriff Sunshine Vicram rolls back into Del Sol, New Mexico with her fourteen year old daughter Auri and a suitcase full of bad memories and karma.  She'd left this whimsical little town in her rearview at age seventeen - running from a traumatic, life-altering experience and a broken heart with no intention of ever returning to the scene of the crime.  And yet, here she is having won an election she didn't enter.  Is that even legal?  One's thing for sure, the most action this place ever sees is from resident flasher Doug, an escape artist rooster called Puff Daddy, or a group of eccentric old ladies called The Book Babes.  Piece of cake, right? lol  Think again.  On Sunshine's first day on the job, all hell breaks loose when a girl is reported missing and an escaped convict is spotted around the outskirts of town.  Sunshine and Deputy Quincy Cooper, a childhood friend, begin their investigation and, of course, one of the first people they need to interview is Sunshine's ole flame Levi Ravinder . . . one of THE Ravinders.  And no surprise that nothing's changed between them as sparks, flames, and ugly, hurtful words fly.  What is his problem?!  Buckle up y'all - you're in for one hell of a ride!A Bad Day For Sunshine is told through two points of view - that of Sunshine and her daughter Auri.  The results are alternating chapters and intertwining dual plotlines that will keep readers on their toes.  Auri is faced with her own drama from being bullied at school plus she's a wanna-be sleuth with a tendency to jump in the deep in without a backup plan.  Strangely enough, it's often Levi that rides in on a white horse to rescue her.  Yes, there's a story there too.Multiple plot lines and muti-dimensional characters help set a fast pace in A Bad Day For Sunshine.  It's an entertaining read with lots of witty banter, quirky characters, and one-liners.  I will say that all the snark had me concerned early on as it was spread a bit thick.  I found myself searching for the plot line and thinking is this all there is?  No need for concern as the story soon settles in, and I quickly became immersed in hunting for clues to the kidnapper's identity and a link I felt I was missing.  Character-driven stories such as this one with a star support cast generating a great deal of suspense are among my favorites.  Jones trademark wit is evident throughout creating laugh out loud scenes even in the midst of a kidnapping investigation.  I did feel at times as though the urgency of the case was sacrificed to the humor as main characters meandered off course frequently, but in her usual magical manner this author makes it work.  There's an overall story arc that obviously continues into the next book, and I'm looking forward to seeing where it leads these characters and readers.` All in all, A Bad Day For Sunshine is a great start to a fascinating new series by the beloved Darynda Jones.  Highly Recommended!",4,0,2952,0.125,0
40,"So long as Dana Simpson keeps publishing the ""Phoebe and Her Unicorn"" books, I'm going to keep reading them.  They're a delightful series, and remind me of one of my favorite comic strips of all time, Bill Watterson's ""Calvin and Hobbes.""  And ""Camping with Unicorns"" is full of the same fun and delightful adventures... and the added bonus of giving us some character development as the series has progressed.Summer vacation has started, and Phoebe has a feeling this isn't going to be an ordinary summer, even by her standards.  And she's right -- her rival and ""frenemy,"" Dakota, actually wants to try to befriend her this summer!  Can Phoebe master the art of being sorta cool so as not to embarrass Dakota in front of her other friends?  And what will happen when her family and Max's family go camping together and run into a gamer unicorn in the forest?  Or when Todd the Candy Dragon gets tired of being treated like a living candy dispenser?  Find out all this and more in this volume.Dana Simpson's artwork is delightful as always, reminiscent of ""Calvin and Hobbes"" but with its own unique style.  It features clean artwork and a sleek yet adorable art style.  Also, I appreciate that Simpson makes an effort to give every character unique features and to change up their clothing every so often -- just look at ""Peanuts"" or ""Calvin and Hobbes"" and notice how a lot of the characters look alike and never seem to own more than one change of clothes...  The panel layout is fairly simple, but given that this is a compilation of newspaper strips, that's understandable.Being adapted from a newspaper comic, stories are fairly episodic and divided into four-panel gags (save the longer Sunday strips).  But Simpson still manages to carry on story arcs and even manage some character development along the way.  It's actually rather satisfying to see Dakota evolve as a character instead of being a stock villain for the series, and it's nice seeing how Phoebe and Marigold have evolved as well.  Sure, their basic character traits have remained the same, but their friendship has developed by this point and they've had time to adapt to each others' weirdness... though that doesn't necessarily mean the reader knows what to expect all the time from a friendship between a little girl and a unicorn.On a side note... do I detect just a little bit of shade thrown at the ""Calvin and Hobbes"" comic strips during the camping-trip arc?  Or is that just me?  It's not an insulting or disrespectful jab, but it's amusing all the same to see Phoebe and her father discuss the real meaning behind the term ""it builds character,"" a phrase that frequently came up in ""Calvin and Hobbes"" (especially during that strip's camping-trip arcs).""Phoebe and Her Unicorn"" ranks among my favorite comic strips of all time, not far behind ""Calvin and Hobbes"" and ""The Far Side.""  And ""Camping With Unicorns"" is a delightful continuation of the series.  Great not just for kids, but for adults and fans of Bill Watterson's work.",5,0,3015,0.142,0
41,"Gone With the Rogue is the second book in Amelia Grey's First Comes Love series.  I absolutely loved the first book and was excited to get a chance to read Julia's story.  Though I enjoyed it, it just didn't grab me like the first installment.  I adored the hero, but for some reason I just couldn't warm up to Julia.  But it was still worth reading and an enjoyable way to pass the time.Widow Julia Fairbright was stuck in a tree in the park, caught by her collar when she attempted to retrieve her son's butterfly net from said tree.  She attempted to remain hidden while her son's nanny ran to retrieve scissors to cut Julia loose; it just wouldn't do if her father-in-law the Duke found out that she wasn't behaving like the perfect widow out in public!  However, Garrett Stockton, the owner of a successful shipping company, spied her in the tree and climbed up to help her.  He was immediately smitten by the beautiful young woman, and Julia was drawn to him as well.  She had to fight that attraction, nonetheless; Julia would lose her son to the Duke if she didn't behave with proper decorum or if she tried to take her son with her to live independently.  She had a plan to set herself free, though, and when Garrett called on her at her home with the excuse of telling her he was having the butterfly net fixed, she thought perhaps the handsome rogue might be willing to assist in her plans...Julia lost her husband at sea.  Though she didn't love him, they had an agreeable marriage which resulted in the birth of a son.  She, along with two friends, turned a home into a boarding house and school for female family members of men who died at sea.  All Julia wanted was to escape the Duke's rule and live independently with her son.  Garrett was usually away traveling for his work and had come home to buy his childhood home before he took off again.  His attraction to Julia, however, had him rethinking his entire life's plans.  I loved how this so-called rogue didn't fight his feelings for this woman and her young son; he was willing to do everything in his power to help set her free.  There was something in the way Julia treated him that I just couldn't put my finger on but that I didn't care for.  Their connection was real, however, and quite steamy when they gave in to passion.  I also loved a scene where Julia and her friend Brina were attempting to bake bread and make soup, never mind barely having stepped into a kitchen before.  It made me think of Lucy Ricardo and Ethel and made me smile.  I am really looking forward to Brina's story, she being the only one of the three women who actually loved the husband she lost.I received an ARC of this book courtesy of the publisher and NetGalley.

42,"Peter Rathbone, Duke of Compton, is still reeling from his younger sister Delia’s tragic death and barely scraping by financially, trying to salvage the ducal lands with nearly no income.  He has nothing to lose, so when his late sister’s friends descend upon him unannounced, he has no choice but to host them in an impromptu house party that could change everything for him.Miss Ada Grandison is haunted by dreams of her late friend and hopes a visit to her home, and her handsome brother, will help her overcome her grief.  As Peter, Ada, and her friends try to parse meaning from the cryptic note Delia left behind, Peter finds himself increasingly skeptical and afraid to hope for a change in his circumstances, especially when his burgeoning feelings for Ada make him long for that change more than ever before.This was an ok book for me, but I wouldn’t precisely call it entertaining.  I was intrigued by the premise, but it seemed nothing really happened for much of the book.  I was rather bored for much of it and it started to feel like I was reading the same scenes over and over with Peter being awkward, but rather adorable, if cynical, and Ada being a bit vapid and immature, but also admirably determined.  I really didn’t enjoy the girl group shenanigans we got here; Ada and her friends just seemed rather immature much of the time and very rude to Peter.  Despite his reduced circumstances, he was still a duke and their host and deserved better treatment.  To that end, while his loneliness and cluelessness made him charming, Peter was also a bit too much of a beta hero and I wanted him to stand up for himself a bit more.There was very little in the way of romance here.  In fact, I think there were more scenes featuring Ada and her friends than there were between Ada and Peter.  This combined with an utter lack of steam, not to mention the abject loneliness of Peter’s situation and the immaturity demonstrated by both himself and Ada, made this seem like a fleeting sort of puppy love more so than a lasting relationship with a true foundation.  The mystery aspect here started out intriguing, but it just fizzled out and there was no romantic chemistry to keep things going either.  Ada never tried to understand Peter or his worries, she was just determined to have her own way and it fortunately worked out, but there was never any real relationship development or attempts to get to know one another.  This combined with the extremely slow pacing had me losing interest rapidly.  There was a good set up for this to be a solid, gothic themed novel and it just didn’t pan out.  The most compelling characters here were Aunt Julia and the Earl of Macklin so I may read the next book for them, but I’m not sure at this point.I voluntarily read and reviewed an advanced copy of this book.

43,"When it comes to health and nutrition I have read many books on the topic and am pretty well versed in what it takes for a good alkaline result in the body.  Let's see how this book measures up for me.WHAT IS THIS BOOK LIKE?This book is about resetting the body using alkaline producing foods in the body.  This is a topic that I enjoy and have done a lot of experimentation with and research.  The information in this book is nice, not WOW.  The layout just is not great for me.  It seems to take too much time to sit and read and wade through to get what I need to know out of it.  I did read through it, but I did not enjoy it.The information is good for the most part, but I am not finding it as easy to get through as I have in other layouts.WHAT IS WRONG WITH THE LAYOUT?When it comes to following a complex book like this, most people need the bottom line.  They want it laid out nicely, as in, you open the book, and you read what you have to do for today.  All of the cause and effect information when in bite sized pieces can be inserted in the daily info, but for the most part it needs to be broken down into parts that are easy to open, read, and shut.  For some reason this book just falls short in that department.VISUALLY DIFFICULT TO GET THROUGHI am not sure if the final copy of this book will have photos or if the layout plans are going to change, but as they are, there are no visual markers to help me find where I want to go quickly and then look at the information, and move on.  There are no photos in here, and the layout is okay, but I just find it overwhelming when I need to refer to it quickly.RECIPESAgain, for this topic, the information is okay, but I find that the ingredients in the recipes are not even that inspiring.  Some of them I have found to give problems to some people, especially if they are dealing with fungal problems due to oats and legumes for example.  I am just not overjoyed with some of the recipes.  It is a lot of work to have to substitute ingredients as well which I would have to do for this recipe plan.THE BOTTOM LINEI was excited to read this, but that excitement waned as I moved through the book.  Layout was not easy for me to get through and some of the information is just not in line with what I have found to be better for me and others I know on the same topic.  It is okay to read through, but for me, it just is not in line with my approach to alkaline cleanse/lifestyle.MY RATINGThree stars.  It is okay, and perhaps some people would do better with it than me, but for my own reaction, I just am not feeling this book, despite my familiarity with and enjoyment of the topic.",3,0,2649,0.128,1
44,"Detective Paul Czarcik of the Illinois Bureau of Judicial Enforcement is a man of many vices.  He is investigating the gruesome torture killings of two Chicagoans, Luis and Marisol Fernandez.  The married couple had been found guilty of abusing their three foster children.  Czarcik enters crime scene data into the Integrated Database Aggregator (IDA) and discovers similarities between his case and the murder of Judge Jeral Robertson in Dallas, Texas.  The judge severely beat his disabled daughter, Jenny, with his belt.  A video of the beating went viral on social media.  Daniel Langdon, a vigilante, attempts to blackmail Czarcik into ceasing his investigation.  However, Czarcik is relentless in pursuing Daniel across the country.  The cop remains one step behind the vigilante, unable to prevent his bloody crusade to kill everyone on his death list.  Don't worry; unless you are a child molester, Daniel Langdon won't harm you.  Thomas Holgate's ""Rain Will Come"" is one of the most awesome, most entertaining vigilante thrillers I have ever read.  Holgate is a screenwriter; he should definitely turn his debut novel into a film.  I grew up watching vigilante films and reading paperback horror novels.  Holgate pays tribute to Stephen King and the Charles Bronson ""Death Wish"" franchise.  (Please read my review for Jason Pinter's superb mystery, ""Hide Away,"" for more discussion on my predilection for vigilante novels and films.)  Holgate is definitely a man after my own heart.  Reading his novel reminded me so very much of the ""Saw"" film franchise in which a terminally ill Dr. John Kramer is exacting vengeance against criminals; he forces them to race against the clock while attempting to free themselves from torturous ""tests.""  Failure always results in death.  Daniel is also terminally ill; however, he has no desire to free his prisoners.  They must all die!  Yes, throughout the novel, I rooted and cheered for Daniel.  I loved how he stalked his prey and mercilessly killed them in gruesome methods.  There is decapitation, castration, and anal penetration.  This novel is not for the squeamish.  I warn you.  There is lots of blood and gore.  Paul Kersey of the ""Death Wish"" films would have simply shot his victims in the center of their foreheads and be done with it.  Daniel likes to slowly torture his victims.  Most readers would agree that his victims deserved to die.  They are child molesters, pedophiles, and pederasts.  (The last term was a new one on me; I'll let you look that one up for yourself.)  Some of them beat and raped their own children.  I must admit that the pedophile Catholic priest, Father Andrew Dyer, was a bit cliched.  Haven't we read enough about priests?  How about a boy scout leader next time?  I kept hoping and praying that Detective Paul Czarcik (pronounced Tsar-sick) would never bring Daniel to justice.  Initially, I assumed that Czarcik is the novel's requisite hero and Daniel is the villain.  However, Czarcik is a cop with a lot of vices.  He drinks too much, snorts too much cocaine, solicits prostitutes, and steals from crime scenes.  (He pilfered a knife from a crime scene.)  Readers will later learn that this man is no better than Daniel.  If it was me, I would've stopped pursuing Daniel.  However, Czarcik, who is a loser at everything in life except being a cop, can't terminate the pursuit.  In my eyes, he became the villain and Daniel became the hero.  ""Antihero"" is probably a more appropriate term for Daniel Langdom.  Before he was diagnosed with an incurable brain tumor (Grade 4 glioblastoma), he was a highly successful engineer.  Instead of spending his last days feeling sorry for himself, he decided to become a crusader who is hellbent on ridding the earth of those who abuse innocent children.  These criminals are unrepentant; they are repeat offenders who display no remorse.  Indeed, they often blame the victims.  A perfect example of an antihero is the vampire Barnabas Collins of the gothic soap opera, ""Dark Shadows.""  As time passed, the popularity of this evil, villainous character grew until the show's producers could not kill him.  Despite his constant craving for blood, Barnabas evolved into a character that was always rescuing the Collins family from tragedy.  Rude and obnoxious, Paul Czarcik reminds me of the controversial comedian, Andrew Dice Clay.  Czarcik sometimes made me laugh out loud.  He curses reporters and flips off other drivers.  His behavior can sometimes be shocking.  On the other hand, Daniel is a benevolent, soft spoken, handsome gentleman.  His only vice is the enjoyment of torturing those who abuse and molest innocent children.  It was fun watching the two men battle each other, verbally and physically, across the country.  For poor Daniel, time is running out.  Will he be able to complete his mission before the tumor kills him or before Czarcik kills him?  This novel made me think about how I would spend my last days if I was diagnosed with a terminal illness.  For all of us, time is running out.  Some of us, however, have a better idea of when death is coming.  Let me repeat that Thomas Holgate's ""Rain Will Come"" is intended for mature readers.  It has plenty of sex, violence, and drug usage.  It also has a very high body count, which I loved.  There is a tremendous amount of blood and guts to satisfy the sweet tooth of every gore hound.  There are some shocks and twists.  No matter how comfortable my recliner, couch, or bed was, I never became sleepy while reading this one.  There was simply too much excitement.  However, don't expect a deep, complex mystery.  Readers soon learn the serial killer's identity and motive.  There is one revelation that is meant to be quite shocking but I had already anticipated it.  Overall, Holgate's ""Rain Will Come"" is a fun rollercoaster ride through hell on earth.  Like most amusement rides, it ended too fast.  Now, all I can do is wait and hope that the rain will come, again.",5,0,5980,0.107,0
45,"Nearly fifty years ago, I found a copy of Michael Harrington's ""Socialism"" on a paperback rack at a local convenience store.  It proved to be one of the most influential reads of my life.  Harrington was then the most prominent socialist intellectual in the U.S., famous for his book, ""The Other America,"" which influenced LBJ's war on poverty.  This book is in a similar vein and an essential updating of the history of socialism and its relevance for this country.  Bhaskar Sunkara is the twenty-something editor of Jacobin magazine.  He writes with an insight and depth that far surpasses his years.  He has a playful wit that entertains the reader as well.In this book, you'll get a sophisticated analysis of the basic teachings of Marx and Engels that serves as a welcome corrective to distorted and dishonest treatments of Marxism from both conservatives and Communists.  Sunkara is excellent in coverage of the debates that roiled Germany's Social Democratic party in the early years of the last century and that forecast fault lines on the radical left for decades to come.  My own favorite chapter is the one that covers Sweden's Social Democrats, who by the 1970s had created what the author terms ""the most livable society in history.""  And while the Swedes never succeeded in supplanting capitalism, they and other European social democrats instituted egalitarian, humane policies in areas like education and health care that we are still nowhere close to realizing in this country.Sunkara is weaker on the perennial question of ""Why No Socialism in the United States?""  The failure of the movement on these shores was not so much a product of government repression, flawed leadership strategies, and structural barriers such as the two-party system as the author contends.  Instead, the German writer, Werner Sombart, was more correct when he argued in 1906 that American socialism had ""foundered upon shoals of roast beef and apple pie.""  American material abundance under capitalism along with the pervasive ideology of free markets and rampant individualism kept socialism here fundamentally weak, even during its glory days under the leadership of Eugene Victor Debs.  And the role of racism and xenophobia in dividing the working class and fostering a politics of resentment was decisive as well, a fact increasingly evident since the election of 2016.What runs through this excellent book is the confidence that we can do so much better.  The climate change crisis,the injustices that accompany the current pandemic, and the emergence of a new generation unburdened by Cold War baggage and so much more enlightened than prior ones on questions of gender and race has suddenly put the kind of democratic socialism espoused by Sunkara on the American agenda.  When the great socialist, George Orwell, was asked what he was fighting for in the Spanish Civil War, he replied ""common decency.""  Bhaskar Sunkara has written ""The Socialist Manifesto"" in the service of that same essential cause.",5,0,3007,0.128,1
46,"When I saw the premise of this book, that Jesus Christ had a wife, I was quite intrigued to read it.  My one hesitation was that this might feel like work to read.  I demand from my reading experience to provide an interlude of escape and relaxation.  I don't like to ""get into the weeds"" when I read.  On the religious front, I am a believer.  But back in the early eighties I purchased ""The Reader's Digest Bible"" and found that it was the only palatable version I could withstand reading.  I needn't have worried about this tome.  Ten percent into this I was already enchanted.This is a work of historical fiction narrated by Ana, the wife of Jesus.  As the book begins, she is fourteen.  She is not following the accepted role of a young woman in her time.  She has great aspirations and longings.  Her passion is writing.  She feels a sense of destiny that she will do something important with this gift and will be undeterred in realizing this goal.  Her father has grudgingly provided tutors so Ana can perfect her writing skills and learn different languages.  He has also kept Ana supplied with parchment and material to make inks.  She has already documented important stories of females that she knows, since no one seems to write about them.  Ana considers her handiwork of these scrolls her most valuable possession.At this time in history, a woman's role was decided by her parents and involved being a pawn in arranged marriages.  A contract would be prepared for the marriage that was advantageous for the parents.  Ana's parents had no intention of her prioritizing a writing career of any sort, and they would decide who she would marry.  Love was not even a consideration.Ana's father's sister Aunt Yalta came to live with the family.  Yalta is a very strong and calculating woman... a bit of a rogue.  She understands Ana better than anyone.  They are like kindred spirits.  Unlike Ana's parents, Yalta encourages Ana to utilize her talents and inner strength to become the woman she wants to be.The writing style is very straightforward and easily digestible, the way I like it.  Ana meets Jesus in a marketplace at the beginning of the book when she is 14.  Without prior warning, Ana is being brought by her parents to meet an intended elderly husband.  Nearby, Jesus is helping his sister Salome with some threads for sale at a market table.  The second when Ana looks into Jesus's eyes for the first time was a beautiful ""aha"" moment.  Decades later, Ana is right there in the street (along with her mother-in-law Mary) as Jesus is bearing the weight of the cross on his back, struggling with each step to his own execution.  This is an incredible book about a very intelligent, strong, talented and brave woman.  I am overwhelmed.Thank you to Viking / Penguin Publishing Group for providing an advance reader copy via Edelweiss.",5,0,2854,0.204,0
47,"I was, for some strange reason, an avid Cardinals fan despite living north of New York.  The Yankees were too imperious, and the Mets were just too awful.  But the Cardinals...I thought Bob Gibson was the epitome of pitching, and the outfield of Lou Brock, Curt Flood and OMG Roger Maris was amazing.  ""Lefty"" Carlton was on that team, as was Tim McCarver.And, of course, it was the team of Stan Musial, Stan the Man, whom Brooklyn fans like my dad, loved, respected and HATED!!!  Because he was SO good, so nice, and beat the stuff out of the Bums.The 1968 series was the first WS I watched avidly, every game.  If it was on the weekend, I'd watch start to finish.  If it was during the week, I'd rush home from school to watch what was left.  I was 13.The opening game was simply THE best baseball game I've ever seen.  Not even the playoff game between the Yanks and the Red Sox, with the amazing Bucky Dent homer, and a kid named Doyle in '78 was better than seeing Gibby, in the opener of the WS, smash the HR record!I didn't hate the Tigers--they had GREAT players, Lolich, Horton, Kaline, but I was disappointed to see McLaine the first 30 game winner since Dizzy Dean, not pitch well.That was October 50 years ago, and I still remember it, including the heartbreak of Gibson, till then the best WS pitcher ever finally lose (At that time, only Lefty ""Goofy"" Gomez for the Yanks was undefeated in WS play--and Gibby).  I even remember some of the commercials--People getting ""Dodge Fever"" at the worst times so they'd run out and buy the new 1969 Dodge.  And the cigarette commercials:  ""Decsisions, decisions!  Do I want good, rich taste, or the one that's lower in tar than the best selling filter kings?""  I don't remember the brand anymore...Pall Mall?So I really looked forward to this book about that series, played when I still had the magic in my eyes of a kid, but old enough to understand the game.  And it's BORING!!  Lots of remembrances from players that have nothing to do with the series, and little interests (Though Gates and the hot dog and ketchup story is pretty funny).  I haven't even made it to the half-way point and, frankly, I'm bored.It's just too loose and too unfocused and I'm working too hard to read it.  I don't know if I'll finish because of this.  It is a little disconcerting at how little the players respected their bodies and their extraordinary talents.  Even a mediocre MLB player is an amazingly talented athlete, performing insanely difficult tasks.  Not to knock pro football but throwing a great pass, or catching one doesn't require the same precision that painting the corners with multiple spins and speeds, or, conversely hitting the thing with all those spins, speeds, locations and movement does.But the stories seem to have little or no direction, and I'm struggling to get through it.",2,0,2844,0.194,1
48,"Mindy Mejia continues to impress me with her writing skills.  This is the third book of hers I have read, and each one of them has a unique style, flare to them, and the topics of the pots are vastly different.  This alone is a testament to her abilities as a writer.Once again, based in Minnesota, Mejia's home state, Strike Me Down tackles financial investigations through the eyes of a determined CPA.  I'm confident that the time Mindy spent as a CPA influenced aspects of the book, and certainly made it stronger.The book starts off with a riveting scene that grabs the reader's attention.  Once the reader has been hooked, the book delves back into the history of the characters to help fill in some of the details that make them who they are today.  Nora is a tenacious CPA who has the notoriety of being a whistleblower that took down a major corporation, which happened to be run by a close friend of her family.  Logan is a kick boxer that has found success after success in the arena, becoming a star and the global face of the company founded by her and her husband Greg.  She is larger than life.  Greg has been content to sit in the background, running the company and managing its expansions as the brand continues to grow and evolve.The book centers on a major, worldwide kick boxing tournament to be held in Minneapolis, sponsored by Strike, and including a $20 million payday for the winner.  There is one catch, the money is found to be missing from Strike's accounts a week prior to the tournament.  The firm that Nora works for, specializing in discreet investigations is hired and turned loose to try and fulfill the heroic and virtually impossible task of finding and recovering the funds before the end of the tournament.I found the book to be interesting and engaging.  The lookback at the history of the characters was a little sluggish, but it did provide valuable insight into the characters and helped to build the foundation for the story.  The kick boxing aspect was interesting, and certainly not the center of the story arc for any of the books I've previously read.  I wasn't fully emotionally connected with the characters, but the strength of the writing and storytelling compensated for that, and I found it hard to set the book down.  The story moves along at a good pace, and has several twists and turns along the way.  There are lies and duplicity, emotionally charged scenes, and a-ha moments throughout the story.Strike Me Down is not my favorite book by Mindy Mejia, but it is still a well written and engaging book, and definitely worth the time for anyone looking for a good mystery, investigative, who done it type of thriller.I received a copy of this book from the gracious marketing team at Emily Bestler/Atria Books in exchange for my thoughts and opinions.",5,0,2808,0.125,1
49,"Thank you to the publisher, author, and NetGalley for an advanced ecopy of Little Secrets, by Jennifer Hillier.  This is my second book by Jennifer Hillier and I just love her writing style.  Before I review the book, I want to make a marketing comment.  I know I am not alone in my annoyance when a book is marketed as something it is not..  Often times, I believe it mismarketing/misleading descriptions are a big reason readers end up disliking a book they might otherwise have really enjoyed if their opinion wasn't colored by the fact they feel mislead.  This book was presented as a thriller about a couple who's son disappears and the chase to find out what happened to him.The book started and ended with the mystery of the missing boy, but the 70-80% in the middle was pure marital drama that was not really a thriller.  The book worked well and I really did enjoy the story of the marriage drama.  I just kept wondering when the thrill of the mystery was going to come up again and there was waaaaaay too much time spent on other stuff before it ever got back to that.Marin, the mother and wife protagonist, is a super-successful entrepreneur of hair salons for the rich and famous.  when her son goes missing while shopping with her,  she understandably falls apart, even becoming suicidal..  Her husband, Derek, has his own dysfunctional way of dealing with the suffering: he has an affair.  Clearly, their coping mechanisms lead to marital stress.  Marin accidentally finds out about the affair through a private investigator she has secretly hired to keep looking for her son long after the police have determined it is a cold case.  Marin ends up investigating the younger woman her husband is involved with and decides to exact her own revenge.  Few readers will agree with how Marin decides to take said revenge.  Her choice might have been more relatable and empathetic had this been Derek's only affair.  However, the reader is told early on that Derek had cheated on Marin before the kidnapping, WHEN SHE WAS PREGNANT WITH THEIR SON!!!  So knowing about this flaw in Derek's character, the reader might feel similarly to how Marin's best friend and college sweetheart feel:  HOW CAN YOU BE SO STUPID?!?!?!?  The only reason I didn't take any stars off for this misfire from the main character is because, unfortunately, Marin's anger being directed as it was in the book is, unfortunately the most realistic compared to how people respond to affairs in real life.I liked the resolution to the mystery and thought that the way it was woven back into the story was well done.  I will be first in line for the next Jennifer Hillier book.  After Jar of Hearts, I knew she was great at thrillers.  Now this book proves she has a great way or writing about domestic drama equally as strongly.",4,0,2806,0.148,1
50,"The themes of this book are few and readily summarized, though their implications are vast and revolutionary:Virtually all of our social institutions are designed to accommodate the average person, yet there is no average person.  Rather, each of us is a bundle of scores of diverse micro-strengths and micro-weaknesses, and the motivations that we feel, that drive us in life, are likewise comprised of a bundle of micro-motivations, most of which not we, our parents, our schools, or our employers, are even aware of.The one-size-fits-all philosophy (the ""Standardization Covenant"") that arose (appropriately) with the age of mass production and efficiency experts that ushered in the 20th century is now obsolete and counterproductive, and has produced modern societies of less than happy people.We can improve our lives and get onto the track of pursuing happiness (in the sense of fulfillment) by discovering our own micro-motivations (the particular kinds of tasks and experiences that float our boat), by taking a thorough inventory of our micro-motivations, and our micro-strengths and weaknesses, and by seeking out, or creating, the specific kinds of opportunities to which we, uniquely, are fitted - thus pursuing and discovering the unique individuality that we each represent.Contrary to the Standardization Covenant that is foisted on us by society, that requires us to pick one of a limited number of standardized career tracks or lifestyles, we all have specific micro-talents and -motivations that we can build on, and we all, therefore, have a fighting chance of finding or creating just the niche that we would flourish in.  That is, we all have a good chance of achieving a priori improbable dark horse success in some way or ways.In particular, our mostly failing schools (my characterization) need to be radically overhauled to create personalized learning opportunities that take cognizance of the fact that we all have different minds, cognitive styles, and different suites of talents and deficiencies.Our American society needs to refocus our original national goals - on the unalienable rights to ""life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness"" proclaimed in our founding document, the Declaration of Independence.  The authors argue that the Founding Fathers understood this language to be both an assertion that both sovereignty and the national purpose are and should be rooted in individualism, and that the ""pursuit of happiness"" means specifically both the right and the civic duty of each individual to pursue his own chosen, micro-fitted path to fulfillment (I don't know about the ""civic duty"" - that seems to contradict the spirit of individualism.Being a radical individualist ""dark horse"" myself, and one with a lifelong interest in education, I naturally enjoyed reading this book, and not only because it reinforces many of the conclusions I came to long ago, in my youth.  The book is replete with interesting anecdotal narratives of individuals achieving dark horse success, in many cases after abandoning prestigious and lucrative, but ultimately unfulfilling, careers, for the micro-fitted pursuits that made them eager to get up in the morning.Although the authors don't expand much on the broader social implications of their theses, it's rather obvious that the devastating social pathologies that beset our society are at least greatly aggravated in consequence of the failure of our social institutions to encourage, or even tolerate the truly individual pursuit of happiness/fulfillment.Nor do Rose & Ogas appear to be cognizant of the deep irony of a couple of comfortably ensconced ivory tower Harvard Professors (at its Graduate School of Education) preaching the centrality of individual freedom and the pursuit of micro-fitted happiness and fulfillment at an institution that imposes such rigid political correctness on its student body and faculty that even a distinguished social scientist like Professor Charles A. Murray are persona non grata - never mind that Murray's own views on education, as expressed in Real Education: Four Simple Truths for Bringing American Schools Back to Reality (2008) overlap so substantially with those of the authors.Just for the record, Murray's ""four simple truths"" are: (1) ability varies; (2) half of the children are below average; (3) too many people are going to college [as opposed to other sorts of schools and training programs that better fit their talents]; and (4) America's future depends on how we educate the academically gifted.Murray is best known, of course, as the co-author of The Bell Curve (with distinguished psychometrician Richard Herrnstein, the lead author), a book (most of whose critics have never read) whose whole purpose was to bring the concept of IQ out of the academic closet, and educate, not only the reading public, but also ideologically purblind academics, as to its meaning, its import, and its limitations.  Murray has since become a critic of the pathological focus of college admissions offices on standardized measures of fitness for college like the SATs, solely for their own convenience - and also so that they can fudge the admissions process to flatter their own prejudices and ideological proclivities - one of the minor theses also, of Dark Horse.I don't know whether the authors of Dark Horse have defied political correctness and read Herrnstein & Murray's book, but in their own critique of, not so much IQ tests, per se, as of the way people misinterpret them in supposing that they reduce talent to a single numerical score, they carefully avoid denying (what virtually all psychometricians accept) that there is, in fact, a G Factor (a general parameter of mental efficacy) that IQ tests measure, as well as many different and diverse micro-talents that the comprise the subtests of IQ tests.  One can wholeheartedly agree with the authors of Dark Horse that we should be paying much more attention than we do to the scores on these subtests and other evidences of micro-talents, while also recognizing and taking into account that there is, in fact, a G factor that typically acts as a multiplier for those micro-talents - when they are also aligned with individual micro-motives.The main focus in this book is on improving education in America, and although the authors are too polite (to a fault) to point it out, our school factories on both the K-12 and college levels, have for many years, even decades, been graduating students who can barely read, write, or handle simple math, let alone think critically.  The most recent international PISA assessments have ranked the products of American schools just about dead last among OECD counties in just about every category, including (irony of ironies) sophistication in the use of modern technology.Thus, what I most appreciated in this book in addition to the personal dark horse anecdotes, were the authors' advertisements for several promising experimental approaches to education that make end arounds the dismal and ineffective American K-12 schools of today, and another that bypasses the college scam and gouge.  In particular, there are the free open enrollment Summit charter public schools of northern California and Washington State, which have devised a format for personalized learning and individual student mentoring. The catch: demand for places greatly outstrips supply - a dilemma that the schools resolve without engaging in bias and favoritism by the excellent, and fair, means of lottery.And on the college level, Southern New Hampshire's spinoff, the College for America, offers a rigorous open enrollment four year college program for less than a 10th what the typical college charges.  Best of all, instead of a plethora of required courses, artificial deadlines, and grades, students have much control over their curricula, and progress at their own pace in their chosen courses to the point where they can pass a competency exam.  Those who are brighter and/or more industrious can progress faster and lower the cost of their education even more.  Most students, it is said, graduate with little or no debt - and are eminently prepared for jobs since that is one of CfA's principal missions, and in aid of that it partners with over 100 employers and institutions to obtain internships and the like for their students.These educational experimnts are touted not as final solutions to the massive educational problem in this country, but as highly promising alternatives, and there are many other successful initiatives and programs to draw on from the past, including especially the work of Marva Collins.This book presents broad and important themes and has very ambitious goals that go far beyond educational reform, but ironically its strengths, I think, lie in the examples it presents - ironically, because by definition, dark horses are unique individuals who blaze their own custom and inimitable paths through the particular jungles their own choosing.",5,0,8990,0.119,1
51,"In Lindsay Chervinky's The Cabinet: George Washington and the Creation of an American Institution, the reader is afforded the opportunity to learn how President George Washington utilized the managerial skills he learned as commander of the Continental Army and incorporated them into the creation of the first presidential cabinet.  The cabinet, functioning in a similar fashion as Washington's most trusted military advisors from the Revolutionary War were essential in assisting the first president in the decision making process related to both domestic and international issues.  The narrative highlights how Washington relied upon the opinions of Alexander Hamilton, Thomas Jefferson, Henry Know, and Edmund Randolph both in oral and written form to guide him through his use of the executive powers of the presidency.  Through detailed analysis of incidents such as Shays Rebellion, the Neutrality Crisis, the Whiskey Rebellion, and the Jay Treaty, Chervinsky shows the inner workings of the cabinet.  More importantly, Chervinsky highlights Washington's skill in managing four differing personalities, who despite personal animosity between some (jefferson and Hamiliton) worked to ensure the executive branch was not merely a figurehead position, but one with relevant functions within the national government.  Towards the end of Washington's presidency, we are introduced to new members of the cabinet and are shown how the president began to rely less on his cabinet, other than Randolph for important decisions.  We see a president who by this point in his presidency has undergone intense criticism and dealt with government authorities (federal and state) who were unwilling to work with him for the good of the nation, but more so for the good of either the Federalist party or the Republican-Democratic party.  We see the frustration in Washington as these political opponents often tried to undermine the executive power of the President.  But we are also shown how Washington stuck to his foundation and used his cabinet and other advisors to defeat the opposition and achieve results for the good of the nation.  While not all of the decisions may have been the correct one's, they were not made through impulsive acts.  They were made through careful deliberations and consultations and a thorough review of evidence.  Concluding the narrative, Chervinsky brings to light the influence Washington's use of the cabinet had on his successors up to the modern era.  While not all presidents have had the same success as Washington had with his cabinet or have utilized the cabinet in the same manner as Washington, the tools and techniques he used within his own cabinet carried over to John Adams and Thomas Jefferson and many more presidents that followed.  For those seeking an understanding of Washington's inner circle of advisors and how they along with the first President managed the first eight years of the executive office, this narrative is the perfect start.",5,0,2989,0.095,1
52,"A dog's breakfast is defined as a mish-mosh of ingredients of varied quality.  Presumably a dog will eat anything, in any combination.  The Misadventures of Nero Wolfe is an unhappy dog's breakfast with a number of choice morsels mixed with other mediocre and lesser fare.  It suggests itself like one of those Mickey Rooney-Judy Garland movies.  ""Hey kids, lets invite all our friends over and put on a stage show.""  While Mickey can dance and Judy sure can sing, the rest of the crew is middling at best.  The scattered nuggets in TMofNW are entertaining on their own.  Loren Estleman is a pro at serving parody at the right temperature.  But to put his work in the same volume as a hack is an affront to good taste.  Parody and pastiche only succeed when the writer gives due recognition to the serious essence of the original source.  When Wolfe becomes an overblown dullard craving lifetime admission to a freakish sideshow as a fee, the comic seasoning and is lost.  Certainly Robert Goldsborough's Murder in E Minor is one of his true early triumphs in continuing the Wolfe corpus, but excerpting the first chapter is weak tea as an example of how adept the story really was - foreplay takes time and in and of itself isn't close to being a satisfying climax.  Writus interruptus.  Presenting this sliver adds little to understanding how well crafted the whole book was.  A more intelligent approach would have been to present a thoughtful review of the book and place it in context with the corpus and Goldsborough's subsequent books.  Now that would have been a bracing contribution.  And required honest scholarship.  It's so much easier to cut and paste.  None of the efforts in TMofNW's introductory section till any new ground in appreciating Stout and Wolfe (even given the excellence of Penzler's essay).  The well trod words and phrases (""My father always took Nero and Archie quite seriously"") and the self-congratulatory fluff ("". . . what I believe to be the cream of the crop."") are nice - in the traditional definition of that adjective.  It is a treat to read a number of the works in the book.  Narcejac's The Red Orchid is particularly captivating for the very European depiction of Archie with his lips and hands all over the female's face and hair - a shock to the sensibilities that flies in the face of PC culture's dictates.  It's a bit like Casanova writing a manual on speed dating.  Almost anything Lawrence Block pens is a pleasure to read.  One-third of TMofNW is on point and stimulating.  One-third is hollow.  And the other third isn't worth the reader's time or dough.  TMofNW reminds the reader of nothing less than a riddle the reader learned in college many moons ago.

53,"Spoiler alert:  Read at your own risk:  First the good thing, the author writes well enough that he can be engaging and if it wasn't because of big logical holes in the plot, it could actually be a decent book.  Characters are a bit flat and there is not a lot of character development, but it is an action story...so that's Ok...but man...here is a space ship sent to explore new worlds and maybe make first contact...so they have two guys in command, a civilian (ambassador) that argues with the maturity of a 10 year old, tantrums and all, but he is the leader of the mission?  And a captain that acts like a rookie on a boy scout first outing...  They arrive at a solar system, do no scans or study any of the planet they find life in (as a matter of fact they pretty much meeny miny moe which of the habitable planets they go to first as there are several in the habitable zone)...forget about studies from orbit, observation, nada...let's land wherever and lets get out of the shuttle right away, who cares if we find dangerous situation, will fly by the seat of our pants...their main mission is first contact, but within 30 minutes they kill their first contact and now they are running away being chased by the indignant natives...they manage to get back to the ship...and lo and behold this highly trained crew...forgot to count their team and only after a few minutes have passed realized they left a man behind (more like a Walmart crew than a highly trained Space Ship first contact team)...even though they almost died...of course they go back again right away with no better plan.  They find another alien species...and of course within 10 minutes of this new contact...they have killed him too!!!!  This is how you would expect a Space Force under Donald Trump command would act...so it is sheer incompetence the whole time...at least he is consistent in that humans get their arse kicked thoroughly at every turn (and so they should if they are that stupid).You would only go for first contact with an expendable crew, obviously you would have to be willing to die rather than risk a war with beings that could potentially destroy you...otherwise you shouldn't go at all.  Finally...they think the aliens want to conquer Earth...so what do they do?...they head to Earth, so they can be followed!! (they have stowaways that read the captains mind to get the final details of Earth location)...again, a pity, because I managed to finish the book despite of the constant frustration with the obvious flaws (there is no way a crew would be that clueless) because the author does write well enough to make it interesting, but if he just put attention and effort to have a credible plot, I think he has potential to write a good book.",2,0,2745,0.071,0
54,"I have been a fan of Deon Meyer for several years, and I have read most of his novels, both stand-alones and the six books in the Benny series.  I was first attracted to him because I wanted to read some crime fiction set in Africa, a continent I knew next to nothing about.  Meyer’s books have subsequently taken me all over South Africa from Cape Town to Pretoria to awesome national parks.  Meyer writes in Afrikaans, so there is usually a bit of a publishing delay to accommodate translation schedules, European release dates, etc.- a bit of a nuisance because I am always awaiting the Next Book.Benny is an officer on an elite police force dubbed the Hawks.  He is divorced, loves music and plays in a band on his off-hours.  He has a drinking problem.  The drinking flares up, often, seemingly in almost every book.  I am impatient with it, and not at all sympathetic; for me it has been a huge negative for most of this series.  I will add two other comments about Meyer’s books before addressing “The Last Hunt” (LH).  I felt the previous book, #5, “Icarus” was perhaps the best in the series: a big plus was it’s featuring all of the officers in the unit and getting to know each, along with his/her special skills.  Unfortunately, most of that cast was missing in LH.  Finally, Meyer is, for me at least, unique in that I enjoyed his stand alone novels as much, probably more than, the anchor Benny series (try “Blood Safari” first!)….LH begins with a new “hero”, Daniel Darret, who cannot sleep and takes a middle of the night walk in Bordeaux, France.  Where he encounters a woman being chased by five screaming young men; they are not playing tag.  Daniel saves the day.  In the next chapters, Benny and partner Cupido, are picking up a new case, the apparent murder of a private investigator who may have been thrown off the luxury train to Pretoria; the case moves along.  And suddenly we are back to Daniel in France.  And like a tennis match, chapters flip characters back and forth, with no obvious connection….for a rather long time.  Then Benny and partner get involved with another death, a personal matter involving their boss.  Murder?  Suicide?  Let’s get into the evidence, and wow, do we get into the evidence.  Maybe too much.  For me, way too much.  Got a bit yawny here.  After too long,  all three elements (Daniel, the train thing, and the murder/suicide) link up , and perhaps like me you will get a déjà vu sensation, like is this Meyer’s “Day of the Jackal”?  Hmmm.  Definite similarities in some respects.  Bottomline, LH is good but it’s not another “Jackal”.  Intriguing title “Last Hunt”  Last Benny?  OK by me, but I’d like to see a new Meyer series.",3,0,2689,0.084,1
55,"I received a complimentary copy of the book from the publisher in exchange for an honest review.“Poverty has a great appetite for eating one's dignity, but Elimane was one of those people who fought to keep his, even when that was the only battle he was winning.""When I finished this book, I immediately said I will read Beah's other books.  A Long Way Gone has lingered on my shelf for years but I'll get back to that in a moment.Beah's writing is beautiful and transporting.  I followed this little family of five—Elimane, Khoudiemata, Ndevui, Kpindi and Namsa—wondering what happened that brought them all together, but immediately being drawn to their determination to live and love the family they've become.They have an unlikely home, the remains of an airplane that crashed, but they've turned it into a place all their own.  After I stopped waiting for the back story, I began to understand there is much to be understood from the lives they live right now to consume my thoughts and emotions.  I worried for them each day as ""corrupted"" for food and money, necessities for each day.  I was relieved each night as they returned home.Each character also had something that was their own.  Elimane had his books; Khoudiemata her personal escape to 96 Degrees; Ndevui his morning runs with the music in his mind; Kpindi seems happiest when they all are together; Namsa, the youngest of the family who likes to go listen to Shadrach the Messiah on the beach front.Each character had a place in my heart Khoudi is who the book eventually centers on.  Khoudi as a central figure in the little family, the big sister, wants more than that role in her life.  We watch her study the people she comes in contact with to shed the identity, even briefly, of being part of her family.  To wonder what it's like to go to school and hang out with friends but also blossoming into a young woman.  It's a surprise to her each time she does this, since the majority of her time is spent with the littles family.  Her beauty is hidden or made invisible in bulky men's clothes she and Namsa wear as a protection from unwelcome advances or dangers (as women).I loved Khoudi and all of the little family.  I laughed at times and I was stressed at times because I feared the worst for them.Little Family is about the lives of young people, with more resilience, intelligence and resourcefulness than the people who overlook them, believe them to be.The surprise in Beah's story telling, in the characters feels extraordinary but tackles so many themes that before you know it, the book has ended.  One thing that resonated with me while reading is that there is a difference between surviving and living, one should not have to choose between them.Next up, A Long Way Gone...",5,0,2760,0.136,1
56,"Amy brought me to tears, made me laugh, made me feel so much faith and hope!!!! that's why I love her writing so much!!!Once again Amy Harmon brings an amazing story that will take us on a journey that we will feel within every fiber of our body and will make us appreciate the find words of this book.Where the lost wander, it's a story of past traditions, family, and love, it is the story of Naomi and her family, the hardship they live and went through while moving to another town. it is the story of John a boy that is quiet but has so much to give and say.Where the lost wander took me to another place and time, showing the hardships of men and woman while moving around in wagons and horses, the hardship of the road, the weather and other tribes that weren't so kind and wanted to steal and kill whatever and whoever wasn't in their own tribe.Naomi was a very strong heroine, always speaking the truth and whatever was on her mind, I love how strong she was, always giving love to everybody but also very assertive and always speaking without any fear. she was very creative and talented, she was always drawing and painting the many faces in her life, the faces that accompanied her during this long journey called life.John the hero was quiet but always very assertive, he was a strong hero but what made him so different was that he didn't need to speak or be aggressive to show his feelings. he was very thoughtful and very quiet but at the same time making him so strong.The story of John and Naomi didn't start with honey and kisses, he was very stubborn and she was, even more, she was determined to get what she wanted and what she wanted, was him, I feel like her character was perfect for John because she challenges him at all times.One of the things that I love about this story is the way we feel at all times like we're in that wagon moving around, making a life of our own. the intensity, the depth of the story, and characters really made you feel every single emotion the characters are experiencing.I cry so much with the last couple of chapters, I love the secondary characters especially baby wolf, Naomi's mother was a very fine lady, so many great characters that brought so much to this story and the characters.I really have a hard time writing reviews for books that I love, I never find the right words to express how much this makes my heart sing, but Where the lost wander is one of those books that no matter how much I write it will never bring the amazing emotions and feelings of the story.Overall it was an amazing book, I definitely recommend it and I will re-read it again soon.",5,0,2623,0.234,0
57,"To be honest, I picked this up after all the positive buzz from my Goodreads friends.  This isn't my first go-round with vampire related reads.  I unexpectedly devoured with extreme pleasure the Twilight series a decade ago.  Looking to replicate that positive experience, I moved on to the Sookie Stackhouse and Black Dagger Brotherhood books.  I've been ""vampire free"" since then.  I normally gravitate towards historical fiction and biographies, so this certainly was a palate cleanser.This story took place during the 90's in a southern town called the Old Village near Charleston.  It was a place people moved to as a refuge; a place where you could keep your doors unlocked, count your neighbors as dear friends and let your children play outside in safety.  A group of women decided to form a book club.  A lot of the books they read were popular true crime books that we all are familiar with.  I actually bought one of them while reading this book, I was so intrigued.  Fairly early on in the book, the main character Patricia Campbell has an absolutely horrific and grisly encounter with an elderly neighbor while bringing out her garbage at the end of the night.  It was so disgusting I was really taken aback, but it certainly got my attention!  To cut to the chase, it turned out that a man named James Harris purported to have come to town to care for a sickly aunt was actually a vampire.Of course, at first nobody wants to believe you...they think you're nuts.  The ladies are all stay at home housewives that at one time had careers, but now they cater to the whims of their husbands.  They spend their days taking care of the home and their children.  To be honest, I did enjoy reading about the cleaning and doing laundry; I just hate doing those things myself.  The vampire ingratiates himself deeply into the community via the husbands and a shared investment in a real estate project.  The more Patricia tries to coalesce her book group and their husbands around the idea of confronting and dealing with James Harris, the more resistance she gets.  In truth, no one wants to believe her.  However, Patricia has seen something the others haven't, and it's a mind picture of him feeding on one of his victims she could never forget.The ""action"" scenes involving the vampire James are absolutely riveting and consuming.  His feedings are orgasmic encounters involving great pain followed by extreme pleasure.  The ladies must come together with sheer bravery to extinguish this abomination disguised as town friend.  I found this to be a very original take on a vampire story that held my interest, and I would highly recommend.Thank you to the publisher Quirk Books / Random House for providing an advance reader copy via Edelweiss.",4,0,2752,0.154,0
58,"I don’t read a ton of contemporary romance, but I have a few favorite authors for the genre.  Jessica Pennington is one of them.Sidney and Asher started off as friends.  Their parents were best friends and they started renting lake houses next to each other in Riverton.  Something happened at the end of that first summer that changed things.  From that point on, they played pranks on each other.  These weren’t silly little pranks either.  They were well thought out, extreme things.  It’s not that they hated each other, but they definitely weren’t friends that got along.They are at their lake houses the summer before their senior year when the pranks went too far.  Both families were kicked out of the rentals and had to find a new place during peak season.  The only house they found was on the other side of the lake.  It was for sale, but they were able to rent it.  Together.  Now Asher and Sidney’s rooms are next to each other, connected by a bathroom.Things start to change that summer.  Asher kisses Sidney one night when they’re drunk.  After the prank got them kicked out, they decided to call a cease fire.  Instead of doing pranks on each other, they teamed up to prank Nadine, their old landlord.  Asher starts being super nice to Sidney.  She’s still a bit uptight and has zero trust.  Somehow, they start dating.  The whole time, Sidney thinks that Asher can’t really like her and that he’s somehow working on a big prank.  The truth is that Asher has liked her for years.  She can’t accept it.  It’s how her mind works.  It might be self esteem.  It’s definitely a trust issue.  Sidney also over analyzes everything (like I do), so it seems like this relationship was doomed from the start.  And they are both doing to be on swim team at the same college in the fall.The setting on the lake in Riverton was perfect, but made me miss the sun (Where have you been sun?  I haven’t seen you in weeks.)  Asher’s best friend wasn’t in a lot of the book, but I really liked him.  I also loved Kara and thought the group at the parties was a nice addition.  The parents were great.  But the standouts were Asher and Sidney.  Especially Asher.  I adored him.  Their banter and sarcastic dialogue flowed so well.  I loved that the book went into the beginning of college, too.  It wasn’t just a summer romance book.  Things were not all perfect and full of kissing, though there was a lot of kissing.  The relationship felt real the whole time.I gave this book 5 stars.  Thank you to Tor Teen and Edelweiss for my review copy.  Thank you also to Jessica Pennington for adding me to the acknowledgements.  You made my whole winter.",5,0,2644,0.269,1
59,"Although there is some subtle rehashing, this book kind of assumes that you are aware of certain events that happened in previous adventures and relationships formed in past books.  As I had not started this series (I have read the author's other award-winning series about an exiled capital inspector in Tibet), I found that I needed to go back and read the first book in this series, Bone Rattler, to get an idea of the protagonist and what he stands for and the relationships he develops.  I actually respect the idea of the author writing a series without having to backtrack as much to explain to new entrants to not interrupt narrative flow, and for reasons later in this review, I find it quite worth it to have read the first three books in the series before turning to this one.  To understand the relationship forged between Duncan and Conawago and the other Iroquois is necessary to understand why the events of this book play out.Turning to this book, the basic plot seems unusually odd for a historical novel, help a dig site get out some dinosaur bones and for reasons inexplicable to Duncan as well, and take them to Benjamin Franklin, plenipotentiary in London, to prevent a war.  On the surface, this plot seems very unworkable because to link a murder mystery to something esoteric like digging, but this is contextually believable considering the sort of trouble that Duncan gets into in other books.  After noticing that everyone associated with the dig is targeted for murder with some really efficient killers, what brings Duncan to England is to save his mentor/best friend Conawago who is imprisoned at Bedlam Sanitarium using the bones to as collateral to get assistance going to England.  The mystery and the rescue form two very satisfying threads when Duncan arrives in England, and honestly, I cared more for the rescue than the mystery itself, but both are worth reading to the end.  If there is a downside to this story, there are a couple of places in the narrative where information is conveniently withheld for the sake of moving the plot, but the method of hiding is a bit too obvious as a plot artifice.  I just put that out of my mind while enjoying this good story, and since we all know what happens historically, you know that there is an element of both success and failure in the expedition but how this book succeeds is making you invested in both the characters, the atmospheric setting, and moving action.  The writing is much more polished than the first book in this series, and the characterization transcends even the well-researched historical setting (although I am curious about how excavations and other archaeological digs occurred in the 18th century now).",5,0,2711,0.145,0
60,"HID FROM OUR EYES by Julia Spencer-Fleming is the ninth book in the Clare Fergusson/Russ Van Alstyne Mystery Series.  It’s the excellently crafted multiply time frame story of three unsolved murders, how they are all connected and how the three crimes and the people involved are woven together into one complete picture.The center of the story is based around Millers Kill Chief of Police Russ Van Alstyne and his wife, Reverend Clare Fergusson in the present time as they manage their independent jobs, their recent marriage, and new parenthood.  Each carries past baggage that makes them who they are and plays in how they proceed in the future.  Along the way, we learn more about the people within the police department - who have their own problems, and the fight to keep that department from being dissolved and taken over by the “staties”.  Even the retired police chief shows up playing an important part in putting the pieces together in this perplexing murder mystery that has spanned decades.The mystery of the story deals with the murders of three young woman all found dead along McEachron Hill Road.  All three have with no identity, no evidence and no clues to the possible means of death – natural or by criminal intent.  Are they all connected?  Possible copycat murders?  Three times is too many to be coincidental.Although this is a story that spans three generations (1952 – 1972 – and present time), the story is told so accurately and smoothly that there is no confusion whatsoever in figuring out the time a particular part of the story you are reading or the characters within that part of the story.  I. personally, loved the way the story flowed back and forth from one generation to the other, how we got to witness the characters develop in that time travel, and how all the characters connect up to make one seamless story.This was the first book I have read in this series.  I can attest to the fact that it can definitely be read as a standalone.  There are aspects I am sure that were detailed in previous books as well as there are some loose threads that will be address in future books.  These facts do not add to or distract from the mystery solved in this book – which was amazing.  This one book had made me a definite follower of Julia Spencer-Fleming.  I will be checking out the other books in this series as well as looking forward to book number ten.I recommend HID FROM OUR EYES to anyone that loves a fabulous well-written mystery, a story that takes years to unfold but only hours to devour and a book that will have you turning pages trying to figure out the whodunit from page one to the very end.  Definitely has my 5+ Stars!",5,0,2675,0.07,0
61,"Married couple Marcia Muller and Bill Pronzini are both best-selling authors of crime fiction.  Together, they created ""Deadly Anniversaries,"" an extremely unique anthology of mystery short stories that commemorates the Mystery Writers of America's (MWA) 75th anniversary.  Not only did each one have their own submission, but they approached eighteen other authors, asking them to submit a mystery story that pertains to a type of anniversary.  (All the invited authors are MWA Grand Masters, Edgar winners, or have served as MWA presidents.)  The anniversaries ranged from weddings to birthdays to deaths to tragic events such as the bombing of Hiroshima.  The quality of the works ranged from fairly good to excellent.  When I read each of the nineteen stories, I took notes as though I was judging it in a contest.  Personally, I like an intriguing mystery that is complex, perplexing, bloody, and shocking.  How many of these stories met my stringent expectations?  Which ones did I like the most?  My favorite story in ""Deadly Anniversaries,"" after much deliberation, is Doug Allyn's shoot-'em-up thriller, ""30 and Out.""  As for me, I did 34 and was out.  On December 31, 2019, I retired after 34 years of service with the Federal Government.  In ""30 and Out,"" Sergeant Charles Marx is on the verge of retiring.  Unfortunately, while conducting a raid on a meth lab, a sniper shoots him in the throat, ending his life.  The story's protagonist, Sergeant Jax LaDart, is an excellent investigator; he quickly locates the killer.  The killer's reason for slaying Marx is quite shocking and depressing.  This is a revenge story that proves, once again, that your past sins will eventually find you out.  Another revenge story that I won't soon forget is Peter Robinson's poison-laden ""Aqua Vita.""  However, this is revenge from beyond the grave.  A pair of young lovers, Cheryl and Marco, commit the perfect murder at the Mystique restaurant.  However, when they rendezvous exactly one year later, they learn their love for one another has changed--drastically changed.  The ending is rather violent and shocking.  What did I learn after reading this story?  Tap water is just as safe, if not safer, as expensive bottled water.  Quite a few villains in ""Deadly Anniversaries"" employed poison as a means of killing their victims.  Another story that I enjoyed is Peter Lovesey's ""The Bitter Truth.""  It was quite creepy.  Sometimes, truth hurts; sometimes, it kills.  Judson Perrin is a famous toxicologist who is very grave and will soon die.  Mark Peters, a corrupt journalist, has been hired to obtain a few quotes from the toxicologist--quotes that are intended to enliven his obituary.  However, Peters wishes to slander Perrin, which proves to be a fatal mistake.  Intriguing mysteries involving the death of a sibling can be found in Margaret Maron's ""The Replacement"" and Carolyn Hart's ""Case Open.""  Eighteen-year-old Matthew is the replacement for his brother, Calder, who died when an unknown driver struck him on a dark, lonely stretch of road.  If Calder hadn't died, Matthew wouldn't have been born.  Despite objections from those around him, Matthew is determined to find his brother's killer.  Peggy Prescott's sister, Evelyn Marlow, was pushed from a cliff.  A year later, the case is still open.  Peggy invites a group of friends to her cliffside mansion in hopes of unveiling a killer among them.  If you like historical mysteries with strong elements of romance, then you must read Laurie R. King's wartime gem, ""Ten Years On.""  Mary Russell, the wife of Sherlock Holmes, proves to be as adept at detective work as her famous husband.  An Indian soldier, Anik Singh, enlists Mary's help to learn what really happened to his brother, Manvir Singh.  Ten years ago, Manvir was wounded in the Battle of Neuve Chapelle.  He was recovering quite well at the Royal Pavilion.  However, he took a sudden turn for the worst and died.  Anik suspects foul play.  Indeed, there was.  However, there was also a forbidden romance between Manvir, a ""brown"" man, and a white nurse.  As I've stated many times before, I like my stories to have endings that will shock me.  The following accomplished this:  A wife obtains vengeance against her philandering husband in Sue Grafton's humorous ""If You Want Something Done Right . . .""  A wife is driving her husband's corpse across a Nevada desert when someone attempts to rape her in Wendy Hornsby's violent ""Ten Years, Two Days, Six Hours.""  Never come between an eighty-year-old woman and the last piece of birthday cake in Max Allan Collins' startling ""Amazing Grace.""  Amazing.  The entire collection of mystery short stories in ""Deadly Anniversaries"" is rather amazing.  There are other stories I enjoyed, but there is not enough space here to praise them all.  It is one of the best anthologies I've read to date.  It was difficult to put aside.  Like chocolate candy, I found myself devouring one story after another.  I love reading murder mysteries.  Most every story, except perhaps two, involved one or more murders.  ""Deadly Anniversaries"" would make an excellent gift for someone, like myself, who enjoys reading mysteries.  I must praise the contributors for rising up to the challenge of creating a story based on an anniversary.  Naomi Hirahara's ""The Last Hibakusha"" involves a murder on the anniversary of the bombing of Hiroshima.  I must thank Hirahara for reminding me of the horrors of the atomic bomb and why it is so important that America and her allies are united by love rather than divided by hate.",5,0,5577,0.17,1
62,"What I liked about this sprawling story is the relatively obscure time and location (Vietnam in the 1930s) and the genuflecting in the direction of social justice and political reality.  It portrays a relatively honest picture of the French economic exploitation of the Indochina region; the raw brutality of the French industries (notably Michelin) in their treatment of local workers; and the repression of local businesses and cultural institutions in accordance with the French interest in a form of ""mission civilatrice"" for their Asian colonies.  Also to be admired is the author's efforts to describe the physical appearance of Hanoi and environs in the 1930s.What I found lacking in the novel was the absence of resolution to the various story threads that the author sets out at the beginning.  The focus on two women who follow their businessmen husbands to Vietnam is interesting at the outset, but their motivations, relationship, and actions/reactions to local events are often not credible.  And the women's characters, which are meant to represent good and not-so-good, come across as self-absorbed and manipulative.  There are no heroes in this novel among the principals.  In fact, there are only a few likable characters among the secondary cast.The book chronicles a period when revolutionary feelings were running high in Vietnam/Indochina, but the author can't quite decide whether this is the main theme of the book or a mere backdrop for the more detailed descriptions of the main characters' self-indulgent, louche behavior at ex-pat clubs, obsession with proper clothing, food and drink, expensive autos, luxury hotels and transplanted European architecture.  All of these descriptions have visual interest, but they seem to dominate the storyline and offer a weakened contrast to the physical torture and exploitation that was going on simultaneously.  I have to add that when local culture, history, food, etc. are mentioned, there is never much detail.  Weird, considering how interesting they are to this day.One other aspect that I would call a misfire in ""A Hundred Suns"" is the semi-feminist theme that is a central part of the book.  The two main characters are gradually revealed to be connivers in the extreme; this includes both the ""good"" woman and the ""bad"" one.  The author leans toward an explanation that women striving for better lives had little choice but to ""connive"", but somehow that rationale wasn't persuasive with this reader.It is arguably unfair to go further with the criticism--I will leave at this; this is a book with an intriguing basic structure and some excellent subplots and secondary characters, but most of the potential there is left fallow,  which leaves the reader disappointed and frustrated.",3,2,2759,0.091,1
63,"Just like with Trackers and Hell Divers, I really didn't think I would like Nicholas Sansbury Smith's new book Sons of War.  Why?  Because I was a huge fan of his Extinction Cycle Series!  That was the series that introduced me to Nick and I wanted to be faithful to the series.  Then I read Sons of War, and just like Trackers and Hell Divers, I realized I could love this mew book just as much!  It's like a parent after you have your first child.  You can't even imagine how you could love another child like you do your first one.  Then you have another one, and another, and another snd then you realize you CAN love another child!  That's how I have come to love everything Nick has written.  Each series has different theme and a diffrent group of characters, but they all havecone thing in common...Nick wrote them!How his mind comes up with some of these stories scares me.  I would hate to be inside his head when he dreams!Sons of War is a Mob/Mafia story with hints of the Godfather sent in a Post Apocalyptic time.  Like Extinction Cycle, Trackers and Hell Divers it shows us that sometimes it's not the Monsters that are the scariest most dangerous thing to man.  It's also man himself and how we treat each other.Sons of War is the Story of 2 families trying to survive and gain control in a world gone crazy.  The Moretti's who fled Naples after a massacare and the Salvatores family in LA.  Both families want thr same thing and will do anything and sacrifice anything to achieve their goals.There were parts in SoW that reminded me of the book The Godfather.  I still consider it one of my all time favorite books ever.  Nick's characters are a lot like the ones in The Godfather.  Very well written and very fleshed out.  The way family is thought of is that Family is everything.  You start rooting for each family because no matter what's happening it's the family that remains at the top!This would be a great book to start with if you've never read any of Nick's work, and if you weren't really into Sci Fi.  To me, Nick is sn smazing writer for the simple fact that he flows so easily back and forth between Sci Fi and what I would call the Action/Thriller genre.  I received an ARC book, but because I really enjoy Nick's work and admire him so much as just a great person, I bought a copy to.  I truly believe in supporting the Authors that I enjoy, and Nick is one of the best!  You need to go out and get this book NOW!  You won't be sorry!",5,0,2468,0.176,0
64,"I am a sucker for good marketing and I bought the book from an ad I saw that provided a signed copy at a very reasonable rate.  I am delighted I bought the book.I devoured it immediately and it is worthy of your time.  Politics aside, this dude is not just a war hero, but a certified badass, having gone through US Navy SEAL BUDS Hell Week twice, because he broke his leg on the first pass.Which should make him certifiable, but I’ll let you judge that.Yes, the book is heavy on SEAL training and it gave me more insight into how truly insane that standard of excellence is.  Less than 20% of the candidates succeed, and from the SEALS I know I have determined that any one of them could eat three Marines, and I know many hard-chargers in the latter group, including myself.This is not ghost written.  Crenshaw is no slouch, a graduate of Tufts University and, after his service, Harvard University’s Kennedy School of Government.  He quotes many people with ease, including John Paul II and Thomas Sowell, which gives the reader a clear indication of his leanings.  He is candid about his down-range service, injuries, weak moments of overwhelming self-doubt, and impatience in recovery.There is much to unpack in the book, but my strongest impressions were about his search for meaning, disavowing victim identity politics which turn into a hatred of America, and his personal stoicism.  Yeah, Crenshaw’s a Republican, but I was reading from his reasonable man’s perspective, and I believe he is not one to knee-jerk his way into a corner.Over 87% of the reviews on Amazon are five-star, a true indicator of popularity.  But I read the one-star reviews, and they all broke along politically ideological lines.  Look, I read Barack Obama’s two biographies before he was elected to the presidency, and although I disagreed with virtually everything he stated in both books, I didn’t puke.  They were in his voice and no one should have been surprised by his administration.  I suspect if you don’t agree with a person’s politics you can’t learn from them, according to the negative reviews.  No wonder there is so much unnecessary venom in public discourse today.  Crenshaw rises above that easily.I am predisposed to like the man, appreciate his service and personal sacrifice, and respect his going above his disability and making stuff happen.  Good stuff.  With luck, Crenshaw will remain on the national stage for a long time.  His stoicism and ability to calmly address outrage culture is worthy of all our respect.His last two lines sums it up for him, and I embrace it:  “I will do my part.  I will live with fortitude.”",5,0,2630,0.176,0
65,"I’m a loyal Amos Decker fan, but I have to agree with some of the other reviewers about the latest novel, “Walk the Wire.”1.  This story does not live up to the integrity/creativity/intelligence of the first few books in the series.  Yes, sure it’s okay to allow Decker to evolve as a person (the very end has a genuinely poignant moment between Amos and a family member), but please don’t toss away what is most unique and intriguing about him.  And good grief, give him stories and plot challenges worthy of his skills and unique persona.2.  The MAIN antagonist in this novel (there are several different antagonists and plot lines) does not embody the caliber of ‘bad guy’ traits that Decker is capable of pursuing.  Primarily because the resolution of the story was so implausible.  I respect Baldacci’s talent, so I’m trying to avoid any spoiler alerts here.  Consequently I’ll just say, the motivations of the main antagonist are not realistically (by a long shot) congruent with the extreme lengths to which the antagonist went to satisfy those motivations.  I get it that this is a work of fiction, but the plot still needs to be believable — and in some way relatable — in order for the story to be satisfying to readers.  This story felt more like a punt than an 80 yard kickoff return across the goal line, like the first Amos Decker novels did.3.  Good grief ... seriously, Baldacci resorted to self-indulgent PC politics?  The Geneva Convention?  Really?  The inaccuracy and hypocrisy of the (totally unnecessary to the story) plot line that allows Baldacci to pontificate about the GC is astonishing.  First, terrorists do not abide by the Geneva Convention.  They never signed on and therefore the war on terror will never be won in courts of law.  Terrorists don’t just torture their captives; they behead them.  They have zero respect for human life, whether it be a soldier or women and children.  To an Islamic terrorist, non-Muslims are infidels and are therefore simply targets to be destroyed ... there is zero humanity or empathy in the sociopathic mind of a terrorist.  Second, Will Robie (one of Baldacci’s characters from a different series) certainly does not abide by the Geneva Convention in his national security pursuits.  So why the sudden lecture about adhering to the GC when dealing with terrorists?I do hope there will be more Amos Decker novels.  Amos deserves a long legacy.

66,"i could not stay awake when reading this book.  its just ... boring.  i am not clear if dr j is boring ... the topic matter is of no interest to me ... if the style in which it is written did not appeal to me... if dr j's life (as portrayed) was the problem ... if there was way too much talk about basketball ... a combination of these things or something else altogether.  i just kept thinking, 'dr j cannot be this boring.  he just cannot.  no, he cannot.'but cover to cover the book was extremely dull.for someone who says that he finds analysis of/chatter about basketball 'numbing' (and that is why he did not enjoy being a commentator for the nba), why is so much of this book about basketball?!look, i am the first to admit i may not be the target audience for this autobiography.  i am not a fan of the nba... did not watch dr j during his illustrious career ... and do not particularly care for basketball.  but i do like a good story of the human condition.  to understand how ppl experiences shape and form who they are becoming.  ...to hear of individual personal evolutions inspires me.for me the most ... baring ... truths exposed about dr j's own life were his experiences as they relate to his son, his daughter alexandra and via his omissions.  i can infer ALOT about julius based upon what he did not include about his life.i wanted to review this book as 'hated it' because i really found very little redeeming about it.  but, because i am admittedly not a ""fan"" of dr j or his profession, i concede i may be a little prejudiced; for that reason alone i rate it as a two-star endeavor.altho i would not recommend this book to anyone, if ur a ""fan"", try it.  i do not think u'll like it, but let me know.(in skimming other reviews by ""fan""s, it seems they make a lot of the same criticisms that i make:  the book is ""slow"" and/or lacks depth.  i think they merely rate it higher because they came to the book as a ""fan"".  which review is more accurate... ?  idk.  u be the judge.)btw - i picked up this book because dr j promoted it as a ""candid"" and ""unapologetic"" telling of his life and his experiences.  honesty always appeals to me and i became intrigued.after reading it, it is my opinion that dr j has a certain level of honesty in approaching the topics he covered.  for that i commend him.  but i find this whole book lacks depth ... introspection ... soul searching honesty.  for that, i am a little disappointed.",2,0,2442,0.099,1

Her father-in–law is a man who knows the rules of society.  In fact, he is someone who enforces those rules.  He has forbidden Julia to live anywhere she chooses or go anywhere she chooses.  He has made the rules by which she must live.  If she does not follow his rules he will take her son away from her.  Julia is well aware that he means exactly what he says.She believes she has found a weak spot in the duke’s character.  If she can gather the proof, she will have the power to move out of his home and make a life for she and her son.She accidentally meets Garrett.  He is the owner of a shipping empire and his reputation is that of a man who is a rogue and a rake.He is instantly smitten with Julia.  In fact he is mesmerized.He pushes her to allow him to help her gather the proof against her father–in–law.  He wants her and her charming little boy to have the opportunity to live a happy life.  He also wants to be a part of their lives.Ms Grey is a talented author whose books I always enjoy.For some reason, I was unable to identify with Julia and Garrett.I was hoping for more depth to each of them.Julia has two friends with whom she has created a school for young daughters of men who lost their lives in the sinking of the ship which took her husband.  The school and her son seem to be the main things which have meaning in her life.  Other than the desire to get away from the duke’s control, there does not seem to be much in her.Garrett has created an entire shipping empire and all we hear is that he is besotted by Julia.  And he is willing to go the distance for her.I am sure it is me.  Both Julia and Garrett did not make me fall in love with them.The plot is interesting.  The introduction of Brina, one of the women who started the school with Julia, made me curious.  I hope she is the star of the next book in the series.Although this is second in a series, it works perfectly fine as a stand alone read.Ms Grey has written a good book.

68,"Saddle up to a couch cushion and don’t forget your box of tissues because you’re going to need ‘em!  A fascinating journey, and an emotional odyssey, the kernel for this tale began with the captivating account of an ancestor, John Lowry, who was the 5x great grandfather of Harmon’s spouse – a man with an unusual mixed heritage of a Pawnee Native American mother and a “white” father.Hop on the wagon train as they navigate the Oregon Trail from Missouri across the mid-1800’s landscape toward a free land grant and a new start in California.  Along the way, you’ll fall in love with spunky, young, widow Naomi May, with her zest for life and creative spirit, as well and the stoic, practical, muleteer John Lowry who’s looking to strike out on his own for the first time.  Not to mention the rest of the May family with its passel of sons, Naomi’s quirky former in-laws, and a whole gaggle of personalities bumping along together in the wagon train.This wouldn’t be yarn about the Oregon Trail, however, without danger around every river bend – imperilment from wild animals, clashes with a Native American tribe or two, and subversion by fellow pilgrims.  Your heart will yearn for Naomi and John, who are inexplicably drawn to each other from their first meeting back in Missouri, and you’ll breathlessly read on to see if their budding attachment can survive the tests thrown at them by “the trail”.Harmon is fairly solid at capturing the culture and language of 1850’s America, something she admits was a struggle for her and was at times very uncomfortable.  I can say with confidence that she has hit the mark more squarely than any other modern author (1980’s or later) that I’ve encountered, a feat that is impressive, at the least.  That said, while I do realize the challenges of the modern writer in today’s culture of hyper-presentism, the 21st Century feminist and racial outlooks did still bleed through from time to time.  In that regard, I leave you with the thought-provoking words of the author herself from the Author’s Note on page 339: “I hope the reader will experience the story in the spirit it was written, recognizing that who we are is not who they were, and judging historical people by today’s standards prevents us from learning from them, from their mistakes and their triumphs.  These people helped build the framework that we now stand on.  We should be careful about burning it down.”Where the Lost Wander is A Once Upon a Book Club section (May 2020).

69,"Starbreaker is the second novel in Amanda Bouchet's exciting Sci Fi romance series Endeavor.  I absolutely loved the first book, even though I'm not the biggest Sci Fi fan.  But I was super excited at how much I was enjoying it that I just devoured it!  The second book couldn't come close to being that awesome, could it?  Heck, yes, it could!!!  Tess and Shade are one of my favorite ever romance couples.  Can this book stand alone?  Possibly, but I wouldn't recommend it.  So much occurred in the first book that you would miss some of the excitement and story here if you skipped that one.Tess Bailey, the captain of the Endeavor, is a Nightchaser.  Think of it a cross between Robin Hood and a space pirate.  She and her rebel crew supply much-needed goods to the denizens of the galaxies who are under the rule of the all-powerful, evil Overseer and his feared Dark Watch.  Among the crew is Shade Ganavan, who was a bounty hunter who betrayed Tess, but he gave up everything he had to save her.  The Endeavor is on a mission for the rebel forces to rescue an important scientist from the Dark Watch's clutches on Starbase 12.  A friend of theirs is also being held there, so they plan to break her out, too.  And while they're at it, they plot a huge heist of goods from the Dark Watch.  What could possibly go wrong?!This book was so fast paced I found myself reading quicker the faster the story moved!  It really played like a movie in my head.  I doubt I can get across just how much I love Tess and Shade as a couple.  Though they meant everything to each other, there was still some distrust due to Shade's previous betrayal.  The reappearance of someone from Tess's past doesn't make things easier, either.  Despite this, you could feel the love and lust they have for each other.  Their Endeavor crew mates were all interesting, well fleshed out characters, and they were the family Tess chose for herself.  Equally compelling was Tess's Uncle Nate; he was a complex man, and their relationship was beyond complicated.  And lest I leave anyone out, we have Bonk, the fearsome space cat!  Gotta love Bonk.  Though this story ended on a bit of a cliffhanger, it was not one that took away any pleasure of the book.  It's one that lets you feel excited that Tess, Shade and the crew (and Bonk!) will return for more adventures.I received an ARC of this book courtesy of the publisher and NetGalley.

70,"It’s funny, looking at the cover of this book, it’s not what I pictured Tucker Daniels to look like.  After reading the story, I picture him as being rough and tumble, soft and sexy.  He came off as all that in Asking for Trouble.  But, it was Della looking for trouble that had Tucker asking what trouble he got himself into.There was mutual attraction between these two right from the beginning.  Della was off-limits but Tucker just didn’t have it in him to say no to her.  So, he became her wingman and it killed him.  Watching her go out with all these guys who were after this beautiful, smart, sexy woman for one thing and one thing only, had him sitting on the edge of his barstool waiting for each date to end.  She didn’t disappoint ... she came right back to him after every date disappointed.  Until that one night when the caveman came out and he almost lost it.Della loved every minute she spent with Tucker.  She knew he was attracted to her and refused to act on his feelings because of her brother.  Asking him to take her to the sex shop was a little much but, she never did have a filter on her mouth.  So, as he started vetting her dates, teaching her to drive and helping her move out of her brother’s house, she couldn’t help but fall a little bit deeper in love with him.  She knows she’ll never have a normal relationship but, truly becoming a woman, dating and maybe finding companionship is on the top of her to-do list.  She never thought that taking it slow and steady would be so frustrating or so exhilarating.  Tucker always had her back and he didn’t disappoint her in any way until that one night and her heart broke.Anything for Trouble was an enjoyable read.  You need to get through why Della is with her brother and what she went through in the past.  Warning ... there may be some triggers there for some people.  But, Amy Andrews did a nice job mixing some fun and laughter in with the intense scenes.  She made Tucker amazing.  He was kind, patient and you could just hear the compassion in his voice.  She wrote a cast of characters that were hysterical.  I loved the nursing home residents and the resident romance writer was a hoot.  I have a feeling that we’ll be seeing more of her in the near future.  But, as for the overall story, like I said, it was enjoyable.  It was slow in places and fast-paced in others ... it was funny yet serious.  I truly liked the book and am looking forward to visiting Credence, Colorado again.",4,0,2472,0.207,0
71,"Millicent “Missy” Carmichael can be difficult to like.  A 79 year old lady who lives alone in a big empty London house, she lives for the yearly visit of her son and grandson from Australia.  Her daughter lives closer, but they’ve had a falling out recently and don’t speak much (they were never really close anyway).  The Love Story of Missy Carmichael shows what happens when you open yourself up to new experiences.Missy, daughter of an early, ardent feminist, went off to college and shone brightly as a classics scholar.  One night at a party she meets handsome Leo Carmichael, and is instantly smitten.  They have a brief affair, but then he goes off and she’s left with her books and her longing for him.  When he eventually returns a few years later, they marry and (as women did at the time) she instantly devotes herself to having children and keeping things running while he becomes a famous historian and author.Current events in the novel are interspersed with earlier events from Missy’s life.  Her beloved grandparents, fiercely determined mother, and adored yet absent husband all help to explain how Missy came to be alone, bitter, and yet still yearning after connections.  A decision to go out to a local event leads to unimagined benefits in Missy’s solitary life.  After a spell of light-headedness, Missy meets single mother Angela and her young son Otis (who reminds Missy painfully of her absent grandson), interior designer Sylvie, and, eventually, the new love of her life: a patient and excitable dog named Bobby.Walking Bobby (who Missy agrees to look after “temporarily” for a friend of Angela’s) exposes Missy to a whole new group of acquaintances:  the park dog-walkers.  Since she now has an area of common ground, Missy finds herself suddenly shedding her prickly persona in favor of exchanging dog stories with others who are eager to talk about their furry companions.  Angela is also delighted to find a compliant and available baby-sitter, and young Otis enjoys the attention of a surrogate grandmother.Soon Missy’s life is opening up in ways she could never have imagined.  Having spent her entire life looking after others (with little appreciation or thanks) it’s nice to see her finally enjoying herself and living a little.  There are a few surprises at the end as more and more of Missy’s secrets are exposed.  Overall, the adventures of Missy and Bobby make for an enjoyable and inspiring story of how it’s never too late to find new loves.Disclaimer:  I received an advanced reader’s copy of The Love Story of Missy Carmichael in exchange for this review",4,0,2599,0.223,0
72,"After a disastrous, abusive marriage, Minerva Hepplewhite has become quite good at self-sufficiency.  Even so, her funds are dwindling so when she learns of a mysterious inheritance from a duke she never met, she’s shocked but rather pleased.  If only the man who tracked her down wasn’t so attractive and distracting.Chase Radnor is leery of Minerva, unsure of whether she’s just a woman scorned or is she could be a murderess.  He knows Minerva changed her name and his inquiry into his uncle the duke’s death has Chase convinced it was no accident.  Minerva would’ve had plenty of motive and she’s just as aware of that fact as Chase is so she sets up a discreet detective service to rival Chase’s, despite being woefully unqualified.  Though rather annoyed, part of Chase can’t help but be charmed and wonder if Minerva is just who he needs to help him solve the mystery of his uncle’s death.  But the more time they spend sleuthing together, the more intense their mutual attraction becomes and soon Chase wants much more than a partner in his investigation.Sidenote: I’d like to point out that the blurb on this one is misleading in that it implies that Chase and Minerva were acquainted previously and he had investigated her before, neither of which was the case.I just couldn’t really get into this one.  I didn’t care much for or about the characters and they felt a bit flat to me.  Minerva annoyed me with her insistence on butting into what was really more of a family matter for Chase, even if there was a slight chance of it affecting her in a fairly roundabout way.  I was a bit confused by the relationship between Chase and Minerva here simply because they had a slight attraction one minute and the next there was love.  Their relationship was shown more than told, which I do like, but in this instance it felt rather one-sided.  I never could quite figure out what exactly was so fascinating about Minerva that had Chase making all these concessions for her when she really treated him rather badly and used him for her own purposes.  I enjoyed the mystery aspects of this book and will likely continue the series to keep up with that.  I wasn’t a huge fan of this one but after reading it I’m looking forward much more to the stories pertaining to the heroes of the next books.  This had the potential to much more ‘unputdownable’ but fell a bit short of that for me.I voluntarily read and reviewed an advanced copy of this book.

73,"This is the first novel I have read by author Cara Black, but it won’t be the last.  “Three Hours in Paris” is a high speed spy novel set in Paris in June, 1940.  In real life, Hitler spent 3 hours in Paris that year, and the author took that event and crafted an exciting adventure with American heroine Kate Rees as a sharpshooter sent to assassinate him.Spoiler alerts from here on: Kate married a Welsh naval officer and together with their 18 month old daughter, were stationed in the Orkney islands.  Kate was an American from the wilds of Oregon, hunting with her dad and brothers.  As an adept markswoman, she worked for the British as a rifle tester, and her skills did not go unnoticed by the covert action department.  After a horrible attack on the base that resulted in the deaths of her husband and daughter, Kate was eventually contacted to be trained as a spy for a very specific mission:  assassinate Hitler.  The mission immediately begins to fall apart when she first parachutes into France.  The story line begins to divide between the German officials who are looking for her, the British covert operatives running the op, and Kate’s ordeals as a hunted spy in occupied Paris.  The reader knows from the very beginning that the assassination attempt fails, and Kate shoots one of the High Command officers instead.  A great twist to the story is the audience learning that Kate has been set up by the British agent to take the fall for the assassination attempt, expecting her to fail and be captured.  She was to be a decoy for the real mission in which  professional snipers were being sent into France to attack a High Command meeting.The German policeman who is first assigned to try to find Kate is a sympathetic character, trying to do his job as a detective but being thrown into internal Nazi politics that thwart him at every turn.  Kate’s cleverness in her escape attempts earn the detective’s respect as a worthy opponent.There also is a traitor in the underground network of the French resistance, which Kate becomes aware of and realizes that she can trust no one even as she depends on them to help her.  Throughout the plot we get snapshots of her spy training and can see what stratagems she uses to change her appearance in order to avoid the Germans.  Then to add even another layer of pressure, Kate stumbles on a dying British spy and learns of his mission, which she decides to complete on her own.Very smooth writing style and fun to read!",5,0,2482,0.11,0
74,"This is one author that I know will have me on the edge of my seat wondering what new twist will send us to new depths.  This book did not disappoint!Tessa is struggling with the fact that she helped free a possible killer and the backlash from filming her documentary about his case.  But is he a killer?  There are many signs that point to yes, but just as many that say no as well.  As the story unfolds we learn the truth and a few twists that maybe we should have expected but still surprised this reader.  On top of this struggle, her mother passes away and now there is the news of her mother's true family history or at least some glimpses into a past that she and her sister never knew about.  And let's not forget the long-standing misunderstanding between Tessa and her sister Margo.  When the truth is finally revealed it was a little bit of a letdown because you had to wonder why they let it fester this long without talking to each other.  Or maybe that is me and knowing how my family would handle a similar situation.As Tessa embarks down the rabbit hole of discovering her true past, so many secrets are revealed that you almost need paper to write down to keep straight.  How did everything come about for her mother?  Who are these new family members?  What are their stories?  We learn more as the book progresses and each chapter is a new delight in knowledge and understanding for the characters and their situations in the past.  I tried to decipher the family on my own but never would have guessed several of the revelations.I was engaged in this book and enjoyed the layout of the chapters that alternated between the past and the present.  It led to the mystery of the story and discovering the truth of Fallbrook and Tessa and Margo's heritage.  Kitty is a sweet octogenarian and has the kindest heart especially once she meets Tessa.  There are many facets to Kitty's actions and words that are slowly revealed throughout the book.  Her sister, Deidre, is more reserved and protective of Kitty and Fallbrook and for good reason but you could see the love she felt for both and why she felt the need to protect them from outsiders.I enjoyed this book and was satisfied with the ending, but I didn't want the story to end and I wanted to discover what happened next for everyone.  I guess my imagination will have to create that additional story in my head!  We give this book 5 paws up.",5,0,2415,0.157,1
75,"I was provided a free ARC by the publisher for an honest review.This second title in The Founders Trilogy series does not disappoint.  All the favorites from the first book, Foundryside, are back; Sancia, Gregor, Berenice, Orso, and (after waiting over half way thru) Clef.Our intrepid heroes are still reeling from the destruction of The Mountain in the first novel, but have a plan to finish off the campo system by twinning all the Michiels scrivings into all the lexicons in the land and provide autonomy to all the citizens Tevanne.  If that sentence confuses the heck out of you, you haven't read the first novel and you will be completely lost trying to start with this one.  That being said, I can only highly recommend you immediately read the first so you can enjoy the second.We pick up with our entertaining quartet 3 years later.  The first third of the book goes quick; there is action, feats of courage, laughably simpleton bad guys and a risk free getaway for our heroes.It all quickly goes downhill for them after that.  An ancient evil being, one of the first to exist (maybe a god?) manages to come back into existence.  He intends to take all of the power of all of the scrivings for himself and rule unchecked over everyone on earth.  But he needs Clef to accomplish this and Sancia still has Clef locked safely away.The bad guy manages to get his hands on Clef and things are looking hopeless.  By the middle third of the book the action pretty much stops and we are treated to soliloquy after soliloquy of the state of mankind, the virtues of free thought, the need to take humanity by the hand and show them the error of their ways, how better off men would be without the power of scrivings helping everything work.  Much as I love this series, I did start to feel I was trudging through a sea of thick mud there for awhile.Finally, in the final third, we are back in action again, there are feats of derring-do, but things look grim for our good guys and they begin to wonder who they can trust.  The ending is everything you could want; uplifting, heartbreaking, hopeful and with just the barest hint of something more to come.  I appreciate an ending like that much more than the usual cliffhanger that just stops mid-action.Much love to this second installment of the series, but again (and I can't stress this enough) you will be completely lost if you haven't read the first in the series.  So please do, it's worth it.",4,0,2450,0.207,0
76,"Mark Lanegan was brave to tell this story, which certainly does not make him look good.  It is full of ""sex and drugs and rock-and-roll,"" as well as violence, and is well told, so it's hard to put down.  Reading one horrifying scene after another, I wondered whether he kept a journal.  There are many vivid events and encounters and I would think might have been a blur.  There are also quite a few hilarious encounters, which lightens the overall heaviness.Another thought I had is that Ellenburg, where Lanegan grew up. is a college town, but he apparently had no interaction with the campus at all.  Given his status as a rebel and cultural outsider who develops a taste for literature and poetry as well as dark, underground music, that surprises me.  (I'm glad to know Lanegan shares my admiration for Cormac McCarthy, and ""Blood Meridian"" in particular.)  Of course it's possible that Central Washington State lacked much of a campus community.  In any event, he hated the town and left as soon as he was able.There are encounters with quite a few well-known musicians, including Kurt Cobain and Layne Staley, both tragically no longer with us, and both good friends with Lanegan.  It turns out he was not into the music of the Screaming Trees at all, and saw the band as his ticket out of town.  He says it was only with ""Sweet Oblivion"" that he wrote some of the lyrics, and that is the one Trees album he thinks was good.  The rest of us have the band to thank for launching Mark Lanegan and making it possible for him to become a singer and a musician.By the end of the book Lanegan has bottomed out, and is a homeless junkie in Seattle.  This section is really hard to read.  He is saved at the very end, which we know since he lived to write the story.The book goes through 1997 or 1998, and does not include the making of his 1998 solo album ""Scraps at Midnight"" or the subsequent final demise of the Screaming Trees, though any Lanegan fan will know that soon followed, and though we have met Josh Homme, there is not yet a Queens of the Stone Age.I am a huge Mark Lanegan fan, and I am amazed at the quality of all of his recent music starting with ""Blues Funeral"" in 2012.  I now have a much better understanding of where he is coming from.  I wish him all the best.Be sure to listen to the album that is something of a soundtrack to the book:  ""Straight Songs of Sorrow.""",5,0,2389,0.152,1
77,"According to author Cara Black, Three Hours in Paris stemmed from a footnote in history.  In June of 1940, Hitler came to newly occupied Paris for three hours.  Only three hours and then left, with no victory parade or fanfare of any kind.  Black says she knew there was more to this and the fact Goebbels, his propaganda minister, and pioneer of faux news, edited the newsreel of Hitler's visit!  And from this little bit of hidden history she has reimagined events and crafted a masterful thriller.Life doesn’t have much meaning for American Kate Rees since she lost her husband and infant daughter in a Luftwaffe bombing, so when she is recruited by British intelligence to put her markswoman skills to use and parachute into Paris and assassinate Hitler she sees her chance for revenge.  Even if she is killed or captured, by killing the Führer she will have achieved a small victory in honor of her dead family.  She is given a crash course in spy craft and put on the plane.  And from that point the story takes off and never slows down until the very last page.The description of the book barely scratches the surface.  There is so much more beneath.Fate, happenstance, (bad) luck, coincidence, whatever it is, nothing is as it seems or goes as expected.  This book is deliciously complicated and convoluted.  It’s as if they are all making connections but the connections are slightly off, and nobody realizes it.  Very exciting, tense, short, short chapters work perfectly because about the time your stress level is at its breaking point the scene or POV shifts.  You get a little breather, but then more suspense.  About halfway through and I still had no idea at all how this might end.  It’s one of those books where you really want to take a peek at the end because you can’t stand it, but you won’t do it because you are enjoying this terrifying ride too much.  There is such a ripple effect of tragedy and ruination to all those Kate innocently touches as she blunders around trying to get back to England, and so many aspects of her mission, and the missions of others, that I just did not see coming.The writing is masterful, characters captivating, and the plot moves along at breakneck pace.  Scenes are brought vividly to life.  You can feel the heat, smell the cigarette smoke, hear the water in the fountains.  Thanks to Penguin Random House for providing an advance copy of Three Hours in Paris.  All opinions are my own.  I thoroughly enjoyed this book and highly recommend it.",5,0,2502,0.092,1
78,"Savage Son is an excellent third novel in the James Reece series by Jack Carr.  Fans of the first two books The Terminal List and True Believer and those who enjoy action packed novels are really going to love this entry into the series.  I feel it is the best written of the three books and the end of Savage Son provides a sand box for James Reece and this series to continue to grow and expand in many potential directions.About a year ago, while waiting for my wife to buy a box of 10,000 Q-Tips at our local Sam's Club, I decided to kill some time and check out the paperbacks.  I saw they had a couple of Mark Greaney's Gray Man novels, a series I had just started to get into, and a book called Terminal List by Jack Carr an author I had never heard of.  When I read the back of the book, it sounded a like a generic special forces novel of which the genre is a bit flooded with, but when I saw author was a first time author who happened to have been a former Navy SEAL with 20 years of experience in the teams, I decided Terminal List might actually be different, fresh, and realistic so I picked up the paperback.  I ended up enjoying Terminal List so much that I excitedly gave my copy to a co-worker who enjoyed the book so much that he passed it on to a family member.James Reece, the main character of the three books, like the author was a Navy SEAL.  This character is unique in this genre because of the level of realism Jack Carr brings to it.  Carr's James Reece, and Mark Greaney's Court Gentry (The Gray Man) are two of the most exciting new characters in thrillers today.  This book and the potential of where the series is heading should put the character of James Reece on the level of other iconic characters of this genre such as Mack Bolan, the Rogue Warrior, Jack Ryan, Mitch Rapp, John Rain, Scott Horvath, and John Wells.  Savage Son should give Jack Carr the level of recognition as writers like Vince Flynn, Brad Thor and Alex Berenson.Savage Son picks up where True Believer left off.  James Reece is recovering from brain surgery in Montana with friend and fellow former SEAL Raife Hastings.  The novel also brings back reporter Katie Buranek who played a major part in The Terminal List but was largely absent from book two.  The book moves forward James Reece's attempt to find and eliminate a traitorous CIA officer who set in motion many of the tragic events from True Believer and was also involved in the death of Reece's father.  Much of the story takes place in either Montana or in Russia.  Some of the parts of the novel take place in Siberia where it is clear the author did a lot of research.Like in the first two novels, Jack Carr's experience as a Navy SEAL adds a level of realism that many novels in this genre lack. The character is so realistic, that the government has censored parts of all three books. Carr led special operations teams and his expertise in tactics, weapons, communication, and intelligence are clearly reflected in the story and in the character of James Reece.  Carr's experience as a officer who led assault and sniper teams in Iraq and Afghanistan translates to very exciting and well written action sequences.One of the main parts of the story in Savage Son is influenced by the famous short story ""The Most Dangerous"" game by Richard Connell about a big game hunter who hunts another big game hunter on an island.  This was a very memorable short story I read as a 9th grader and the whole hunter and hunted works very well with James Reece and the Russian bad guy of the story.  Jack Carr is a big fan of 1980's and 1990's action films and it is clear that films like 1993's ""Hard Target"" with Jean Claude Van Damme and 1994's Ice-T film ""Surviving the Game"" may have also had an influence on the books' hunter and hunted prologue and ending.  I also thought part of the story reminded me a bit of 1983's ""Uncommon Valor"" with Gene Hackman and putting a team together for a rescue mission.There is a cinematic element to Carr's writing that is evident from the prologue which seemed out of a James Bond movie where a different 00 agent meets a tragic fate in the opening scene to the big Steven Seagal like martial arts fight near the end complete with knives and hatchets.  Savage Son reads like action films of Norris, Van Damme, and Seagal.  But, Carr's experience adds a level of realism and authenticity to what could have easily just have been over the top action scenes.  Carr confidently writes about the weapons, the gear, and the technology like no other current author.Carr's story also clearly shows the influence of David Morrell and his novel First Blood and the first two Stallone movies based on his Rambo character.  In fact, one of the reason's I think I enjoy this series so much and Jack Carr's writing is that not only do we enjoy the same 1980's and 1990's action films, but we also enjoyed many of the same writers of that time.  Early in his lengthy acknowledgments, Carr discusses the influence of David Morrell, Tom Clancy, and Nelson DeMille.  These were the same three author's I read the most of in the late 1980's to the mid-1990s.  I first read Hunt for Red October as a 9th grader, I used to devour Morrell's books, and I used to attend all of DeMille's book signings at the Barnes and Noble in Carle Place, Long Island.  In fact, in a couple of places in Savage Son, Carr subtlety pays tribute to Nelson's DeMille's early classic The Charm School.I recently re-read Call of the Wild and saw the film with my son.  While a lot of the attention on Savage Son will focus on the influence of ""The Most Dangerous Game,"" and the hunter and the hunted part of the story.  I think Jack London and what happens to Buck the dog at the end of that story have a big influence on the direction Jack Carr takes James Reece at the very end of the story.  This is part of the story is very important in the continued development of the character of James Reece and I liked how Carr used some of the same themes from Call of the Wild.  As this series continues to grow, the character of James Reece must grow too.My only real criticism of Savage Son is the same criticism I had of Terminal List.  I felt the story was too predictable.  I felt the whole time I read both books I knew where the story was heading and I was correct.  Perhaps this is a side effect of being a fan of the same movies, books, and authors as Jack Carr.  I was constantly excited at Carr's story telling, just never surprised.I really enjoyed Savage Son.  The book was difficult to put down.  It was like a 1980's action movie, but authentic.  It had all the action of the old Chuck Norris, Michael Dudikoff, Steve James Golan Globus Cannon Films of the 80's but at the same time a realism that genre was not known for.  True Believer and Savage Son have added new characters like Raife Hastings, Raife's family, and the Warrior Guardians to the series.  Between these new characters, the re-introduction of previous characters like Katie Buranek, and the events of the epilogue this series has so many interesting directions it can go and such exciting possibilities.  I highly recommend Savage Son and the James Reece books.",4,0,7195,0.138,1
79,"In these times of isolation due to the coronavirus, there could be no more apt title for Rachel Macy Stafford’s latest gift to our hearts than “Live Love Now.”  As we shelter in place, we can’t do much, but we can decide each day to live the day with love.Stafford’s writing doesn’t so much speak to the mind as it does to the heart.  Her words act as a soothing balm to the spirit, a gift held by precious few authors.  In “Live Love Now” Stafford speaks to all of us who fear we are doing life wrong in regards to our relationships, especially in our parent-child relationships.  Like many mothers, I often feel guilt over not bringing my best self to this parenting gig and worry that I am not always the mother my teens need.  Yet Stafford doesn’t speak from a place of rebuke; over and over she models the grace that we can share with our own family.Stafford’s most vital message to every parent is “today matters more than yesterday.”  We can’t erase the mistakes of yesterday, but we can have a fresh start each morning.  With some intentionality, I can put aside my baser nature of criticism and be more loving towards my teens as a Truth-Teller, Encourager, and Guide as outlined in this book.  Stafford says, “Connection is key because listening is love.”  If these times of social isolation have taught us anything, may it be that connection is key.  Stafford’s writing is a primer for forging connection, especially with our teens.Over and over in conversations with teens, Stafford has heard common stressors come up.  The six chapters take up these stressors in turn:  our teens feel unseen & unheard, they experience rejection often, technology can be all-consuming, they lack life skills, they lack coping skills, and they feel pressure both at home and at school.  In the face of these stressors, our teens need us more than ever, even though it may seem like they are trying to shut us out.If we do nothing else with these weeks at home, may we use them to forge stronger connections with those we love most.  Maybe we need this time for a fresh start with our teens.  They desperately need to hear us say three vital truths that Stafford lays out: “No mistake you make is bigger than my love for you” and “You are never alone” and “I love you, just as you are today.”My copy is full of highlights and bookmarks and I promise you that yours will be too if you’ll take the time to soak in the heartfelt guidance that Stafford is offering.",5,0,2455,0.167,1

82,"This was such a fun book!  Girls Save the World in This One is about friendship in small town Georgia and a Zombie Con gone horribly wrong.  June, and her BFFs Imani, and Siggy are looking forward to their first Zombie Con.  They are excited to meet the stars of their favorite show, Human Wasteland, which is about a group of people surviving the Zombie Apocalypse.  The girls are starting their Senior year and are looking forward to spending time together before the real chaos starts.  June is the main character.  She feels less secure than the other two -  not as smart, or as pretty, plus she has a giant zit on her nose.  She's been dumped by her boyfriend - who by the way is dating her other ""best friend,"" Blair.  The three girls are freezing Blair out, but are surprised to see her enter the convention center with a VIP pass to the con.  The three BFFs are having a great time shopping and meeting their idols and looking forward to a photo op with their favorite actor, Hunter Sterling, who place the young surrogate son on the show.  June is wobbling between watching Blair in her second row seat and ogling the cast on the stage when she notices a man in a yellowed T-shirt fiddling with the doors to the convention hall.  More odd behavior follows and soon the girls, the cast and the rest of the attendees are running for their lives from real ""live?"" zombies.  June, who isn't always book smart. turns out to be a great leader and comes up with excellent plans to escape.  The girls end up in a real life survival situation with the actors from the show and other con celebrities.  With the support of her friends and their various skills, June is able to shine and  gain in confidence as long as she can stay alive.I really enjoyed reading this.  I'm a big Walking Dead fan and my daughter has just started going to cons so I could happily relate to this book.  The characters were realistic and charming.  Parsons did a wonderful job describing the cast and crew and showing them as ""real people.""  When the action started, not long into the book, it was exciting, believable and well-plotted.  While it did involve the quick spread of a contagion, the whole zombie aspect makes for an action-packed, very entertaining read.  My middle school readers are going to adore this book - high schoolers will too as will anyone who enjoys fun, friendship and some gory action.  Well done Ash Parsons!!!!",4,0,2417,0.225,0
83,"Ahoy there me mateys!  I absolutely loved this standalone novel.  This novel has great female protagonists, fun evil creatures called kehoks, and some surprising plot twists.  It was such a good reading experience that I didn’t even notice many of the writing inconsistencies until after I finished.  I wanted to stay up all night reading but made meself go to bed.  The author dedicated the book to Tamora Pierce.  She is one of me favorite authors and Durst’s book certainly captures the spirit and feel of those beloved books.Basically there are two main characters, Tamra and Raia.  Tamra is a kehok trainer down on her luck.  Raia is a runaway who decides the kehok races are the only way to earn her freedom.  What is a kehok?  Well, reincarnation is a reality in this society.  A kehok is a person who is so irredeemable that are reborn as murderous tortured monsters who cannot rejoin the reincarnation cycle.  Kehoks are used as racing beasts.  Okay it doesn’t quite make sense but I didn’t care.  Cause monster racing in the desert sounds cool!The highlight for me were the characters.  I loved Tamra and Raia but I grew to love Shalla, Yorbel, and Lady Evara.  I loved that all of them had different reasons for wanting to win the race.  I certainly was cheering them on.  I enjoyed that the characters were from various backgrounds and of various ages.  The races themselves ended up being background for a larger plot about political instability and religion but that ended up being okay because I wanted to see how it all turned out.The world building was the weakest link even if it didn’t ruin the book for me.  The world and politics felt very one dimensional.  The emperor-to-be can’t be crowned until they find the animal housing his dead brother’s soul.  This aspect of the reincarnation didn’t make sense.  There was never any idea of what the point of the cycle was and how ye got out of it.  Good people became animals frequently (and expected to) and so there was some puzzlement once the book was finished.  Many of the plot points of this aspect of the novel were very easy to predict but not all.But really those things were minor in comparison to how much I enjoyed the reading experience and characters.  I certainly need to get back to Durst’s backlog because I had forgotten how much fun her writing could be.I received a copy from the publisher in exchange for me honest musings.

84,"Initially the cover drew me to this book.  It looked like a good, creepy thriller that would keep me on my toes.  But honestly, that isn't quite what I got and I'm not in the least disappointed.  This is the first Jennifer Hillier book I've read but I've noticed she's got a healthy backlist to choose from for future reads.The book opens with Marin and her 4 year old son, Sebastian, in a crowded market place.  It's a situation I've been in myself with a 3.5 year old child.  A bit frazzled, finishing shopping, everything is crowded, your toddler isn't quite into this activity anymore and you're keeping their attention hanging by the sweet promise of a lollipop.  And unfortunately, the more connected we are to our cell phones the less attention we pay to the world around us.  A lesson Marin learns in the worst way possible.  She lets go of her son's hand for a few minutes, tops, and he's gone.  There is no trace of where he is now.  He left the market within minutes of Marin realizing he was missing holding the hand of a Santa Claus and licking that coveted lollipop.Any leads when cold fast and now Marin and her husband find themselves a over a year without their son, drifting apart, sinking in depression and self-destruction.  And then Marin's private investigator finds one more nail in the coffin: Marin's husband, Derek, is sleeping with a pink-haired, slim, 25-year old graduate student and has been for the past six months.Marin's already mired in her downward spiral and this only makes it worse.  You'll be surprised at the depths Marin sinks to but you're compelled to follow her every step of the way.I expected some creepy thriller of some sort.  But this was so much more realistic and engaged me right away.  As a mother of a young child, it's impossible not to immediate relate to Marin and fearfully imagine yourself in her shoes.  What would you do?  Would you go to the extremes Marin does?  How can you really ever know.Additionally, I was kept guessing.  There was a sense of anticipation where I was trying to put some unknown puzzle together during the book.  I didn't quite know what the pieces were, but in the back of my brain, I felt like there was some thread that needed pulled.  This novel was compelling and raw and truthful and darkly honest and I thoroughly enjoyed every page.I will be recommending this one to many, many people and I know the story will stick with me.",5,0,2418,0.146,0
85,"Cara Black's working and walking knowledge of Paris is one of the strong selling points of her books.  While her Aimee Leduc novels are not exactly cozies, they are not fast-paced paced either.  This is a one-off thriller about a potential Htiler assassin.  Since we already know that Hitler survives every single assassination attempt until the end of the war, you already know that this mission is doomed to failure.  But the story is not about the failed mission, it is a character study and an espionage tale.The protagonist, an American civilian with some gun training growing up on the Oregon frontier, is introduced with her family which is killed by an air raid in front of her eyes.  A qualified incident coerces her to take a suicide mission to assassinate Hitler.  From the reader's position, this is as stupid as it sounds, but the protagonist is so blinded by her need to exact what revenge she can that she does not even hestitate to accept irrespective of the obvious questions involved (the first that she asks afterwards is that if the British could shoot Hitler, why send her?).The actual story starts with the failed assassination attempt, and the protagonist trying to figure out what her part in this actually was (and even she figures out immediately that it was not to assassinate Hitler) while trying to escape.  She deals with trust issues, a law enforcement hell-bent on finding her, and her own conflicting thoughts about what she is doing.  Like a good American spy in the Graham Greene tradition, she creates so much of a mess and collateral damage in her wake that it is somewhat unbelievable to me that she was taken alive given the circumstances.The one problematic detraction from the story for me is the stereotype is the preservation of the myth of the good professional German Wehrmacht officer and the cartoonishly sociopathic SS officer in competition, which I am a bit surprised at considering that Vichy France would probably investigate it themselves under German supervision rather than deploy one of their own directly into the field.  This is a bit of a historical error that other books set in the Vichy France take pains to deal with as the French were collaborators as well in the police service (and the degree of that cooperation serves as a tension point in many of those books).  It somewhat detracts from the resolution as it becomes predictable, but the overall story is a good read and a moving thriller.",5,0,2458,0.105,1
86,"In this book, Finney Boylan discusses in a larger sense, her life as it has changed from being a kid into an older adult and how her love of dogs has grown over the years.  She details her first family and individual dogs while being a kid and how those went on to shape not only her as a person but also the love of dogs she continues to harbor in her life.  Finney Boylan raises the important connection between happiness, fulfillment, and having unconditional love regardless of what you look like or what internal struggle you may be going through.  In Finney Boylan's text, dogs are always there for you to love you and give you support.  The stories she tells in this book are so touching and realistic.  We've all known those dogs or been those dog owners who are either our of control or just don't understand what is going on.  There is a very human element in dogs as well as an element that helps reify our humanity.  She says in this book that there are dog people and there are cat people, and I can't agree more.  But there are also people who love both.  As I write this, I have a kitten perched on my shoulder.  Don't mind the fact that she climbed my back with her razor claws, as if I were a rock wall.  Along with her, I love dogs just as much; they are just very different animals.  I feel like what is at the root of Finney Boylan's book is that love is universal.  We all want someone or something to love and everyone and everything out there deserves love regardless of your identity, what species you are, or what you may be going though.This idea is one that isn't directly presented in the book.  You could literally take this book at face value and read a memoir of Finney Boylan's life in conjunction with the dogs she has owned or had in her family.  You could also read this a bit deeper, as an expose on love and appreciation.  I think she makes some pretty strong statements in this book about love and belonging and how dogs (especially) can show us those two hard-to-grasp concepts, quite easily.  While cats sometimes do this, dogs pretty much represent love and affection; they are the embodiment of these sentiments.  I love that Finney Boylan chose dogs for this memoir and found a way to honor those she and he has loved thorough their life and the lessons they were taught through being a pet owner and lover.",5,0,2350,0.263,1
87,"This is a lighthearted romance during the time when women obeyed their parents and then their husbands, and they absolutely were never to be found alone on a balcony at a ball.I enjoyed both Violet and James.  Their relationship started off with a bang and then fast forward five years and we learn that it also ended with one as well.  With a beginning that was hot and steamy, filled with so much passion in and out of the bedroom, this couple now find themselves living in a cold place with very little interaction between them.  When an event occurs that sets Violet down the path of wifely fury, the past four years show to be very pale indeed.’He’d meant to needle her, annoy her, but always maintain the upper ground – and yet, when she was looking at him like that, really looking at him without any of the distance that had spread between them, it was all he could do to keep his hands at his sides, to resist the temptation to reach out, pull her to him, and kiss her senseless.’Violet was the opposite of what society dictated.  She’s forthright and outspoken and while she doesn’t scandalize society, if they could see the real her, she would surely be ostracized.  James has seen the real her and he loved everything about her.  The fact that he wanted no other woman made me love him.’Before he had met Violet, he would have said that he enjoyed kissing, that it was a diverting stop on the road to greater pleasures.  But with violet, kissing was not merely a stop along a well-trodden path.  It was a destination all its own.’This is filled with plenty of fun arguing and banter as well as other characters that added humor to the already ridiculous situation this couple had worked themselves into.  The steam level is low and this is a very slow burn until James and Violet finally give in to their desires and then, holy heck, they proved this wasn’t my momma’s historical romance.While I’m not an expert on what is true or not during the era this was written for, I found it to be very realistic.  With plenty of descriptions and the inner thoughts of this hero and heroine, I found myself swept up into their time and place.Overall, this was a very enjoyable read and while I did skim a bit of descriptions and inner-logue towards the end, and would have loved to have received an epilogue, I was quite satisfied at the end.",4,0,2345,0.189,0
88,"I received an ARC of Fake Truth from the publisher/Net Galley in exchange for my honest review, and at first, I was a bit doubtful, because I was aware of Goldberg mainly as the author of the Monk mystery series, which somehow just didn’t click with me.  But after reading this book, I’m really glad I read it.Fake Truth is built on the idea that thriller writer Ian Ludlow keeps coming up with fictional terrorism ideas that turn out to come true.  These include small things – like early in the story when Ian comments on the irony that the CIA has a safe house in Syria, Virginia, and then wonders if the CIA also has safe houses in Moscow, Maryland and Lebanon, Pennsylvania; only to find out that in fact, it does.  And his penchant for dreaming up “true” fictional terrorist plots also includes big things – but if I described those in this review, they would be spoilers!  It’s a device that has been used before, but Goldberg does it really well.Goldberg also has a nice touch for the zany, so that I laughed out loud more than once while reading this book, which is rare for me.  I also liked the way the characters bounced around the world, so that I got to see some places I have visited, which is always fun, and some I haven’t been to, which is also fun.  And, I liked the political timeliness of it all, and was amused by Goldberg’s comment in his acknowledgements section at the end that some days he had to decide “whether to re-plot [his] story so that [his] fiction would still be fiction, or to just keep going, reality be damned”.The only downside I felt in the book was that I just never warmed up to the character of Wang Mei.  I don’t know if it might have helped if I had read the first two books in the series first.  Mostly, I didn’t feel at a disadvantage not having read the series in order, since Goldberg does a pretty good job of filling in background, but maybe if I had “met” Wang Mei before, I might have liked her more now.  All-in-all, though, I really enjoyed Fake Truth a lot, and now plan to go back and read the first couple of books in the series.Please note that I tend to be pretty conservative in awarding stars, only giving five stars to maybe one in thirty or forty books, and this is one of them.  And my thanks again to the publisher and NetGalley for the review copy!",5,0,2316,0.185,1

Marin tells Chloe and for some reason, Chloe freaks out on her.  They hardly talk after that.  Bex kissing Marin has opened her eyes a bit.  She now starts seeing how girls are treated differently than boys.""Be flirty but not too flirty.  Be confident but not aggressive.  Be funny but in a low-key, quiet way.  Eat cheeseburgers, but don't get fat.  Be chill, but don't lose control.""After yet another girl is humiliated over the dress code and the list of approved authors are all white men, Marin decides to start a feminist book club at school.  The group isn't big, but they all bond over reading and trying to see ways that there is sexism and racism all around them.  Marin also starts spending time with Gray, a cute boy who joins her group.  Bex decides to get revenge on Marin and her story comes out to the whole school.  Instead of being concerned, people just laugh at her.  Marin is dealing with the stress of her grandma losing her memory, too.  So one day, Marin snaps.There is a lot about friendship, family, love, school, and how different people are treated in different ways.  It's definitely a book that I hope both girls and boys will pick up and read.  The only way to help change is to educate.Warnings for inappropriate relationships, sexism, teenage drinking, Alzheimers, teens being asses and making inappropriate comments, including about emotions and periods.I gave this book 4 1/2 stars rounded up to 5.

90,"Widowhood hasn't brought the freedom it should have for Lady Julia Fairbright.  Though she mourned her husband, theirs was largely a marriage of convenience, but their elopement displeased her father-in-law, the Duke of Sprogsfield, and now, if she wants to stay with her son, Julia must abide by the duke's staunch rules of propriety.  When she meets handsome adventurer, Garrett Stockton, Julia finds a stir of attraction she'd thought long dead, but the only way she'll ever have the freedom to pursue her own happiness, without losing her son, is if she can prove to the rest of society just how deplorable the duke really is behind his pious facade.As the distant relation of an earl, Garrett Stockton has been welcomed to cling to the fringes of society, but unlike his father, Garrett was not content to depend on the charity of distant relatives for his living and instead delved into the institution scorned by the aristocracy: trade.  Now the owner of a successful shipping company and exceedingly wealthy, Garrett remains somewhat of an enigma to society.  Rumors constantly circulate about his roguish tendencies and reckless wanderings, but Garrett is thinking increasingly more about settling down and remaining in England, especially after he meets a lady whose thirst for independence matches his own.  A light-hearted flirtation rapidly evolves into true feelings and soon Garrett is ready to claim Julia and her son as his own and determined to help her attain her freedom from a life under the duke's thumb.This book started out so very strong and I was tearing right through it and then somewhere around the 60% mark it just lost steam and became rather discombobulated.  The characters were decently likable, the villain detestable, but the heroine quickly became rather vapid for me and the love scenes were extremely tame.  Some scenes toward the end drug out too much and seemed irrelevant  to the storyline, at least the story between Garrett and Julia.  We mostly have instalove here with Garrett falling much harder for Julia than she did for him and I mostly felt like she was using him for much of the book and stringing him along, even after the threat of the duke was removed.  I also felt like this was handled a bit too quickly as well.  This was a fine read to pass the time, but nothing to really write home about.I voluntarily read and reviewed an advanced copy of this book.  All thoughts and opinions are my own.",3,0,2450,0.165,0
91,"When I was a teenager working at my first part-time job in a 5 and dime store, I found myself gravitating towards the senior ladies who worked there.  I found them much more interesting to talk to.  Perhaps that's why I was drawn to this book.  It centers upon a small group of elderly people that reside in an assisted living facility called Centennial.An 88 year old chap named Duffy Sinclair is the main character and narrator of the story.  He is a Vietnam Veteran and recovering alcoholic.  He shares a room with Carl, and his dearest wish is that they'll end out their last days together just as they are.  His major concern is that he will lose basic functions and mobility which would necessitate him getting booted from Centennial and sent to Simmons Nursing Home...the end of the line.  He's quite content at Centennial, and he felt a warm vibe when he first toured the place.  He also is extremely fond of a fellow resident, Alice.  She's delicate, pretty and genteel, and is loyal to the memory of her deceased husband Arthur.  Duffy keeps his hankering for Alice on the down low, as well as his past struggle with alcoholism.The character of Josie literally bursts onto the scene through Duffy and Carl's room window, at the beginning of the book.  Young and pretty, wearing a barmaid's apron and a short skirt, she turns the lives of these two men upside down inside of a week.  Carl has a huge secret he's been keeping and Josie's entrance into his life causes a big reveal.Josie brings some personal problems into the mix which Duffy acutely understands.  In trying to help her, he risks his own well-being and strains his friendship with roommate Carl.  Josie's plight became the major focal point of the book, but I did not make an emotional connection with this character.  For that reason, my investment in the story became rather sluggish, and this was just an ""OK"" read.  I would have enjoyed the story more if it focused entirely on the residents, exploring their wisdom, nostalgia and fears as they navigated the twilight of their lives.My favorite parts of the book were the chapter headings which consisted of the schedule for the day at the facility.  I actually thought the various itineraries were delightful!  My other favorite part of the book (ironically) was the very end.Thank you to Berkley / Penguin Publishing Group for providing an advance reader copy via Edelweiss.",3,0,2404,0.119,0
92,"David Baldacci has many positive qualities in his profession of writer of novels.  Possibly the most outstanding of these is his ability to create a wide variety of characters for his books and make them come alive.  He has the knack to hold onto the various natures assigned and keep them reacting in the unique manner such types would always exhibit.  ""Walk the Wire"" brings together two different sets of the characters created.  The first group involves Amos Decker and his partner Alex Jamison.  Decker is a huge bear of a man; tall and weighing close to 300 pounds.  He began a career as a pro football player but was injured in a practice.  Physically knocked into a coma he finally came to and found that he had somehow gained a photographic memory as well as distorted views of various colors.  He uses his unusual skills to advantage in his job as an FBI agent.  The other set of characters are Will Robie  and Jessica Reel.They both are professional assassins employed by the U.S. government and very skillful in their work.  One of the novels featuring Will and Jessica had them meet when each was in receipt of an order to kill the other.  Great way to start a relationship right.  Amos and Alex are sent to the town of London, North Dakota to investigate a murder.  London is at the center of the oil drilling industry known as fracking and due to the boom this industry has created is very much in the wild character of  Alaskan towns during the gold rush of the 19th century.  A young woman was killed and than literally autopsied and left in an open field  with her entrails outside the body.  It appeared that whoever did the job knew how to do an autopsy.  While horrible in it's aspect Amos wonders why two FBI agents were assigned to look into the killing when it should have really fallen into the jurisdiction of the local police.  Trust Baldacci to supply some fascinating answers.  He incorporates the arrival of Robie and Reel with the existence of an air force base watching for missiles launched by enemies of the U.S., the private preserve of a cult, and two wealthy individuals fighting for more and more property in the boom town.  More murders with a slew of suspects and the other factors mentioned create the typical David Baldacci book one fine all nighter. and of course a five star novel.",5,0,2325,0.104,1
93,"This book is the third in a series by Jack Carr, and is an excellent novel.  This was the first book in the series that I have read, and I would suggest to other readers to read the books in order of publication as these stories about the adventures of James Reece build upon each other.To put it into perspective, although I was not even through reading this novel, I went ahead and ordered the first two books in the series from Amazon (The Terminal List and True Believer).  The early part of this book spends a good deal of time bringing the reader up to speed on the actions covered by the first two books.In this novel we follow our ""hero"" James Reece, a former Seal and CIA Ground Branch operator as he recovers from injuries sustained in the action described in the prior novels, and then sets out on his quest to find (and eliminate) those that had attacked his family and those who he hold dear.There is plenty of action and political intrigue for even the most diehard fan of this type of novel.The author writes in a style and with knowledge that shows he has ""been there and done that"".  Also, I enjoy the fact that Carr mentions in great detail the arms, equipment, clothing, and accessories used by those about whom he writes.  Plenty of accurate hardware descriptions, with none of the stupid errors one encounters when such books are written by good authors, but who do not have a clue as to actually load a gun, much less fire it.  (How many of such books does one need where a ""silencer"" is screwed onto a revolver, or for that matter where the ""safety"" on a revolver is ""clicked off"", or where some other piece of gear is not properly described or used.  This is not such a book.)There are a couple of errors which missed the proofing process (I read the advance copy, so maybe these were caught in the final proofing - but, I doubt it.)  Once in a negative sentence, the writer uses ""or"" rather than the proper ""nor"" and in another the author uses the singular ""was"" when he should have used the plural ""were"".  For some reason the automatic proof reading programs just do not catch these types of errors.  But in a book of nearly 400 pages, I only caught two of these types of errors, which is well below average.Overall, a superb novel, a great set of characters, and a good plot.  Five stars and well worth reading.",5,0,2339,0.111,1
94,"Redhead by the Side of the Road is a delightful read, a classic Anne Tyler novel.  As usual, it is set in Baltimore, and this particular narrative is about Micah Mortimer, a solitary man who runs his own one-man company fixing computers.  He keeps to himself and is set in his ways.  Other than his family and his girlfriend Cass, he runs into people only when he is called to fix their computers or when he is doing his other job as building superintendent.  He likes this because socializing is not his thing.Micah is a creature of habit.  Every day is scheduled for a specific task and his apartment is always neat and tidy.  Every morning at 7:15, he goes for a run and hence the book's title.  Because Micah's eyesight is less than average, he often mistakes red fire hydrants for redheads at the side of the road.  He has a nice girlfriend named Cass who is a school teacher and he has a large and loving family with whom he occasionally socializes.Everything seems to run like clockwork in Micah's life until two mishaps occur.  Cass is subletting her apartment and the apartment's primary renter wants it back.  Cass has a cat and can't find another place to live right away.  Instead of inviting Cass to live with him until she can find a place, Micah lets Cass deal with this problem on her own, acting complacent and uncaring.  Eventually, this leads to her breaking up with him which appears to be the story of his life - women leaving him.Then there is the unexpected knock on his door, a teenager who has run away from home looking for his biological father.  For some reason, he thinks Micah may be the man he is looking for.  This leads to a comedy of errors and Micah's involvement with the boy's family and his reuniting with his college girlfriend.  The story is told in the sensitive and tender manner that separates Anne Tyler's writing from the scores of others who would tell this narrative with a heavy hand.As Micah tries to navigate his life with these two upheavals, he gains insight and realizes that being so rigid in his daily self-expectations may not be the best choice for him.  He needs to loosen up a bit, allow for error and accept himself in a kinder and more essential way.  He is more than what he does, he is a man with emotions that distinguish him as a unique and special person.",4,0,2321,0.088,0
95,"""There's a man with a gun over there/telling me I've got to beware.What a field day for the heat/a thousand people in the streetsSinging songs and carrying signs/getting so much resistance from behind.""  -- Buffalo Springfield, ""For What it's Worth"" 1967On Monday, May 4, 1970 the world changed.  The  Ohio National Guard shot several people, killing four students and nine other innocent bystanders.  This particular book takes readers down the painful path of the first four days in May of 1970 when unrest and violence on the streets in the area prompted the then mayor to order that the bars be closed early so as to prevent an upsurge in the unrest and violence.What makes this book distinct is that it is narrated in a very loose, flowing, lyrical and poetic style.  The writing style stands in stark contrast to the violence and animosity that underscored the Kent State Massacre.  The Massacure took place during an anti war demonstration wherein students faced off the ROTC.  (Reminds one of Imre Nagy staring down the Russian tanks and attacks some 15 years earlier in 1954.)  Readers get to view the Massacre through the lenses of those who have lent their voices to the mix.  Readers also get to experience the range of emotions that the Massacre created.  The book captures the voices of witnesses as well as those close to the people who were shot, casualties and survivors alike.News photographer John Filo's world renowned photograph of Mary Ann Vecchio, 14 weeping in anguish over the Michigan State University transfer student Jeffrey Miller right after he was shot and killed is intense.  That photograph earned Filo a Pulitzer prize and is an important permanent part of history.  The photograph evokes strong emotions as does the narratives which paint the picture into sharper focus.Neil Young's famous song ""Ohio"" was an outgrowth of the 1970 Kent State Massacre.  Many artists lent their voices and talents to the events on that campus in 1970.  So many songs that predate as well as post date the tragic series of events are startlingly a propos then and now.""Where Have All the Flowers Gone,"" Pete Seeger and others 1961""The Times They Are A Changing,"" Bob Dylan, Peter Paul & Mary and others, 1963""Eve of Destruction,"" Barry McGuire 1965""I Ain't Marching Any More"", Phil Ochs 1965""Seven O'Clock News/Silent Night,"" Simon & Garfunkel 1966""For What it's Worth,"" Buffalo Springfield 1967""War!

96,"Ms. G. seems in her life to have internalized the ideas that women should look great at all times, to keep slim, well-dressed and beautiful for a man, to be an orderly housekeeper with awesome closets, a place for everything, everything in its place.  'Donna Reed tv show' stuff.  Although she rattles on about 'womens lib' and 'womens opportunities' and 'women can do it all -  no matter our size or what we look like - we should love ourselves as we are', it is as if she's fighting a battle with herself.  One part wants to be that liberated modern woman (which sounds so old-fashioned) ;  the other half is grossly ashamed of wanting to be so.  That other half thinks being perfectly coordinated and made up is vitally important.  She is still annoyingly obsessed with her looks, seems to think all other women are rivals, watching, comparing, trying to measure up,  and never quite doing so.  Nit pick nit pick nit pick, obsessed with makeup and clothes and shoes and boots .  And OMG yet another agonizing interminable chapter on the dreaded swimsuit shopping!  Trying on suit after suit and finding fault with everything, self-hatred ballooning out of her psyche as much as her perceived cellulite bulging out of the swimsuit.  (Hey, dumbazz:  why don't you try on a suit that FITS?  She leaves in a huff, empty-handed, because she was once a size 4,  thinks she is still a size 4 and will not, no, not EVER EVER put on something in a larger size!) .  She rails against men ""who have it so easy - shower and put on clothes, the end.  Not like us stressed out women with 40 pairs of shoes!""  She also seems to have a dithering poor relationship with her justifiably annoyed daughter....The point of all this?  If you like the Cathy strip,  nod and sigh at wickedly designed swimsuits, spend much of your life at the mall searching for perfection, and angry about men who just don't understand why women put themselves through agonies trying to finding it - then you will like this book.  I found it annoying, tiresome, and thinking she should have seen a psychiatrist decades ago so she could relax and enjoy life a little......I did like the chapters on dealing with her parents, they are very elderly, set in their ways, but still sharp.  In spite of her efforts to 'make their lives easier', they never change from who they were all their lives.  (Just as Cathy will never change, either).",2,0,2398,0.094,1
97,"What an ugly book this was.  According to Lewis, in the course of this play Hamlet and his creator work through the goods of humanism, discarding and rubbishing each of them as they go: “Hamlet turns to moral philosophy, love, sexual desire, filial bonds, friendship, introversion, poetry, realpolitik, and religion in the search for meaning or fixity.  In each case, it discovers nothing of significance.”  The play apparently demonstrates that the humanist project is a ""sham,"" both in the view ""that history is a repository of wisdom from which human societies can and should learn"" and in ""the conviction that the true value of human life could best be understood by a return ad fontes—to the origins of things, be they historical, textual, moral, poetic, philosophical, or religious.”  The upshot, apparently, is that Hamlet is a nihilistic hero, and Shakespeare a nihilist.  The venatorial imagery, the language of hunting, that floods the play indicates, Lewis tells us, that this is an eat-or-be-eaten world.  If the thesis holds, it becomes difficult to believe that Shakespeare could have gone on to create more plays, let alone the restorative late plays.James Shapiro and Jonathan Bate, two leading Shakespeareans, have both written scathing reviews of this study in The New York Review of Books and The Times Literary Supplement, although the generously nipped-and-tucked quotations in the editorial reviews section above might lead you to think otherwise.  A baffled Shapiro, for example, writes that, “We are also left in the dark about Lewis’s own turn against a humanist tradition in which he is so steeped; most scholars with this much Latin and Greek end up celebrating humanist culture, not exposing it as fraudulent”; Shapiro predicts that “Lewis and his antihumanist approach to Hamlet, though it suits our moment, will, I suspect, win over very few adherents, at least in the short term.”The field of literary inquiry is in a very sorry state if this is the best that Shakespeare scholarship can do.  Is Professor Lewis reading Shakespeare, or is Professor Lewis reading Professor Lewis?  A larger question is what will the rising generation be learning from their teachers if, according to them, everything means nothing?  ""Woe to the Humanities.""  Small surprise that the Humanities is experiencing a crisis in North America and that students are opting instead for vocational degrees.  If Lewis is right and this is indeed Hamlet, then I don’t think much of it.",1,4,2487,0.136,1
98,"I read all 3 books in about 10 days so this review is as much for The Last Emperor as it is for the whole trilogy.Basically, I really liked the overall story.  It's not the best or worst space opera I've ever read; generally pretty solid with a few issues I'll explain later.  If you like Scalzi's other work, then I think you'll in general be pretty happy with it.  The dialog was typical Scalzi with plenty of humor and wit.  Yes, some characters will use strong language like some adults often do.  If that offends you, this series won't do you any favors.Most of the characters are pretty easily categorized as ""good"" or ""evil"" although I suppose there is one character in particular who runs closer to neutral.  I would appreciate more nuanced characters who don't fit into simple one sentence description buckets/stereotypes.  That said, characters mostly felt like well thought out players adapting to changing situations and planing their next move in a complex game of survival- good dialog IMHO helps tremendously with this.But if you want to write a space opera and get 5 stars from me you got to do more than that.  Execution matters too.  As good as the dialog is, there is a lot of exposition which really started to annoy me.  An entire chapter dedicated to describing what the 99.9% of the universe is experiencing seems to only exist to be filler for what I can only imagine is some minimum number of pages required by the publisher.  This chapter in particular really annoyed me, not just because of the exposition, but because it literally added nothing to the story.  We never meet anyone who is even close to a commoner in this universe- everyone is wealthy and usually has a position of great power- the 0.1%.  All of a sudden we're supposed to wonder what a butcher or baker is supposed to think about the end of the universe as they know it?  Why am I supposed to care about these nameless people on worlds I've never heard of?  After reading the chapter, I still didn't care if or how billions of people died.So if something like Dune or Hyperion gets 5 stars, then this is something around 3.5.  I went back and forth a lot deciding between 3 or 4 and ended up flipping a coin.  Heads.  4 stars.  Sorta wondering if I should do best out of 3?",4,0,2268,0.144,0

Each wife had given him a child.  His daughter, Catherine, was compromised by a rake during her debut resulting in a pregnancy.  She died giving birth to her son, Cian.  His other daughter, Diana, simply wants to care for the baby as she had promised her sister and whom she loves dearly.  However, her father insists that she be presented at court and she will marry the man he has chosen for her.  After which, he will take the inheritance her grandmother had left for her.  They will take Cian with them to London and her father will place the child in an orphanage.  They will be accompanied by her arrogant brother, Percival, who had been slightly wounded in the war, but who still unnecessarily carries a cane.Lieutenant Evan Eldridge is convalescing in the hospital from wounds he received in the war.  He is still plagued with nightmares.  The son of a vicar, he simply wants to get well and rejoin his troops.  When the Home Secretary comes to visit him, he is surprised.

The man is Percival Seaton even though Evan doesn’t remember the incident.At court, Diana is presented to the Queen and the Prince Regent awards Evan the title of Earl of Whitelock, Viscount Sharingham, plus lands and holdings.  Evan is shocked by this and meets Diana and her brother, Percival who weakly thanks Evan for saving him.

Included are recipes using several different cooking techniques such as fast prep comfort foods, which many of us are looking for just now, skillet and sheet pan dinners, and recipes for use in an Instant Pot  Saltzman incorporates a plethora of tips on ways to adapt the recipes for a variety of diets including dairy free, vegan, vegetarian, gluten free, grain free, and nut free.  Quicker Than Quick has the added value of her techniques for repurposing recipes, suggestions for alternatives when you don't have ingredients in your pantry, and her ideas about how to use leftovers creatively.  Only one thing is missing from the recipes in Quicker Than Quick, but it's an important one.  No nutritional information is provided for any of the recipes.  This information should be included for every recipe in every cookbook claiming, as this one does, to offer ""healthy"" recipes.Quicker Than Quick has chapters on:  Breakfast  Salads  Soups  Appetizers  Vegetable Sides  Starchy Sides  Mains  Instant Pot, and  Dessert.lEspecially helpful for less experienced cooks are chapters on cooking basics and pantry staples.  A Kitchen Calculator is appended to assist in making substitutions, as is a list of recommended kitchen equipment.Of the recipes I've tried, two in particular, are standouts:  Roasted Red Pepper Pesto on Grilled Flatbread and Chinese Style Sauteed Green Beans.  Nothing I've tried has been less than delicious; the dishes have been packed with flavor and texture and have been as appealing to the eye as to the stomach.  I can't wait to try more!  I am especially intrigued by Saltzman's Instant Mason Jar Soups, to which you add bgoiling water for an Instant meal on the go.Quicker Than Quick is both a fun and informative cookbook to read and to cook from.  I suggest taking the time to read (or at least skim) the entire volume; there is much to learn here.  Moreover, the accompanying color photographs of nearly every recipe are gorgeous in their own right, as well as showing how the dishes should look plated.  The recipes, tips, and techniques for quicker, healthier cooking will make a fine addition to the kitchen library of anyone who enjoys cooking, but will be a special treat for those cooking for their own or others' dietary restrictions.

101,"I should start with this: I appreciate Dave Rubin insomuch as his talk show, ""The Rubin Report,"" arrived at an opportune time in my life.  Although his whole ""it's about IDEAS"" line has turned into a lazy trope, there's something to be said of how a former Young Turks commentator changing his mind on crucial political topics resulted in multiple burnt bridges as a result.  Whether this was done for more lucrative opportunities or genuine self-reflection is a suspicion some have raised; and if it's indeed the latter, this book doesn't really help his case.Likes:I should say that I connected most with the personal details he provided.  His struggles ranging from coming out while in college (if I recall), his marriage, and alopecia caused by intense amounts of stress are the best portions.  I still think connecting coming-out stories with both homosexuality & being a conservative is rather tasteless; then again, the heightened fallout Dave received did enough to make me step back and reconsider his unique situation.  Overall, the personal side of this book are bright spots I constantly welcomed while reading.Dislikes:I'm just...not on the same wavelength with his comedy.  I hear he does stand-up on the side, but I'm not convinced that's his forte.  Imagine your dad rifling through the ""naughty"" jokes, but even more stilted in his delivery.  That's how the majority of comedic lines came.  Maybe a quick smile here or there, but more wince-inducing if keeping a tally.  Sorry to say, Dave.A lot of it comes off as milquetoast compared to several of the great thinkers on his show.  There's also factual inaccuracies and half-truths that bob up here and there.  I have absolutely no idea how the Ukraine nukes/NATO claim made it past the publisher.  This isn't to say I find his guidelines as a whole heinous; only that it's piggy-backing off denser, more introspective work that gave me pause.  Here: the argumentation & prose reads more like 'classical liberal' comfort food.In sum, this half-political essay/half-personal account adds up to something I can't recommend.  Even ardent fans of The Rubin Report can get most of what he's saying within select YouTube videos.  I still give credit for his impeccable timing of his show's origin and some new people he introduced me to, but I wish he made something that got close to their material.  His demand to not burn this book will likely be respected simply out of forgetting its existence.",2,0,2461,0.108,0

It was an easy read and her imagery is great.  It brings you right to tropical warm Key West, a welcome daydream when you live in the North and it still snows on and off through April.She also peppers her novel with Spanish.  I thought she did this so smoothly, sometimes when authors utilize a second language in their books they end up sounding like a dictionary or juvenile as they immediately translate for their reader.  But Oliveras uses context clues and smooth prose to explain without tearing you away from the story.The story shows many different kinds of people and families.  It shows togetherness and growth and it shows overcoming hurts and obstacles.  We don't get to pick our family, but sometimes we can pick how we interact with them and that can make a world of difference.If you're looking for an escape into a romantic fling, this is the perfect fit!",4,0,2360,0.157,0

She is now in the senior years of her life, having retired just the year before as a teacher.  She is trying to grasp her relatively new reality of both being retired and becoming a widow almost virtually at the same time.  You see, her husband Sam died while in transit to take Antonia to her celebratory retirement dinner last year.  He was a physician, well known for being very kind, and passionate about helping people.As Antonia navigates her new solitary life, she often ""hears"" her husband's voice telling her what he would think or do in certain situations, and this can often influence how she will decide to handle them.  It's a learning curve how this ""afterlife"" flows around and through us.There are two areas of conflict weaving throughout this story.  One involves Mexican illegal aliens who are seeking help from Antonia.  She is well versed in shepherding resources in the area due to her late husband's interest in this plight, but is uncertain how far she should stick her neck out.  Still, she has internalized her husband's voice and spirit which plays into her decision making.The other area of concern is with her sister Felicia Isabel Vega aka ""Izzy"".  They've almost felt like twins throughout life because they were born less than a year apart, and they are the oldest.  However, Izzy is wont to be flamboyant and impetuous, and her sisters have always feared she has bipolar disorder.  They have been trying an intervention for years to get Izzy professional help to no avail, but things are hitting a crisis point...and just when the sisters are trying to get together to celebrate Antonia's 66th birthday.The writing was good, but I disliked the passages that were somewhat poetic-and frankly went a bit over my head.  It was like word salad...and I wasn't going to stop and do the work to analyze its higher meaning.  When I read I like it to be a pleasant, restful exercise and for it to flow effortlessly; nice and easy.  I also wasn't that drawn into the sister interaction track of the story.

104,"Not to give you a spoiler right off the bat, but I’m not a fan of “monster” or “horror” science fiction.  This book kind of fits into those categories, but you may have a different opinion.The UNES Forerunner One is one of three Earth colony ships to be launched around 2072 for a new system called Trappist-1.  It’s now 2150 AD and Forerunner One is approaching its destination.  Obviously, the entire crew hasn’t been active the entire trip.  No, they were in cryo-sleep for most of the journey.  Select members of the crew were on duty for up to two weeks at a time monitoring systems and making sure things were going as planned.  Captain Clayton Cross also did his duty shift using going into cryo-sleep for upto six months and then on duty for two-weeks.  On the trip out to Trappist-1, it was comfortingly boring.No one is exactly sure what they will find in the new system.  This is a colony ship so they do hope to find and settle on one of the planets in the Trappist system.  There are about three such planets in the “Goldilocks” zone, an area around the star capable of sustaining human life.  They have chosen to land on Trappist-1E.  The Captain and the Executive Officer will be in the initial landing party.  This pretty ridiculous, but pretty standard for science fiction books!Aboard Forerunner One is Richard Morgan, Ambassador for the United Nations of Earth.  Technically, he was in charge of this mission although he wasn’t in the military.  Captain Clayton didn’t like this arrangement, but as long as the Ambassador stayed out of his way, he could work with it.  The Ambassador did insist that he be part of the initial landing party in case they did meet an intelligent species for which the Ambassador was would make first contact.The landing party landed and started exploring the dense jungle of Trappist-1E.  What they find there is not going to go well.  It even results in Forerunner One getting chased out of the Trappist-1 system by unknown aliens.  So, Earth or humans have had their first contact.  Now Captain Clayton has not choice but to return to Earth and warn humanity of what he has found.He only hopes it’s not too late.

105,"I recently received my copy of this cookbook!  Beautiful.  Not only that, but I already love some of the recipes in it and am eager to try the rest!  Jeffrey Eisner of Pressure Luck Cooking (website, YouTube videos, Facebook page, etc.) first came to my attention when I first got my Instant Pot Duo Plus a couple of years ago.  I looked at the instructions that came with the pot, which overwhelmed me, and so I did a search for a how-to video.  Jeffrey's was the first one to catch my attention, and that one video gave me total confidence to use my IP!  That led to me looking at and subscribing to his videos, webpage and Facebook page!  Jeffrey himself is a treasure of a person and so down to earth and fun!  His attitude and slogan is ""If Jeffrey can do it, you can do it.""  And it is absolutely true.  When it arrived, my husband grabbed the book to write down specific recipes he'd like me to try!  And I'm already making many of Pressure Luck Cooking's recipes.  Jeffrey has been featured on TV shows!  Perhaps one day he'll have his own!  I wouldn't be at all surprised!  But regardless, he's already a superstar!  Someone said in a review that his recipes aren't necessarily easy, and what they mean is there appear to be a lot of ingredients, but that's primarily true of spices and additions...not of the core ingredients.  And I have found with IP cooking, the more you can have prepped and ready to go in advance, the cooking is fast and a breeze...and allows cleanup during cooking of the bowls and tools you may dirty in prepping!

106,"Nathaniel Rothmere, known as the Duke of Rothhaven, is a notorious, yet respected recluse among Yorkshire society.  He eschews social interaction, only leaving his estate for reckless gallops across the moors in the fading light.  Despite his fearsome reputation, Nathaniel is a truly good man, which is why he must turn away the lovely young woman demanding his help with navigating the treacherous world of English high society.Lady Althea Wentworth grew up in abject poverty and is distinctly unimpressed by titles, but since her brother unexpectedly inherited a dukedom she has been thrust into a society that is determined to mock and exclude her.  She seeks the advice of the reclusive neighborhood duke in an effort to learn how to make society respect her on her own terms, shattering the reclusive duke’s privacy.  He tries to keep her at bay, but she won’t be so easily dissuaded and soon they realize they’re both pretending to be other than what they truly are and they have more in common than either could’ve imagined.I loved this book.  I found it to be charmingly witty and at times both hilarious and poignant.  I loved the growth of the relationship between Althea and Nathaniel and their wholehearted acceptance of each other.  Their banter was delightful and I especially enjoyed the secondary characters and the repartee between Nathaniel and Stephen.  I loved how protective Nathaniel and Althea were of each other and their relationship, though more on the sensual side, worked here.  The characters were well-drawn and I could really feel Nathaniel’s loneliness and frustration and cheered at Althea’s growth and determination on her journey to accepting herself.  I loved Nathaniel as a sweet yet tragic hero trying desperately to keep everything together and Althea was just what he needed.  I loved that the characters felt raw and real and I was sucked right into their world any time I picked up this book.  My only wish was that there had been an epilogue just to solidify their happy ending, though they did still have quite a few legal challenges to overcome and I can see not wanting to step on the toes of the next book.  I need to go back and read the other books in this series, but I can’t wait for Robbie’s story.I voluntarily read and reviewed an advanced copy of this book.  All thoughts and opinions are my own.",5,0,2352,0.242,0
107,"Deon Meyer is back with a great thriller!  Benny Griessel and his partner, Vaughn Cupido are ensnared in a case that has an ex-cop, Johnson Johnson, thrown off a train.  Was it murder, an accident or suicide?  Things just don't add up and the case ends up having tendrils that travel far from South Africa where it began.Benny and Vaughn are both in the HAWKS, the elite South African police unit.  They are good complements to one another.  Vaughn has a quick wit and is more familiar with how the social structure of things work.  Benny is a recovering alcoholic who spends his free time playing in a band and is worried about how to propose to his love, Alexa.  Make no bones about it though - they are both top-notch cops and don't miss a thing.Meanwhile, in France, Daniel Darret has a new life as an apprentice furniture maker.  He has taken on a sobriquet and loves the quiet, calming life and work that is now his.  When Lonnie, a man he knew from his past life, appears and then is suddenly dead, Daniel knows there is trouble ahead.  Once an African revolutionary, Daniel has given all this up.  Will he have to go back to this era in time when violence was nothing more to him than a quiet breath?  When the most important aspect of his life were the noises he made in hopes of the changes that would come about?As expected, Vaughn and Benny's investigation crosses paths with Daniel Darrin's situation and the plot becomes complexly wonderful.  As I'd read about one aspect of a huge conspiracy, I'd forget momentarily about the other aspects of this novel, thinking things were going in one direction when they were actually headed somewhere else entirely.This novel is a joy ride and it is going at top speed.  There were times when it was a bit difficult to follow but that is not uncommon in Meyer's writings.  Take my word, it will all make complete sense if you just follow along.  And besides this novel being a thriller, it has great characters that are fleshed out and full of life (or death, if they're in the wrong place at the wrong time).  What I especially like about Deon Meyer is the way that cultural aspects of South Africa are intricately woven into the narrative.  This book has it all and it is not one to miss.",5,0,2244,0.111,0
108,"Overall, I give this book 3 out of 5 stars.  While there were definitely some useful and helpful ideas, there was also some dangerous and flat out terrible advice.  Overall, the podcast appearances promoting the book and the information discussed on those podcasts was much more impactful than the book itself in my opinion.The Good/Helpful:- Some useful websites for side hustles- Unique and powerful ways to change your mindset- Emphasis on the importance of doing as much as possible as soon as possible- Some general guidelines around categorical spendingThe Bad/Dangerous- Limited discussion until the end of the book (p. 290) about Sequence of Return Risk.  This is something few people understand and it is flat out dangerous to lead someone to potentially believe that they can retire decades earlier than ""standard/normal retirement age"" with significantly less money than they would supposedly otherwise need to accumulate by age 65, immediately starting withdrawing from these funds, and that their money will likely double, triple, or quadruple by the time they're much older.  Yes, this is possible IF someone can remain flexible (on taking withdrawals from their assets, on generating income in ""retirement""), IF someone has alternate income sources, IF market conditions are generally favorable during at least the first decade of ""retirement,"" etc., but there is a major risk here as well.  The author does mention these items and does provide a few cautionary words, but I do not think this was stressed enough for the average reader to truly understand the complete impact/considerations.  I feel like most people will think, ""oh, awesome, I can retire in my 30s with $1.25M, starting taking withdrawals right away, never run out of money, and my portfolio will be worth multiples of the $1.25M in my later years.""  More time should be spent discussing sequence of return risk.- Asset Allocation Metrics Are Questionable: p.235 suggests only a 5% international allocation.  For most investors, especially younger ones with likely higher risk tolerances, this is unnecessarily low.- Qualified Dividends Categorization: p. 252 suggests that whether or not dividends are qualified (versus ordinary) is based on the length of time a stock is held.  Not true.- Holding Bonds/Fixed Income in Taxable Accounts: p. 254 says [...] you will keep your tax burden as low as possible at the end of each year, since bonds typically have lower returns than stocks.""  Really?!?  Bonds income is taxed as ordinary income.  Why would you voluntarily hold bonds in a taxable account and pay ordinary income taxes?  Anyone who knows anything about financial planning knows that, generally speaking, it makes sense to hold growth-oriented investments, like stocks, in a taxable brokerage account (due to more favorable taxation) and fixed income investments like bonds in tax-deferred plans (since bonds are taxed at ordinary income and all funds coming out of pre-tax plans are going to be taxed at ordinary income tax rates anyway).  It's not just about returns from the standpoint of capital appreciation, but total returns, which include dividend income, interest income, etc.  While stocks may increase in value faster than/more than stocks over a long period of time, that does NOT mean you should hold bonds in a taxable account!- Bonds vs. Bond Funds: p. 289 says ""One nice feature of bonds is that you know exactly how your bond investments will grow each year, so the income is guaranteed.""  Is it?  No, no it's not at all - especially if you're using bond FUNDS like the author suggests.  If you hold an actual bond to maturity, it works slightly differently.  Either way, that bond income is not ""guaranteed.""I think the author means well and I think his story of going from dead broke to millionaire in 5 years is awesome.  As he mentions, he did that with some sacrifices, including personal relationships.  I wish he would have spend more time digging into this and its importance, as I feel like many people struggle with this.  I think it's a great book for him to tell his story and what worked for him, but I think he should leave the financial advice to those that are much more familiar with how this stuff works.  If you're looking for a similar book, but much better, I would recommend Set for Life by Scott Trench.  For those interested in real estate, the section in this book on real estate is generally weak in my opinion.  I agree with the author's position on putting less than 20% down in certain situations - his examples of why on this are right on.  In general, though, I would suggest checking out BiggerPockets for in-depth real estate investing info.",3,3,4683,0.135,1

111,"What a strong start!  Only to dwindle a bit.  I loved the premise of this book, and indeed had never heard of sin eaters before.  I think the way that Campisi approached the Sin Eater story was innovative and intriguing.  However, the character development and pace of the book wasn't quite what I was hoping for.May is on her own after the death of her parents.  Struggling to survive, she is caught stealing, and her punishment is to become a Sin Eater.  It means no talking, no being talked to, and taking on the sins of others at their deathbed.  Problems arise though when foods that were not sins disclosed appear on a casket, and May is thrust into a world where safety is elusive and justice seemingly fleeting.May as a character is ok.  I feel like her development is very minimal.  She has some insights into her own character, but largely is inconsistent.  The rest of the characters are merely side stories and while we're supposed to probably connect with some of them, that was difficult for me.  I also think not making them mirror quite the regular universe of English monarchy would have helped immerse the reader a bit more.  As it was, too many comparisons and character inspirations could be linked to the Virgin Queen, etc.  For me, it was more like reading a false history instead of a new innovative story as a result.The concepts are where this book really stands out.  I love the idea of how the Sin Eater works in this story.  The descriptions of the food were intriguing, and I wish there had been more of them and their links to the different sins.  I also thought May's struggles were relatable and you could become interested in her story.  At first, the book, was hard to put down.  I managed to read half of it in one sitting and didn't want to stop.  At a point though, the story seemed to lose focus and meander and the conclusion and mystery solving just left me feeling ""meh"" at the end.  I think a lot more could have been done with it.This is an intriguing story, but it kind of fizzled for me.  I could see those interested in alternate universes and Elizabethan lore being interested in it.  But in general, it's solid fiction and good for a quick read.Review by M.

112,"Thank you to Edelweiss for an eARC.  I also purchased the kindle edition from Amazon.Sloan, whom we met in The Friend Zone, is living in the ""in-between.""  She's been in a 2-year state of prolonged grief and stasis since her fiance died.  Kristen and Josh are still very much there for her but she can't break free of her suspended life.  Even the house is unchanged since Brandon died.A chance encounter with a runaway dog breaks Sloan out of her pattern.  Now she has someone to care for and she very responsibly tries to track down his owner.  Said owner won't answer his phone and we are off and running.Sloan and Jason begin their relationship via text and phone calls which feels very modern, but since Sloan is still locked in her old pattern she's very slow to reveal herself (even a photo) to Jason which feels like old fashioned courtship.  Once they finally meet the chemistry between them is explosive and hard for them to handle.  I love what a gentleman Jason is throughout what amounts to a slow burn romance.  Because of Sloan's past, he's willing to move at her pace and he makes it clear from the beginning that she is the ONE for him.Before they can get there, Jason's own life and career begin to interfere with the development of the relationship and they have to think seriously about how to deal with what will be some monumental changes to both their lives and if their relationship can survive it.  This part of the story was very realistic and did not treat either character as stupid or unwilling to communicate.  The obstacles were considerable and the story was not dumbed down to get past them.  In the end, Sloan and Jason need to decide if their love for each other is worth being creative about solutions.The conclusion was A  and genuinely brought me to tears.  Kristen is 100 percent there for Sloan throughout and I appreciate that their friendship was not left on the back burner just because Sloan had a new relationship.One final point--the ""other woman"" is often a lazy way for writers to get an obstacle into a relationship.  She's usually villainous and utterly one-dimensional.  I'm very thankful to see Jimenez resist that here and make all the characters believable and realistic even the challenging ones.5 stars and ready to keep reading this author!",5,0,2297,0.133,0
113,"This is an excellently and beautifully written novel.  It's atmospheric and evocative of the period when it takes place.  The characters have depth and complexity and their lives touched me and educated me.  I was glued to my chair reading this, with feelings of dread, despair, and hope running through me as I worked my way through the 287 pages of thought-provoking story.  Sounds like this is a 5-star book, doesn't it?  It is, except that it let me down at the very end and that brought my rating down to 4.This book was released in the U.K. in February of this year with the title THE FOUNDLING.  I actually prefer that title to the one given this April 2020 U.S. release.  I guess it was thought that we Yanks would not know what a foundling is, so the powers that be who name books were keeping it simple for us?  Whatever the case and whatever its name, this sophomore effort by Stacey Halls (after her debut work THE FAMILIARS) is definitely worth the read.The author brings the Georgian period to life in all its grimy, dirty ugliness for the poor and its sumptuous life for the rich, in the same way that Dickens gave us his complete picture of Victorian times.  Dickens' novels were contemporary fiction when published and he used his own early life and his insightful powers of observation to expose socioeconomic disparities of the 1800s.  Halls exposes these same disparities of the 1700s but obviously writing historical fiction using great research and an excellent imagination.This story is narrated by two women:  (1) Bess Bright, a young, lower-class boiled shrimp vendor living in the slums with her father Abe and useless brother Ned, and (2) Alexandra Callard, a youngish rich widow living a pampered but extremely limited life.I found Bess to be an admirable character, hard-working, full of hope and a great attitude, living a difficult life with honor and responsibility.  In 1747 she gave birth to an illegitimate daughter and, unable to care for her, delivered her that same day to the Foundling Hospital, hoping some day to save up enough money to reclaim her child.  Six years later, in early 1754, Bess goes to do just that, only to find that someone pretending to be her had taken her baby away just one day after Bess had left her at the orphanage.  It becomes Bess's mission in life to track down her daughter and reclaim her.And then there's rich widow Alexandra Callard, living a privileged life in an upscale area of London.  Alexandra is an extremely complicated character who was hard for me to understand and like at first, but, as the story progressed, the mystery of why she was the way she was became more clear.  See, in spite of having everything she could possibly want, money, a beautiful home, a lovely young daughter, servants to take care of everything, she is a bit of a mess.  She's afraid of life.  She's cold and withdrawn emotionally, not even showing affection to her own daughter.  She does not leave the house except for Sunday worship and does not allow her 6-year-old daughter Charlotte to leave either or to have any friends.  She is obsessed with safety and with keeping her home locked up tight.Bess and Alexandra's lives become entwined when Bess is hired as nursemaid to Charlotte, this through the intervention of Dr. Mead, a director at the Foundling Home where Bess had left her baby years ago and, coincidentally, Alexandra's only friend.  It's pretty obvious early on what the true connection these two have but there are a few puzzling how's and why's that will be revealed.  But, more to the point, this is a great story about social injustice, about motherhood, about love and connection.  About what makes for a good mother.  What is more important:  love and affection in a life of dire poverty, or a life of luxury without that affection?The point about motherhood and the bond of mother and child would have been better presented with all things being equal, IMO.  A mother's love (or at least kindness) in both economic situations.  As presented in this story, the result is skewed to a great extent.  One other problem I had with this plot is the ending, which is too pat, too tidy, with a too-abrupt personality change for one of the main characters.Yet the grit, grime, poverty, atmosphere and socioeconomic levels of life in Georgian England are excellently represented here.  In addition, the writing is superior and the characters, main and secondary, developed with real depth.  This came close to being a 5-star book for me.",4,0,4511,0.19,1
114,"So many beautiful, charming, poignant, emotional moments in this love story.  Abby Jimenez writes the perfect “recovery” plotline for the grief Sloan suffered with the abrupt loss of her fiancée two years ago.  This story delivers Sloan from the depth of that depression to her Happy Ever After with Jason – via his dog, Tucker.  Having absolutely ugly-cried my eyes out when Sloan’s fiancée died in The Friend Zone, I wondered just how Jimenez was going to make her whole again.  Well, she did it, and wow!Enter Tucker.  This pup just happens to jump into Sloan’s life thru her car’s sunroof.  As she starts caring for this lost dog – while leaving messages daily for the no-reply/deadbeat owner – she becomes attached.  This begins the reawakening of Sloan.  Taking the dog for walks – getting her exercising and out of the house.  AND her mind distracted from her gut-wrenching grief.Next, we finally hear from Tucker’s owner, Jason.  I loved his character immediately – as he dumps a model/girlfriend for losing his dog while he’s away hiking the wilderness.  Once he finds Tucker with Sloan, they begin a flirty, long-distance, texting courtship.  This is such an ideal way to get Sloan even thinking about entering the dating pool again.  Jason, by the way, is an up and coming Rock Star – looking for a gal who doesn’t want him only for his celebrity.They finally meet – instant attraction.  A whirlwind couple of weeks of romance, check-ins from bestie Kristen (our fabulous fun darling from The Friend Zone) and a quick trip to meet Jason’s parents.  Then they are off onto the adventures of a new relationship.  Our author kicks in some adorable moments, a crazy ex, more ugly-crying -- then gives us the HEA in a spectacular reunion.The Happy Ever After Playlist flawlessly weaves a delicate path from grieving to the forever romance for Sloan and Jason.  When I finished reading this book – I immediately wanted to re-read it all over again just for the feels!  It was a bonus to get in some kid updates with Kristen and Josh as well.  This book will be on my “Best of 2020” list for sure.Also – please don’t forget to read the “Note from the Author” at the end of the book.  Abby adds so much personal background to this story – no wonder it’s so beautiful!",5,0,2270,0.198,1
115,"Five years ago, author David Baldacci introduced us to Amos Decker, the Memory Man.  A devastating hit during his rookie year with the Cleveland Browns left him with synesthesia, the ability to see numbers in colors and more disturbingly, death in a dazzling shade of blue, and hyperthymesia, or the inability to forget any detail from his life; perfect recall.  Baldacci takes us on his sixth adventure with the Memory Man in “Walk the Wire”.The FBI sends Amos Decker and his partner, Alex Jamison, to the booming fracking town of London, North Dakota to investigate a grisly murder.  Their investigation kicks the door open to a slew of deadly secrets the town desperately wants to keep hidden.  Ruthless businessmen, the oil & gas industry, a mysterious military installation, and a secluded religious sect conspire amongst themselves to keep their affairs shielded from outside eyes.  As the body count grows and the clues point in every possible direction, Decker and Jamison must rely on an unexpected ally if they expect to deliver justice for the victims.  Baldacci takes us on a wild ride where nothing is as it appears, and nobody is above suspicion with “Walk the Wire”.Baldacci has once again crafted a wonderful mystery-thriller, rife with red herrings, twists, and reversals.  Fans of the “Memory Man” series will be right at home with Decker and Jamison as the classic no-nonsense detectives they have come to know over the first five entries.  Decker’s deductive power is as sharp as ever as he traverses the vagaries of this thriving fracking town.The characterization of Amos Decker and Alex Jamison is literary gold, as they’ve quickly become two of Baldacci’s greatest creations.  While the character of Alex Jamison is a dynamic multi-dimensional character with a terrific backstory, Decker’s sidekick takes a step back for this entry, as a great deal of time is spend exploring Decker’s internal struggle to reconcile his tragic past with what he still has, specifically a loving, though estranged, family and friends that would do anything for him.  The theme of family, and the nature of family, is repeated throughout the novel, as Decker realizes he must choose to reconnect with his family in the same way he must choose to embrace his FBI family.  The aloof, social misfit introduced to audiences in “Memory Man” is fighting desperately to turn a corner.  He shows empathy towards strangers and compassion where he never has before.  Jamison, herself, is taken aback several times as Decker grows as a character, and as readers we bear witness to the gradual evolution of this terrific character.  Baldacci populates his narrative with a cast of supporting characters that are perfect compliments to Decker and Jamison.  Both sympathetic and deceitful, Baldacci creates a world where no one is what they seem to be, and suspicion is cast on them all.Baldacci utilizes his signature short chapters and break-neck pacing to craft a compelling page-turner.  He grabs the reader from the first chapter and doesn’t let up until the answers are finally revealed.  The story is told from the 3rd person point of view from several different perspectives, and works perfectly to provide distance and maintain a mysterious tone throughout.  The reader is forced to reason through each clue rather than instantly knowing Decker’s thoughts and impressions.While I found the characterization, narrative flow, and pacing to be shining examples of Baldacci at the top of his game, I found the plot somewhat troublesome and for once an example of Baldacci trying to outdo himself.  The setup was perfect; a murder in a booming fracking town, but I feel the execution slightly missed the mark.  In my opinion, the plot was overly ambitious in that there was so much involved.  I counted no less than three distinct plotlines that could have each been made into there own novels.  Attempting to use all three of them together in a cohesive way that made sense was difficult as it simply weighed down the plot with needlessly complicated subplots. I was slightly taken out of the story as I questioned the plausibility of so much deviousness going on in this one small town.“Walk the Wire” is the triumphant return of classic Baldacci characters.  Amos Decker and Alex Jamison once again prove that David Baldacci is a master of mystery thrillers, and he remains at the top of his game.  Fan of the series will love revisiting these characters, and newcomers will be hooked by this action-packed page-turner.  Plan on spending some time, because this one is hard to put down.",4,0,4584,0.089,0
116,"The author spends a lot of time repeating the same information over and over about a particular book he read that influenced his scripting method.  Also repeating the same story about landing a re-occurring role on a TV show.  The examples he provides largely take place between 2003 and 2009.  The author lost credibility for me when he calls this method of scripting ones life as magic, but stating it is not the same kind of magic as witchcraft magic.  This is absolutely witchcraft magic and if he has read anything on the subject of witchcraft magic he would have understood this.  Additionally, scripting as he describes it is the same thing as a Wiccan Book of Shadows or a Rune casting journal.  He claims discovery on the journaling method as being the key to making scripting your life work, along with having“intention” and allowing oneself to experience strong emotions about expected future events as part of the manifestation process.  Again this is knowledge that has been around for a very long time.  He also attempts to provide empirical research in the area of quantum physics based on his personal studies, without having any credentials.  After reading his comment about magic and witchcraft I certainly would not place any credence to the empirical research in science, aside from the information I already know to be true.  This book would have been an interesting and inspiring self help piece if the author had edited some of the repetitive information, done some additional reading about magic and left the detailed science related info out of the book.  This book was not worth the $12 for the Kindle edition, and I considered asking for my money back.  I am sorry to provide you with this review, Royce but there are some areas for improvement here.  I applaud you for writing a book about something like this, but it felt was more of a biography with a few lessons learned from  self help materials written by others, and I think you would enjoy reading more about  magic in general.  A good book for you that adds science and magic, plus the notion of focused “intention” and writing things down  is something called Real Magic by Dean Radin.

117,"Earth, Our Original Monastery is an answer to our prayer of overwhelm as to where to start with our restoration and reparation of our relationship to Earth.  Challenged by the evidence of the scientists and the haunted cries of the children, we find ourselves wringing our hands not knowing what to do about the immensity of the threat to our homeplace of precious origin, the literal ground of our being, the very breath of our continued living.  In this gift of a book, Christine Valters Painter offers us a through-line.  ‘We will save only that what we love’ and there she begins with love, gratitude and wonder, with relationship rather than sermonising on our all wrongdoing.  We think of monasteries as peaceful, prayerful habitats where the design of every space and the pattern of every moment intend to lift the mind and heart of every monk to the presence and love of God.  So it is with Earth, Our original monastery, Christine as wise guide, as initiated indigenous, leads us out into Earth’s habitats and ways that we might discover afresh our intimacy as creature among creatures, not as creature apart, severed from our origins.  In the motif of practice, rhythm and discipline we are invited to discover wildness, abandon, abundance and our innate creativity.  The text is teeming with beauty and insight and offerings from hosts of other revered elders, monks and saints.  The first Chapter alone is worthy of meditative re-reading for many a long day.  Step by step, chapter by chapter we are seduced back into our bodies and out onto Earth and all her mysterious beauty.  The structure of the book, a repeating of process with its shifting themes and emphases assists us to cultivate again a habit of reverence for all that Earth already is and all that is yet to be discovered.  The transfusion of the great arteries of religious tradition -Cathedrals/Scriptures/Sacraments/Icons/Liturgy/Saints  as the original blood flow of creation is revelatory and pulsing with life.  Perhaps most fundamentally, the journey Christine Valters Paintner takes us on in Earth, Our Original Monastery makes it more impossible to continue any habit of convenience or other aspects of our cherished lifestyle which desecrate any part of that vast tapestry of life, beauty and revelation, in which we are wholly threaded.",5,0,2323,0.163,0
118,"I received a free copy of Deep in the Alaskan Woods in exchange for an honest review.  I was quickly immersed in this story when Alexander's fiance showed his true colors and frightened Alexander so badly she packed her stuff, sold her car, and made a road trip from Illinois to Alaska to meet with her twin cousins.I really liked the Alaska nexus and the beginning plot.  What I didn't care for is how quickly Alexander and Quinn became acquainted and ""fell in love.""  This all happened within a week or two of Alexander arriving in Alaska.  There was no time for Alexander to process her breakup, or time to build trust, get to know one another, and develop a relationship with Quinn.Alexander was not a character that I thought highly of.  She was constantly sharing other people's private events with others.  For example, Quinn told her that his father and dog died when he was younger from a bear attack, and  he had a hard time dealing with that event.  Alexander ran back to her cousins and told them all about Quinn's guilt and  feelings.  That was not her place to share.  Alexander did this throughout the book with other characters.  This was a huge turn off.I also thought Alexander was a little too emotional about her twin that died in the womb.  Alexander learned later in life she had a twin, and apparently had survivor guilt and had to seek counseling.  Alexander kept bringing this topic up to her cousins, Quinn, and anyone else that would listen throughout the book, and frequently cried because of it.  This was more of a distraction then an asset for the plot.The strangest part was halfway through the book the theme switched from abuse, to developing a relationship with Quinn, to Alexander's cousin's son dealing with his father's death from a plane crash, to a supplemental character Mary loosing her relatives in a flood nearby, to a murder of Quinn's co-worker's girlfriend, to Alexander's abduction.  Just way to much switch and bait in this book with no clear focus.  I was exhausted by the time I finished this book,I also felt like the author failed to bring closure to several of the supplemental characters including Mary and Josh.I finished the book, but overall, it was not a good fit for me.",2,0,2230,0.059,1
119,"Thank you to edelweiss for the eARC in exchange for an honest review.Wow.  This book was a revelation and all it took was a gender swap around the character of the Rake.  I mention the ""character"" of the rake, because, of course, the seducer of women and the man who refuses to let anyone fill the emotional holes in his soul until he meets the heroine, has been around in literature and theater for a long time.  He usually meets a tragic end until modern historical romance resurrected him as something of the standard male lead/hero.I had not read Peckham before, but I appreciated her introduction where she dedicates the book to Mary Wollstonecraft and explains why she chose to flip the script in historical romance.  This allows the reader to come into the story with an understanding of why the progress of the typical romantic storyline is going to look quite a bit different.And boy does it.  Sera is a mess.  Her hurts and past come spilling out as she attempts to write a memoir that will earn her enough coin to help other 'fallen' women like herself.  She's an alcoholic who is drinking her pain.  She's blunt about sex and often rude and dismissive to Adam who finds her fascinating and desirable anyway.  I loved Peckham for letting Sera be a mess and having her actions reap realistic consequences.  Sera and Adam's relationship is very rocky but also very passionate and the way that they both navigate their challenges (including a very frank and accurate discussion of birth control/pregnancy/childbirth) was realistic and emotionally wrenching.The society of 'fallen' women was also a highlight of the book.  To see these women grapple with the legal restrictions they lived under, the lack of money of their own, the biology they couldn't escape, and still have them support and love one another was one of the things that made this book very special.Two other noteworthy items about The Rakess.  The Cornwall locations are not often seen in historical romance although I remember Cornwall being a favorite for gothics at one point.  The Cornish scenery, food, and customs added a lot to the story.  And the second thing is THAT cover.  Beautiful and I hope someone has a framed copy of the painting.",5,0,2222,0.19,1
120,"""Lincoln on the Verge"" is an impressively researched book.  However this book is very dense and may not be the best book to jump into the Lincoln subject.  I love reading everything I can on Lincoln and he is my favorite president by far.  But it even took my a long time to read this book but I did, cover to cover.  The book tells of his railroad trip from Springfield to DC for his inauguration.  Being a Lincoln enthusiast I knew that this this journey had been rife with dangers due to the succession of many states going on and Lincoln was known as wanting to do anything possible to keep those states united.  There were multiple plots to kill him along his journey to make sure that he never makes it all the way to inauguration day.  I also knew that the Pinkerton Detective Agency (another great historical subject on its own merit!) was involved in helping Lincoln to arrive safely.  This book filled in all those details about this trip that I hadn't yet known.  Lincoln couldn't hide away or appear to be running from his stops and the huge audience of people at each stop awaiting him.  He'd look weak and fearful.  But those stops were truly frightening many times because he was so exposed.  I loved learning about his receptions at each stop and all the unique and sometimes scary encounters.  I liked hearing some stories of his son Robert's time on the trip along with how his younger sons Willie and Tad were already being little scamps getting in practice for their later White House antics.  I took particular interest in the stories from Indianapolis because that is where I live.  I am giving this five stars because the book positively deserves them however I do want to make a point that for me the story was bogged down by vast descriptions of each state and its industries.  I didn't mind so much the pieces that fed into the political climate however often I felt like there were pages and pages of details about cities and towns that simple weren't interesting. or directly relating to the topic of Lincoln.  It was worth those though for all the little gems of information sprinkled within the book that I had not known about previously.",5,0,2168,0.153,0
121,"I have read all of Anne Tyler’s novels.  I didn’t set out to do that, but I learned quickly that I would fall in love with her rich characters.  I was surprised to see that she had a new book published in April and am so thankful to NetGalley and Knopf for letting me read it past the pub date.My book club met by Zoom this week and they were excited when I told them about this new book.  One of our group said that she had re-read all of her books last summer.  I was reminded of Accidental Tourist when I finished this book.  They’re not all quippy and light.  Amateur Marriage was bruising.  I feel the need to make it clear that I am a fan and probably not an objective reviewer.I loved this book and I wanted to bonk Micah on the top of his knucklehead.  He had created the shell of a life, protected by undeviating routine and paid for by self employment.  Every morning his routine was, well, routine.  “He had a system: he set the dishes to work while he wiped the tale and countertop, put away the butter, ran his stick vacuum under his chair in case he’d dropped any crumbs.  His actual vacuuming day was Friday, but he liked to keep on top of things between times.”  He created several foreign accents and talked to himself in one or the other while he worked.“One of the unique things about Tyler’s characters is that some of them don’t develop.  We learn about character development in our writing classes, but in the real world, some people just don’t learn and grow.  Especially in her earlier books, I’d want to shake the protagonist and say, wake up!  This is your life and you need to live it!!  So here I was, all attached to Micah, hoping he wouldn’t be one of them.  Maybe he is, maybe he isn’t.  I’m not going to spoil it for you.I adore the “why” behind the book title.  I ran before work for years until I retired, my partner Pam and me.  We both ran without our glasses because our eyes would run and tears pool.  We saw the most amazing apparitions along our course.  And yeah, I’m sure there was a redhead or two along the way.",5,0,2055,0.179,0
122,"What a story this is.  The story of a woman who might have been Jesus’ wife, spanning the time shortly before he begins his mission to his death.  A surprising story.  Not a story about the type of woman we might expect to be Jesus’ wife, not his Little Helper, quiet, devout, always by his side, deferring to him, acquiescing to his every wish.  Instead it’s the story of a strong woman with a voice that will not be silenced who makes her own path, finds her destiny and satisfies her longings.  It’s a story about her everyday relationship with him and her influence on him, and His influence on her and His understanding of the unique person she was.Ana is very much her own person and always has been.  Her background and personality are nothing like that of Jesus.  She comes from wealth and privilege, isn’t always a nice person, is often selfish and self-centered.  In other words, often human  She isn’t necessarily a believer either, but her love for Jesus is deep.  It came over her the first time she saw him and never wavers.We don’t know that Jesus had a wife, but we don’t know that he didn’t either, since the Bible doesn’t tell us much about those years.  Author Sue Monk Kidd flawlessly weaves the “what if’s” with what we already know of Jesus’ life and presents a story that is completely plausible and believable, and completely mesmerizing, filled with characters that could have been part of history.  Her parents, her aunt Yaltha, her friend Tabitha, and her brother Judas – that Judas – all come alive.  As does the human Jesus, leading an everyday life as a husband, brother and son, while being drawn to a higher purpose.Women were meant to be silent and obedient in this time and place.  Wealth, privilege, or association with a powerful ruler did not exempt you from danger.  Again, author Kidd weaves in facts about known historical figures with events and consequences in the lives of Ana and her friends and relatives.The Book of Longings is extraordinary, touching, thought-provoking and a very enjoyable read.  I received an advance copy from publisher Random House.  All opinions are my own.  I thoroughly enjoyed this book and recommend it without hesitation.",5,0,2195,0.151,1
123,"Review of:  The King's Beast: A Mystery of the American Revolution (Bone Rattler)Fortunately, the King’s Beast is the right ‘size’.  What do I mean by that?  Well, you know how some books are 200 pages long and you kind of say, “Where’s the rest of it?” … other books are 600 pages long and there is so much ‘fluff’ added to the story that you know that the book could have easily been 400 pages and still said everything that needed to be said.The King’s Beast is roughly 400 pages of small print … and that, somehow, feels just about right.  The story isn’t rushed while, at the same time, it does not seem to be fluffed-up in an extreme attempt to just fill up pages with words.  One caution though, the print is small and you, like me, may need to dig into around and find your reading glasses to make the reading a little more comfortable; but it will be worth the effort.The story (and no, I’m not going to go into deep-dive detail, you can read the product page and other reviews for that) is really interesting.  For that matter, I’d go so far to say that it is fairly unique.  I can’t, at least off the top-of-my-head think of another series of books that use the history of the American Revolution interwoven with a “mystery” of why some old bones are so important.  If you are looking for a ‘cozy mystery’, where some detective shows up trying to solve a murder that could have been committed by anyone of seven people stuck in a house, then there are lots of good options out there but “The King’s Beast” certainly doesn’t fall into that formulaic category.Granted, as you would expect from any novel, some liberties are taken with historical facts and historical figures but the book does a decent job of keeping the situations at least somewhat believable (within in the context of a fictional book, of course).Overall, Eliot Pattison has done a remarkable job in taking what had to be a difficult concept to work with and making a novel that is a very interesting read.If you are looking for a novel that is ‘different’, with a unique take on combining history and ‘mystery’ then this novel should be on you shopping list.",4,0,2137,0.132,0
124,"I really enjoyed the first chapter of this book.  It started off very interesting with some good facts.  Then it went on to Trojan horses and really used the story to illustrate the idea of trojan horse in computer security well.  Of course that's been done to death, but it was good and the graphics added a lot to it.Where it got weird for me was when it went all out on what seemed to me an anti-Christian smear.  It started quoting scripture left and right and kept asserting that the BIBLE had primed American society to accept mass surveillance because of the concept of an all seeing God.  OK - I'm pagan, and let me say right now that even Zeus could turn into a bird and watch over people directly on earth, even come down and get some poor woman pregnant.  Some religions have the concept of an angel assigned to watch you from birth - the 'all seeing eye' is not exclusive to the Bible and that chapter just didn't seem fair at all to me.  As I was reading it, I kept thinking ""Well someone certainly has a grudge against Christians.""  Well, that was my take, as a pagan.  It was WIERD.  That whole section was weird.  It kinda got a bit weird when it talked about slavery too.  According to the book, the civil war was solely fought to end slavery, and it's easy to get the impression from the book that every white person in the South was absolutely brutal to the black population.  I appreciated how surveillance impacted the poor slaves' ability to escape their bondage and situation, but just again, it got a bit weird.The book never really returned from that quick and hard listing of events that directly related to current events.  Most was just history and how spying and surveillance had impacted the ability of people to further justice, equality and opportunity for all.It's in comic book form, but it's not a fun read.  At times I felt like I was trapped inside the mind of a radical thinker while reading this.I'm really vacillating between two and three stars, but I'll give it a 3 because it is interesting to read an argument against surveillance using older history as examples of how it hurts people and hinders progress.",3,1,2151,0.148,1
125,"My Kind of Cowboy was a good book that I read all in one day.  I thought it was well-written, had enjoyable characters, had a good story and was set in picturesque Wyoming.  I felt like I was living on the ranch alongside the Merrick family.Brand Merrick was the oldest great-grandson who worked the family ranch.  After a fall off a horse, he cut short his recovery time simply because he felt he was needed back at work.  Soon his grandmother began to notice he had a limp and appeared to be in pain (although he wouldn't ever admit to it).  She secretly hired a physical therapist (Avery) to come live with them for 6 weeks to aid in his recovery.  Brand was NOT happy to hear about the physical therapy plan and he was already dreaming up ways he could get out of it.  Everyone assumed Avery was a man so imagine their surprise when a very female Avery showed up for six weeks of therapy.Avery was from Michigan and needed a break from her life - her mother had died when she was young leaving Avery's father as her only family member, her father became very detached and married to his job virtually ignoring Avery and she was being threatened by an anonymous stalker.  She figured a temporary move to Wyoming was just what she needed to feel alive (and safe) again.  But Avery didn't expect to fall in love with Wyoming itself - and the people.  She began to feel at home and didn't miss the rush hour traffic or the hustle and bustle of the big city.  But soon her stalker found her in Wyoming and began to make threatening text messages again - at about the same time that Brand started to see the benefits of his physical therapy with her (as did a few others in his family).  Now that Avery had become someone special to all of Brand's family, they would not let her be harmed by some crazed lunatic.  Or was this crazy person too much for the Merrick's to handle?This is book 1 in a new series.  I will definitely be reading book 2 when it is released.I was provided an ARC of this book in exchange for an honest review.  The opinion stated above is mine without any biases.",4,0,2085,0.086,0
126,"There is nothing like opening up a book that is a part of a series and instantly getting lost in the story.  As soon as you start reading you are back in the town with the people and it is like you never left.....that is the feeling you get as soon as you start reading Pulp Friction, the second book in Julie Anne Lindsey's Cider Shop Mystery series.  Once you read the first book, Apple Cider Slaying, you know that you will return to this series whenever a new book comes out.Once you start reading Pulp Friction you are back at Smythe Orchards in Blossom Valley, Virginia  hanging out with Granny Smythe and her granddaughter Winnie Mae.  And all you want to do is hang around the orchard and cider shop with Winnie.  And in the beginning of Pulp Friction they are hosting a wedding in the big historical barn which they had redone for things like this.  It's a young couple who were in the middle of planning a big city wedding where they live but the bride changed things in the middle and wanted it to be a small country wedding and Smythe Orchards would be perfect.Unfortunately they did not know that during the reception when all the guests and most of the town were partying in the barn, the groom would get run over by the car the bride and groom were suppose to ride away with to start their new life together.  And to make things worse, Winnie saw her ex-boyfriend Hank arguing with the groom and peeling out of the parking lot right before the groom was found dead.Even though Hank is her ex-boyfriend and the Sheriff keeps telling Winnie to stay out of it, she cannot help but do her own innocent investigating.  She can't help it really, her brain just won't shut down.....Julie Anne Lindsey captures the readers attention immediately and you cannot help but get lost in the story.  You will see everything so clearly in your mind and wish you could be there with Winne, except for the scary parts, those you will be thankful you are on your couch reading it and it isn't real.  So I highly recommend grabbing your copy of Pulp Friction and it wouldn't be a bad idea to grab the first book, Apple Cider Slaying, while your at it.",5,0,2146,0.071,0
127,"I was ready for some romance on our anniversary, so I started this book.  As I read, it felt like I had fallen into a fairy tale, the one about Cinderella.  Mitchell Fisher, the protagonist, has given up his dream of being an engineer and is working a job that requires that he cut the padlocks off of the “love bridge” in his little village.  One day, in the normal course of his work, he sees a young woman fall off the bridge.  Mitchell doesn’t hesitate to jump into the strong current to save her.  As the hero, he obviously wants to know the name of the young woman whose life he saved, but she disappears before he even finds her name.  Then, in a real coincidence that is necessary to make the story work, Mitchell goes to get his daughter Poppy from her music lesson.  There he meets Liza, who happens to be the sister of the young woman whom he rescued and who tells him that her name is Yvette and that she has been missing for several years now.  Strange circumstances, but it actually makes the story!  Mitchell becomes a hero to the town and receives letters about his heroism.  (The part about the letters presents an entire sub-plot).  I enjoyed the story but was not ready for the Cinderella feel of it.  I really liked the characters but I did not think that they were as well developed as they could have been.  The mystery of why Yvette disappeared and where she is now was well written, kind of like a little suspense built into the romance storyline.  My favorite character was Poppy, who represented the hopeful belief in good things that young children have.  I also liked the friendship that developed between Mitchell and Liza, both of whom complemented each other well.  All in all, it was a good romantic read and perfect for these uncertain times.DisclaimerDisclosure of Material Connection:I received a complimentary copy of this book from the publisher via Netgalley.

128,"I bought this book on the recommendation of my best friend.  I am so grateful to have done so.  It is a profound little book that is packed with glorious truths about the heart of Christ toward all who are His.  It is a rare teaching, to say the least, as so many times these days there is much teaching that leans toward legalism and chastisement and warning; and rules;  and on the other side of the aisle, there is a lot of teaching that is totally not Biblical (i.e. much of the Charismatic teachings that make God our Santa Clause).  For one who grew up in a very abusive environment, and never feeling I will ever be good enough in many circles, the truths in this book have touched me more deeply than any other book I have ever read in my life, other than the Bible, itself.  Dane Ortlund has a true gift of being able to make his point in ways that deeply touch the heart.  This is a book I will read over and over.  I have read it very slowly to be able to think about and absorb the truths more deeply.  I pray that everyone who does not know the Jesus that Dane Ortlund speaks of in this book is able to get a copy of it and that it is as healing for them as it has been for me.  It is one I want to stay on for some time.  It is literally life-changing.  I have come to a place of understanding there is absolutely nothing I can do about my sin, as I am born a sinful creature, and that will never change this side of eternity.  That is not to say that God is not doing a major work of sanctification in my life that will continue till I see Him face to face.  But it means that He has such incredible sympathy for us in our fallen condition.  It is the most humbling book I have ever read.  It has done far more in moving me to pursue holiness than all the teachings and warnings I have heard from the pulpit all the years of my Christian walk.  It causes me to want more and more of Jesus and our Father, rather than driving a wedge of condemnation between me and Him.",5,1,1983,0.08,1

130,"I knew going into this book that it would be an emotional read.  It's written in first person, alternating between the 2 main characters: May and Zach.  It takes place about 11 months after a school shooting where May hid in a closet while her twin brother, classmates and teacher were killer by the shooter.  May has understandably not been the same since, only confiding in one friend.  She is dealing with an incredible amount of anger, guilt, isolation and panic attacks - she is very much not okay.  She can be a little hard to relate to at times, but she's also very human.  Zach has also been struggling ever since his mother, a lawyer, took on the case defending the shooter.  He was already dealing with a workaholic mother and depressed father, and now most of his classmates have made him an outcast.When the story began, I wondered how these two characters would possibly connect, as it seemed like such an unlikely pairing.  Somehow it works though, and they bring out the best in each other.  The romance that begins helps lighten the mood of the traumatic issues the book is covering.A lot of issues are covered in this book beyond the obvious, and nearly every character is dealing with something - the classmates, the siblings, the parents - each has flaws and their own story.  It makes the story complex but the characters are also real.I started this book last night, and got sucked into right from the beginning.  I kept telling myself ""just one more chapter"" yet that never seemed like enough.  By the time I went to bed, I was most of the way through the book already.  I know a book is good when it draws me in that much.This book has a lot of ups and downs, but by the end we see growth in a lot of the characters, which is something I think is important.  I would have liked to see a little more of what happened with May and Zach before the book ended, but it at least leaves you with a sense of hope.Overall I enjoyed reading this book.  It explores a very sensitive topic that too many people have experienced first hand, while still lightening the mood with the start of a new relationship.",4,0,2120,0.111,1
131,"The author, Robert Skidelsky, is Emeritus Professor of Political Economy at the University of Warwick in England.  He wrote a prize-winning three-part biography of John Maynard Keynes.In the Preface, he explains that his reasons for writing this book are to explore the ""methods it [Economics] uses to reach its conclusions.""  These methods exclude many of the motives for our individual action, such as our cultural and institutional (structural) context, including the influence of power: whether Marxist, liberal, or Machiavellian.  In this he attacks the neoclassical school, which claims that only individuals exist.The book is well organized, beginning with chapters on wants and means, growth, equilibrium, and extending to the differences between, and potential marriage of, economics and sociology.Ultimately, the author  questions whether or not economics is a science.  It isn't.  Although those who practice it would disagree, as they, at times hurriedly, rush to an axiomatic approach, fraught with mathematical equations.  In a chapter named ""Sociology and Economics,"" he gets to the heart of the matter.""Humans are born into, nurtured within, and protected by groups.""  He goes on to write that an army regiment, a firm, a trade union are not just a group of contracting people, but each represents an independent agency.In his travels through economic history, he touches upon Marx, Weber, Kant, de Tocqueville, among others, and, especially, Lionel Robbins, a contemporary theorist, who wrote that economics is ""the science which studies human behavior as a relationship between ends and scarce means which have alternative uses"" (Robbins, 1932).""  At the London School of Economics, where he ruled, Robbins championed both individualism and science, two key concepts that Skidelsky abjures.Near the end of the book, the author suggests that academic economics professors tend not to teach historical economics; rather, they favor current theories, as they imbed the successes and failures of the past.  (Of course there are curricula that teach the History of Economics.)  In philosophy departments, it would be hard to imagine that the pre-Socratics and Plato are not taught as precursor to all material that follows.In summary, Skidelsky makes excellent points, even that Economics is not deserving a Nobel Prize, along with the natural sciences.",5,0,2366,0.074,1
132,"This book is outstanding.  The story, about a family with 12 children, 6 of whom are schizophrenic, is fascinating.  It is written in a matter-of-fact, non-judgmental way, leaving it up to the reader to form their own opinions of each parent and sibling.  Should this woman have had 12 children?  Unlike many (potentially) genetic illnesses, schizophrenia doesn't show up until adolescence or sometime after.  With this family, it didn't show up until the boys were in their 20's.  So, Mimi had no idea that she was spawning mentally ill sons.  On the other hand, she became very involved in activities that would take her attention from this growing brood.  Her husband was worse, as he was away from home most of the time.  This caused her to become quite the martinet and, worse, to hand over some of their care to a trusted priest friend, who would take them on camping trips.  Need I say more??Each of the twelve children's lives is carefully discussed.  The first ten children are boys, the final two are girls.  The two girls have very different personalities and deal with their eventual abuse in different ways.  Each of the boys manifests their illness in different ways also, though the tendency is toward violence.With such a huge number of siblings suffering from a little-understood illness, it's almost inevitable that they would be interesting to researchers.  The family story is interspersed with chapters about research into schizophrenia, by several different scientists. .  I found these parts fascinating.  The debate of nature vs. nurture isn't 100% solved, but is discussed so thoroughly that those with Freudian leanings as a cause of this horribly serious illness should start learning the new findings.  A friend whose son is afflicted had to stop reading when she discovered that the drugs he takes can possibly lead to his early death.  And there's no alternative, as research into better drugs is deemed too unprofitable, so big Pharma won't invest the money.  The statistics are frightening, as so many of our homeless and criminals are schizophrenics, and very little is being done to help them.  My friend is terrified of what will happen when she dies and her son is left on his own.  She very well should be.",5,0,2243,0.106,0
133,"Things are never as they seem.  This could not be more true than in this new release.  A man is missing, but is he dead or did he run off with someone else?You know in horror movies when you shout at the screen ""don't go in there"" or ""get out of there now""?  Well, there were several places in this book (especially near the end) where this is what I wanted to shout at Nina.  Especially when everything was coming to a head in the last 15% of the book and my heart was racing fearing for the characters.This book is told from several POV but primarily Nina, the mom, and Maggie, her daughter.  Maggie believes her dad is still alive even though it has been 18 months and his body was never found and there has been no word from him.  Nina, despite everything, has moved on with her life and has found love with someone new, Simon.  Simon Fitch seems to care for Nina and her children, but does he really or is there something more in his motive?The story has some massive twists and turns that I did not expect.  Sure some of it might have been a little predictable, but those twists had me questioning everything I thought I knew about this book and the characters.  Simon is not someone to be trusted, but for the first half of the book or so, I thought he was doing everything for Nina and her family because he loved her.  But he had deeper motives than we could have ever expected.  I would have liked to have seen more into Simon's past than the few glimpses we had because I think it would have explained more about him.While I liked Nina and thought she was doing what she could for her children, I wondered why she waited nearly 2 years before finding a job to support them especially when she discovered that there was no money and Glen had spent it all.  It isn't like the children were young, but maybe it was the grief and everything she went through while searching for Glen and trying to move forward with her life.  I am glad that she started questioning things and didn't take everything at face value.Overall we really enjoyed this book and give it 5 paws up.",5,0,2078,0.106,0
134,"Sin Eaters have actually existed in history.  The dying would confess their sins and, upon their death, the designated sin eater would consume a ritual meal to take on these sins, allowing a sin-free passage to the hereafter for the deceased.  I suppose that for Christians Jesus Christ is their Sin Eater, but the sin eaters referred to in this book by Campisi appear to be secular, not affiliated to any religion.Campisi has taken literary license with the concept of sin eaters and has also placed her sin-eating protagonist into an alternate 16th-century England, with a reigning Virgin Queen Bethany, daughter of the 6-times-married late King Harold II, who had had an antagonistic relationship with her late half-sister Queen Maris. There is a religious war between Eucharistians and the new religion, and, of course, lots of palace intrigue and a particularly creepy, womanizing alternate Robert Dudley (called ""Black Fingers"" here by our protagonist).I suppose that Campisi has made the historical setting an alternate Elizabethan England so that she can be more creative and imaginative without having to fend off accusations of inaccurate, anachronistic storytelling.  But her attention to the details of 16th-century life let the reader know she has done her research.As an example of her imaginative accounting, she has made very free with the details of sin eating.  In history, a piece of bread was placed on the chest of the deceased or on top of the coffin to absorb all sins, and the sin eater would then eat that bread, usually with a glass of ale.  But in this retelling the sin eating is much more complicated.  There is ""A Compendium of Diverse Sins Both Large and Small and Their According Foods"" serving as guideline for the sin eater.  For example, dried raisins must be eaten to absolve adultery, grapes for having a baby out of wedlock, dried plums for incest, etc.  As a matter of fact, 39 sins are listed in this compendium.So, as you can see, in this alternate Elizabethan world, it was important to make sure you gathered together the appropriate foods to match the sins which the dying person had recited to the sin eater.At the beginning of this story, 14-year-old May Owens, in dire straits after being left a penniless orphan, is caught stealing and sentenced to life as a sin eater.  This is perhaps not as harsh as the punishment of death usually meted out to thieves, but sin eaters were shunned by others and considered unclean outcasts.  After all, they consumed and thus would bear all the sins recited to them by the dying.  Not allowed to speak or be spoken to, they were necessary to society but not valued as human beings.Quite a harsh punishment for a young girl who just stole so she would not starve to death.  But May is an admirable heroine.  She has determination and grit and she's a survivor.  The story is atmospheric and gloomy and gritty, but it is also one of hope and of overcoming obstacles.And May is going to need those qualities.  She and her mentor and senior sin eater are summoned to the deathbed of a resident of the queen's palace for the recitation of sins, but when this person dies and they are called again for the ritual sin eating, there is an extra food representing a sin not recited by the deceased:  a deer's heart, which stands for murder of a child.  And there will be another palace death with another ""unrecited"" deer's heart later on in the story.What is happening here?  May feels the need to get to the bottom of this, especially after the fate of her mentor, who refused to eat the deer's heart representing a sin that was not recited to her.  Were these people unrepentant child killers or are they being falsely accused posthumously?  Also, were their deaths natural?  And what baby had been killed if the accusation was true?So the reader follows May around in her new life as a sin eater, watching her try to adapt to being a shunned, disgraced human being and  try to solve a mystery at the same time.  The secondary characters here are varied and vivid and interesting, from all walks of life and all socioeconomic levels.  Some, such as a leper with whom she develops a friendship, are outcasts like her.  It's a stark, rather gloomy story, but it's touching and hopeful at the same time and the ending will not disappoint.",4,2,4314,0.08,1

136,"Ted Templeman’s memoir is one of the best music industry books I have ever read.  Filled with luscious, interesting details about the real business of recording music during the height of the music industry, late 1960’s, 1970’s, and 1980’s.  Templeman produced some of the most memorable, biggest hit records, singles and albums, during that period, and was an integral part of building super groups Van Halen and Doobie Bros (he did all of the Doobies' major hits).Templeman took extensive notes on everything he did.  The actual author, Greg Renoff, spent hours discussing everything with him, and then produced a great book, well written, moving along at a good pace with a real feel for the times and the recording environment.  He’s an excellent writer and this book shows it.A few of the more interesting moments the book reveals.  As a young dude trying to break into producing, after his successful career as the drummer and vocalist for Harper’s Bizarre, Templeman was actually in the studio when Sinatra cut one of his hits, and another session with Elvis.  His first job at WB was tape listener, demos sent in to get record deals.  He pulled the Doobie Bros demo tape out of one batch, got them signed and then became their producer.  He produced all of their monster hits.  His first real producer gig was with Van Morrison.  He produced Nicollette Larson’s huge hit, which made her a star right out of the box.  He signed Van Halen off the street, and produced their first four albums, building them into a monster group, but also dealing with some pretty weird situations with those guys.  His work with Little Feat is so inside, and as well, with Eric Clapton.He gives us a lot about how Warner Bros Records functioned when it was the top label for true artists, the politics, the corporate machinations, the personalities, etc.  He takes us inside many of the best and not so good studios in which he worked.  He gets into a lot of the psychology of how to be a successful music producer.  He did some film scores, but did not like that work.

138,"Thank you to @minotaur_books {#partner} for gifting me with an advanced readers copy of Little Secrets by Jennifer Hillier in exchange for an independent and honest review!Review of Little Secrets by Jennifer Hillier:⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️.Marin is out holiday shopping with her son, Sebastian.  She let’s go of his hand for a few minutes to use her phone and when she looks back, her son is gone.  In broad daylight.  Taken.  A year later and the search for her son has gone nowhere.  She hires a private investigator to help but rather than finding Sebastian, she discovers Marin’s husband, Derek, is having an affair with a much younger woman.  A woman who has orchestrated her way into the Machado’s lives.  Marin has already lost her son and she will not lose her husband too.  Love and rock bottom will make you do some pretty unexpected things.  But what lengths will Marin go to secure the only family she has left?  And who took Sebastian and why?.I stayed up until just before midnight just to finish this book.  I’m looking back at my 12-pages of notes (yes, 12) to see all my questions and assumptions of where I thought the book was headed and while most of my assumptions were right, I was still just as shocked at the ending.  I was so focused on the story lines and all the secrets (God, there are so many secrets!) that I missed what was right in front of me the entire time.  It all came together seamlessly in the end and you start to wonder how you actually missed it all.  I had a lot of OMG and eye-popping moments, as well as moments where I completely misjudged a character.  All the characters were so well developed that I found myself empathizing with each one.  This book was thoughtfully written and somehow all the little secrets stay hidden until the end.  And everyone is hiding something.  Hillier has written a fast-paced psychological thriller that’s full of suspense and will have you on the edge of your seat turning page after page until the very end.  You will be pulled in right from the beginning so once you start it, I suggest that you don’t make plans for the rest of the day.",5,0,2108,0.106,0

A Stroke of Malice is the latest in the long running Lady Darby series and as such, I would recommend reading the previous books in the series to get the most enjoyment out of this one; the mystery works as a stand-alone, but many of the characters have appeared in previous books.After the events of the previous book, Kiera, Lady Darby, and her husband Sebastian Gage have agreed to attend a house party hosted by the Duke and Duchess of Bowmont for 12th Night.  Kiera has been working on a painting of the Duchess and will continue to work on it while visiting their remote castle in Scotland.  In addition to Kiera and Gage, Kiera's sister Alana, brother-in-law, and brother are also in attendance.  The duke and duchess are both somewhat scandalous; it is common knowledge that the duchess's younger children are not the duke's even though he has acknowledged them as such.  During a ball to celebrate the season, Lord Edward takes some of the guests, including Kiera and Gage, on a ghost tour of the castle.

Bound by a vow to never speak or make contact with another individual, May’s only connection in the world is the town’s previous sin eater, who she is apprenticed to.  The two quickly grow close, in spite of the forced silence between them, and soon find a comfortable rhythm in their lives.  This calm is not meant to last, however, and May’s sense of peace is shattered when her mentor gets arrested for refusing to eat one of the sins present on a coffin, because it was not one the deceased had confessed.  May is left as the sole sin eater in the town, caught in a web of royal conspiracy with no way to tell others what she has seen, but sometimes being invisible is the best way to get to the bottom of a mystery.You can get your copy of Sin Eater today from Atria Books!Megan Campisi created a compelling alternate history in Sin Eater!  The world is sent in a slightly shifted version of 16th century England, and is full of references to a history that almost happened.  Dealing with a version of the divide between Catholicism and Protestantism (and the royal issues that accompany both of those in this period), this book was a delicious read for a history nerd like myself!  Though Sin Eaters did not exist in a form like this book, Campisi’s tale was inspired by accounts of historical Sin Eaters and what their lives may have looked like.If you like twisted history with a mystery to solve, Sin Eater would be a fantastic pick for your next read!  The story kept me guessing until the last minute, but I found myself enjoying even the more mundane moments in May’s life.

145,"In many ways Rubin can be seen as a perfect embodiment of the current era of weaponized ignorance.  He claims to be interested in ideas but you would never know it from this awful book.  It's easy to criticize DON'T BURN THIS BOOK for its pedestrian writing, its unfunny jokes, and its typos and errors (was this thing even edited?).  All of this is par-for-the-course for these kinds of topical political books (coming to a remainder stack near you!).  What's really offensive here is the lack of intellectual curiosity throughout, as evinced by his handling of various topics.  For example, he cites a libertarian journalist as evidence that climate change is ""part BS"" and yet wouldn't someone who was interested in ideas also cite a climatologist?  What could explain this odd omission?When Rubin launched his channel, he claimed that he was interested in hearing all sides, but all Rubin has done is abandoned the purportedly dogmatic ""political correctness"" of the left in favor of the right's own brand of ""patriotic correctness.""  In the past, Rubin has defended himself against claims that his internet show was becoming a conservative echo-chamber by saying that only conservatives were willing to engage him.  Despite these dubious claims (there are a number of left-leaning commentators who had been given the cold shoulder by Rubin), what exactly is his excuse here?  There is nothing at all preventing him from citing from left-leaning sources in his book.  The reason why he doesn't is that Rubin is not interested in ideas but only rehashing conservative talking points.  Some of these are boiler-plate ""small government"" advocacy, but the book sometimes veers in Dinesh D'Souza levels of lunacy... at one point, he claims that the name ""Nazi"" is an acronym (?!) for National Socialist German Workers' Party and then proceeds to imply that the presence of the word ""socialism"" means that Hitler was on the left.  Just a shocking level of historical illiteracy on display here, to say nothing of reading comprehension (here's an idea: perhaps Rubin should look up the definition of acronym before he decides to pontificate about the ideological roots of fascism).",1,5,2178,0.119,1
146,"It’s difficult to review this book as there are many things about it I did not like at all, but the story was so intriguing, I couldn’t put it down.  The plot was clever and kept taking unexpected turns, although as I finished the book, I could see major holes in the plot that aren’t obvious when reading.The book is full of double standards, with women hating other women and calling each other the most ugly and vulgar names imaginable, mostly fighting over men who betray them but whom the women continue to worship and consider blameless, saving all their venom and violence for other women.  Why would anyone be angry at a total stranger and hold innocent the man who promised to forsake all others and lied and cheated and disrespected them?  Blaming the other woman is quite silly as if it hadn't been her, it would have been someone else.In general, the book is not well written.  At times, the author uses page after page of filler material, going back into a character’s past, in tedious prose.  There is a lot of telling and not showing.  We are told the female main character is a successful businesswoman who runs a chain of expensive salons, but she doesn’t seem very involved, unlike other people who own businesses.  Her husband, meanwhile, is always working, except when he’s with other women.  There’s a lot of telling about how rich they are and how they are involved in so many charities and such, but again, it’s just to present the whole rich people scenario rather than being carried through.If you are as bored as I am by vulgar language used ad nauseam, this book is not for you.  The “f”-word is the author’s favorite adjective.  And why any woman would call another woman such vulgar, degrading names (anatomical and sexual) is beyond me; I have been angry at times with other people, but it never occurred to me to use such words.  It disturbs me that a female author (or any human) has them in her vocabulary and needs to use them against other women.There are many books that have good plots and are also well written.

They meet in Lake Tahoe and decide to spend the summer together getting to know one another and find out all they can about their biological parents.  This is a good subject for a book, but it was not as good as I thought it would be.Serenity is dealing with finding out her husband is a pedophile, and she is feeling the ramifications of turning him in and testifying against him.  Regan is dealing with having an office ""affair"" and ending up pregnant with her married bosses baby.  Lorelei has just learned her husband had an affair with her best friend and got the friend pregnant.  Throw in three brothers who are spending the summer next door to the sisters, a former brother in law/new boyfriend and a guy who one sister spends the summer texting and it gets a little confusing.I wish the story had just dealt with the sisters and their journey to find out how they were related.  There really wasn't a need to bring in all of the other men, other than Lorelei's husband.  The others just didn't make sense.  The fact that Lorelei was not as upset with Regan as someone probably would be (the whole cheating with a married man and ending up pregnant) did not seem plausible either.  Especially since they did not reall know one another.  And what woman leaves her 4 year old daughter with three single men that she barely knows?  It just seemed like the men (the brothers next door, Sawyer, and Rally) were thrown into the book BECAUSE it was a ""romance"" genre book.What really bothered me was the way the sister's were related.  All products of a priest raping young girls, some just teenagers.  There is enough of that in real life without bringing it into fiction.  I would have preferred for the to have been products of a con man over a rapist.I have read some other books of Novak's and they are good.  Typical ""chick flick"" books if you will.

Why is that so important?  Because it moves the book from ""a quick read on the train ride home"" to ""a serious resource that I can tap into, over and over"".The book is easy to read and engage with - simple concepts that flow thematically, backed up by a mix of case studies, anecdotes and considered experience.  BUT it is not trivial and packs a punch.  You want to roll the ""Idea-Driven"" approach into your workplace?  Then you had better be prepared to work at it.  The authors spell this out in clear and simple terms - a successful Idea-Driven approach needs the organisation to be structured, the culture aligned and the right systems and processes implemented.Vertical alignment, horizontal alignment, framing goals in language that makes sense, questioning accepted ways of cascading goals, linking interests and actions across Business teams/departments so that ideas flow seamlessly - these are all called out and spoken about with substance and serious intent.""Becoming idea driven involves more than simply layering an idea process onto an existing organisation.  The entire organisation must be aligned to support the development and implementation of ideas"".  Brilliant.I am so happy to have received this book and look forward to reading it over and over, picking up new lessons and insights each time.

Now, they have moved to another house where all of them will live together.  Maggie is very distressed about Simon living with them.  She is intent that she does not like him and simply wants her Dad.  Connor is handling things better and he and Simon do some sports things together.  Simon professes to love Nina.  He has money from other investments, in addition to his school teacher salary and can take care of them all without Nina needing to work.  But she is determined to get a job and no longer be dependent on a man after some things she learned about Glen.  Maggie persists in saying that there is another part of Simon that only shows up now and then and it’s frightening.  Could this loving man not be who he seems to be or is the child imagining things?This book at first seems to drag and you want to roll your eyes at some of the characters as they seem so naive.  But as we approach the end of the book, it all comes together and leaves the reader with their mouth open in awe.  What a read.  I was racing through it at the end and holding my breath.

150,"The Englisch Daughter by Cindy Woodsmall & Erin Woodsmall has Jemima Graber in a tailspin when she learns that her husband has been hiding a secret that could devastate their family.  Jemima is shocked when Roy tells her that he has depleted their savings account which means the end of her food truck dream and that he has a daughter with an Englisch woman.  Jemima must care for the infant while dealing with her raging emotions.  Abigail Graber, Roy’s sister, is shocked by her brother’s actions, but she does not have time to dwell on it when one of the horses becomes sick.  Worried that it is a deadly disease that could wipe out their entire line of horses, Abigail works with the new hired hand, Chris Fisher.  Abigail has not been able to give her heart to another.  She does find herself attracted to Chris who has secrets of his own.  The Englisch Daughter is a complex Amish story with realistic characters and situations.  This is an intense book with strong emotions.  I found The Englisch Daughter to be different from other Amish novels I have read.  Very unique for the genre.  I was surprised that the Amish in this community used cell phones and called for Uber rides.  I was not familiar with the EHV1 disease that horses can get before this novel.  It could quickly kill off every horse if the owner was not vigilant and quickly took the proper precautions.  I liked that Jemima and Abigail had a dream of opening their own food truck selling authentic Amish food.  This is something I have not encountered in any other Amish novel that I have read.  I especially enjoyed the ending of The Englisch Daughter.  The Englisch Daughter is a story about assumptions, misconceptions, betrayal, dreams, faith and forgiveness.  My favorite line from The Englisch Daughter is “Even a blind squirrel finds a nut every once in a while.” Fans of Cindy Woodsmall will be delighted with this book.  The Englisch Daughter is a well-written, one-of-a-kind Amish novel.*I voluntarily read an advanced copy of this book.  I am not required to leave a review.

151,"Fourteen-year-old May is arrested for stealing bread.  She receives a life sentence of becoming a Sin Eater, a person who eats ritual foods to symbolize the sins of those that are dying.  May finds another Sin Eater who she learns from, but when they are called to a death in the castle, a deer heart sits on the coffin, although the deceased did not commit a murder.  When the elder Sin Eater refuses to eat the heart, she is murdered.  May eats the heart and vows to find out why it was placed on the coffin, who put it there, and to avenge the other Sin Eater’s death.Let me start by saying that I had never heard of a Sin Eater before I read this book.  It is such an interesting concept where one human must eat ritualistic foods that represent another person’s sins so they can go to heaven rather than hell.  I liked May as a character and enjoyed her journey and growth throughout the book.  She was forced to be something no one wants to be, but makes the best of it by trying to find out why people are being murdered and accused of crimes they did not commit.  We have to remember that she is only 14-years-old and has to survive as an outcast while trying to learn the truth about what is going on in the castle.There is an interesting cast of characters throughout this book, but at times, I found there were too many to keep track of.  It was a bit confusing with so many characters including all of the royalty and past queens.  I found myself struggling to remember who was who.  The middle of the book moved slowly and although the pace picked up towards the end, I felt that the ending was rushed and things were left unanswered.  I do not know if a sequel is planned, but maybe that is why not everything was figured out by the end.  Overall, the story was interesting and it was definitely a cool concept, but I felt the book was a little long and confusing at times.Thank you NetGalley and Atria Books for an advanced copy in exchange for my honest review.",3,0,1977,0.123,0
152,"This is the 6th edition in this series and after the last book I was uncertain how this would continue.  Jane Steward is the manager and owner of Storyton Hall with her Aunt and Uncle and they are the guardians of rare and sometimes dangerous books.  The family has been guarding for centuries and Jane is beginning to sell off and donate to museums some of their treasures to avoid the murders that have occurred over the years.  As Jane and her staff and her friends are all gearing up for Valentine’s Day as well as a Children’s book conference there is another murder on the grounds.  For the upcoming conference they have created a whole village for the children and families that will also be coming.  As she shows her friends they discover the body of a woman dressed like Little Red Riding Hood who has an expensive Grimm’s Fairy Tale book in her basket and she has apparently eaten a “poisoned apple”.  She is working with Sheriff Burns to identify the young lady and the Fins (protectors of the Guardian) are working to protect their guests and conference goers.  Soon one of the conference attendees is missing and she is also found staged as the Snow Queen with a Han’s Christen Anderson book found in her room.  Who would want to commit some acts of violence and what is the connection.  Edwin has returned from one of his excursions and vows to help when the twins have been threatened.  This is such an engaging and intricate mystery that as I am reading I wonder how did the author put this all together.  Working with the local police, Jane and her Fins they of course figure it all out and I love that the book does not end there.  They finish the rest of the story with what is going on in the rest of the character’s lives.  Eloise is engaged and Jane is ready to open her family to Edwin.  See lots of opportunities for the next is the series (London, Cooking competition..).  Can’t wait for the next installment.  This series is an automatic buy for me.

153,"Through NetGalley, I received a free copy of A BAD DAY FOR SUNSHINE (Book 1 of the Sunshine Vicram Series) by Darynda Jones in exchange for an honest review.  We meet Sunshine and her daughter Auri on their first day of work and school in Del Sol, New Mexico.  Del Sol’s a quirky little town that Sun thought was forever in her past, but she returned after she was unexpectedly elected to be the new sheriff; the unexpected part comes from the fact she never entered the race or ran for the position.  When a muffin basket of doom is delivered to the sheriff’s office, Sun’s new employees let her know they signal that the office is in for a bumpy few days.  The first day of doom begins when a distraught mother crashes into the sheriff’s office to report her daughter missing and probably kidnapped.  Sun’s past as a kidnapping victim adds to her determination to find the teen and return her safe.  Levi Ravinder, the man Sun’s been unrequitedly crushing on since infancy, becomes a part of the kidnapping investigation and, perhaps, a part of other investigations and troubles that crop up during the following days of doom.  Meanwhile, Auri faces off with high school bullies and helps search for the missing teen.CAUTION: DO NOT expect this to be a reboot or a continuation of the Charlie Davidson series.  So far, there’s nothing supernatural in the book (besides the muffins of doom).  Also, though Sun has an offbeat sense of humor, she’s not even close to being the utterly ridiculous character that Charlie was.  So, if you are a fan of Darynda Jones and won’t be disappointed that this is an entirely new series, please proceed.That being said, this was a great start to a completely new series!  I liked the characters and the plotline.  Though some of the future plot surprises may only surprise the book’s characters, I really look forward to the next book.  I recommend this book to fans of mysteries featuring kidnappings, law enforcement, quirky and/or damaged characters, offbeat humor, literary hot guys, and mysterious origin stories.",5,0,2055,0.124,1
154,"Tom Clavin is, above all, an excellent writer.  A book of history, no matter how interesting the subject, is of little use if it is dry and boring.  Make no mistake, this is a properly foot-noted (and I always read every footnote), well-researched work of scholarship in which the writing flows, carrying the reader along with it.  It was a pleasure to read.The story of Tombstone, the Earps, Doc Holliday and the legendary shoot out at the OK Corral is well known, but not well understood.  Too many untrue tales, too many movie dramatizations, too many people who had agendas other than the truth have obscured what exactly happened in October 1881, and its aftermath.  In “Tombstone” Clavin cuts through the clutter allowing us to see and understand what has become a seminal event in American history.One of the things I really appreciated about this book was Clavin’s explanation of how the rumors about the Earps’, especially Wyatt’s, involvement with the outlaw cowboys got started.  For more than a hundred years there has been unfounded speculation that the Earps had, to one extent or another, thrown in with the criminal gang(s) known as the cowboys.  Clavin shows convincingly that the Earps were on the side of law and order, and that what has been made to look like corruption was in fact merely politics.I am not going to rehash the meat of “Tombstone.”  You will want to read that for yourself.  I will say that Clavin’s account of the various personalities is extremely interesting, and he doesn’t pull any punches.  Josephine Marcus’ time as a prostitute is not glossed over, nor are the men’s characters.  The footnotes, and I am a footnote junkie, are excellent.I heartily recommend “Tombstone.”  It is a complete look at the events which transpired there; how the various actors in the story got to Tombstone, what they did, and why, and Wyatt and Doc’s hunt for the malefactors afterwards.  If you have any interest in the period at all, this is the book for you.Thanks to the publisher and NetGalley for the ARC.  The opinions are my own.",5,0,2061,0.108,1
155,"As a small business owner, reading Maxwell's book helps to define my eternal questions: ""What's working?  What's not?""  With concise ideas and concepts, this book helps individuals to define their dreams on their own terms.We all have dreams.  Sometimes we hear about other people's dreams because it has made them famous, like Martin Luther King, Jr.  Sometimes we hear about other people's dreams because we want to help, like Make a Wish Foundation.  Sometimes we hold onto our own dreams, not sure what to do with them or how to make them a reality, and so we keep them quiet.In Maxwell's book, he is showing us how to bridge the gap between the quiet dreams that we think about and the dreams that have been put into action and, therefore, put into the world, where everyone can enjoy them.  What's the difference between these two - the dream-thinker and the dream-achiever?Maxwell gives us a step-by-step action plan to bridge the gap of difference between them.  There aren't 101 things to do.  There aren't 55 sure-fire ways to make it happen.  There isn't even one answer given.With 40 years of experience as a mentor, Maxwell sets us up for success by asking 10 simple questions.  He is not there to provide the answers, as much as he wants us to seek out the answer within ourselves.The questions fall under 10 categories regarding the precision of your own dream, such as:Ownership: ""Is this really my dream?""Clarity: ""Do I see clearly what I want?""Reality: ""Is this within my own control?""Passion: ""Is this compelling enough to follow?""Path: ""Do I have a strategy, a road map, to follow my dream?""People: ""Who are the people who can help me to make my dream a reality?""Cost: ""Am I willing to pay for my dream to come true?""Tenacity: ""Am I getting closer to my desired result?""Fulfillment: ""Does this make me feel fulfilled?""Significance: ""Does this help others?""With these 10 simple questions, the reader is allowed to dream, to visualize, to respond, and to put ideas into action.  A greater sense of purpose comes with reading Maxwell's book and answering these 10 questions.  Isn't this the point of our dreams, anyway?",5,0,2136,0.178,0
156,"Tombstone, Arizona, is a historical town full of legend, gunslingers, gamblers, drinkers, and family lore.  Most of what we know is based on romantic recounting, much of which is hoopla and falsehood.  Noted journalist Tom Clavin, in “Tombstone,” has shined his reporter’s light on this long misrepresented Western town, providing a detailed history of its existence including authentic stories of the Earp clan and the much-discussed Shootout at the OK Corral.  I am excited about the results.The Earp family, under the patriarch Wyatt, generally formed the main constituency of the law enforcement efforts in the lawless community.  Doc Holliday, another infamous character about which many falsehoods exist, was a habitual follower of the group and his own intriguing story is chronicled.  Most readers of Western lore have glossed over what Tombstone really was and zeroed in on the more infamous events in its existence.  In reality, it was a complex existence filled with ambiguities, bad actors, behavioral excesses, and some cowardice that occurred in the efforts at taming it.Throughout Clavin’s reporting, I was amazed at how many bad actors were actually in existence at the time.  Cowboys, as these rough characters came to be known, were in and out of the town, spreading their malfeasance around like a disease.  The ranchers were largely supportive because they used the illegal activities as a basis for expanding their empires.  The confusing roles of the law enforcement officers and their allegiances, if not totally understood, demonstrate why the illegal activity flourished.  The exasperated citizens had every reason to be wary and unhappy.Clavin’s prodigious knowledge of the activities is on display.  The events unfold before the reader’s eye as in a portrait, aided by minute detail and picturesque splendor.  The writing is clear and grammatically excellent.  The research is immense and beautifully organized.  The history of Tombstone is revealed and the ambiguities of past accounts are removed.  This is a great book for those interested in remote corners of US history.Schuyler T WallaceAuthor of TIN LIZARD TALES",5,0,2146,0.109,0
157,"Patricia Campbell is a housewife and mother living in a suburban area of Charleston, South Carolina.  Her daily life consists mainly of dealing with her unappreciative children and a marriage that grows more and more stale with each passing month.  The one and only joy in her life seems to derive from getting together with her fellow wives and mothers for their women's book club reading discussions.  These meetings provide a well-needed opportunity for Patricia to feel valued and appreciated in a way that she really doesn't most of the time.The club get-togethers often devolve into sensational gossip that don't really pertain to the topic of whichever book is on the schedule.  These gossiping sessions span a wide variety of topics from the infidelity of a certain husband in their neighborhood to the latest scandal or tragedy being reported ad nauseam on cable news.  So when a mysterious stranger by the name of James Harris moves into their community, it is only natural that this will be next burning subject for the book club to debate.  James is fairly handsome, well-spoken, and intriguing to Patricia on a number of different levels.  She immediately becomes interested in his comings and goings (often times very late at night).Patricia's imagination regarding the town newbie further runs wild when a few children go missing in and around the vicinity of her home.  Speculation grows among the book club moms that their newest resident might be involved in the disappearances.  It stands to reason that a True Crime book club would wonder if a real serial killer may be operating in their midst.  And soon Patricia is even conducting her own stakeouts of James in an attempt to uncover his potential hideous crimes.  In doing so however, she may very well have stumbled upon something far far worse than she or the members of the book club ever bargained for.This was one hell of a read I have to say!  THE SOUTHERN BOOK CLUB'S GUIDE TO SLAYING VAMPIRES is equal parts suspenseful mystery, horror, biting satire, and a plain old kick-butt story that will consume you as the chapters fly by.  The publisher's description states that the book is ""Fried Green Tomatoes and Steel Magnolias meet Dracula.""  While I agree with the former, for me the latter was more akin to Fright Night and Disturbia.  It certainly made for a phenomenal combination nonetheless.It was interesting to see Patricia's character develop from a mostly timid wife and mother who just sort of accepted her lot in life, followed a certain schedule etc... to a bold and persistent amateur investigator who stops at nothing to try to uncover the mystery behind what is happening in her neighborhood.  Hendrix does an outstanding job of showing how the lines between fiction and real life can be blurred at times and that talking about True Crime books can make the imagination wander into areas that normal people may not want to particularly go.We've all see this plot before, it's by no means a new one - mysterious stranger moves into town, bad stuff starts to happen, suspicion turns to them, yada yada yada.  Somehow though, Grady Hendrix makes this story feel entirely new and fresh and there are a number of twists that made me not want to put this book down for even a minute.  It's so difficult to write a horror book that both delivers maximum scares and also truly entertains at the same time.  This book walks that line beautifully and is what I believe raises it to a level significantly above most in the genre today.  And the ending is absolutely stunning.If you are looking for a book that will scare the heck out of you, make you snort with laughter, and keep your face glued to it for hours upon hours, you need to read Grady Hendrix's newest book THE SOUTHERN BOOK CLUB'S GUIDE TO SLAYING VAMPIRES. This is a story that every reader regardless of reading taste, will find something to connect with and enjoy.  It appears that Grady Hendrix is continuing to turn heads with his marvelous writing and lucky for us, should be putting out fantastic books for countless years to come!",5,0,4086,0.107,0
158,"A funny anecdote about why I wanted to read this book:  It was a case of mistaken identity.  I thought Ted Templeman was Motley Crue's producer of their earlier albums, but it was actually Tom Werman!  I kept wondering when I was going to get to the part in this book where they covered the antics of the wiley Motley Crue members, but it never came.  A quick google search uncovered my mistake, lol.  But it turns out that Ted Templeman discovered and signed the iconic hard rock band Van Halen, and he produced practically all of their albums.  He also discovered, signed and produced The Doobie Brothers.  Over the years he worked with musical artists such as Van Morrison, Michael McDonald, Nicolette Larson, Ronnie Montrose, Bette Midler, Carly Simon and many others.As a child Ted was exposed to a wide range of musical styles, particularly black r&b music, while working in the music store his grandfather owned.  He learned how to play the trumpet and the drums and found some mild success in a band called The Tikis.  When it was discovered that there was already a band with that name, they went under The Other Tikis.  The band evolved into another entity called ""Harpers Bizarre"" which pulled him from his comfort zone behind the drums and pushed him into the forefront as co-lead singer.  Working in the recording studio he realized that he was more fascinated with working behind the recording console.  He used his musical industry contacts to ask to hang out watching recording sessions.  He was very lucky to have witnessed an incredible recording session for Frank Sinatra as well as Elvis Presley.  While still in Harpers Bizarre, they were fortunate to be a supporting act to The Beach Boys.  They are a great favorite band of mine, so I was thrilled- and hung upon every word- of a backstage practice session conducted by lead Beach Boy Brian Wilson.  Ted marvelled in amazement at how perfect their harmonies blended under the tutelage of Brian, even superior to that of ""The Four Freshman"" whom Brian idolized.  Ted also talked about the exquisite Fender branded musical equipment that The Beach Boys used, finding their live performance sound to be superb.Ted eventually transitioned from musical performer to record producer and vice president of Warner Brother Records.  Ted covers the evolution of The Doobie Brothers from his signing of the band through the intricate details of recording their albums.  After great success, one of the main singers/songwriters in the band had to take leave due to personal issues, which was a major crisis to be navigated.  This is where the great talent of Michael MacDonald was infused into the band.  While it brought wild success, especially with the song ""What a Fool Believes"", Michael's inclusion in the Doobie Brothers changed its previous rock flavor to a more soulful and r&b feel.However, the biggest chunk of the book is devoted to Van Halen!  They came to fame when I was in high school in the late seventies.  I love their first album and songs such as  ""Ain't Talkin' 'Bout Love"" and ""Jamie's Cryin"".  Ted covers everything from soup to nuts with this band.  In his mind, Eddie Van Halen is the greatest lead guitarist that ever existed.  He didn't feel the same about flamboyant singer David Lee Roth, but admired his intelligence, work ethic and incredible talent to write great lyrics on the spot.  Ted also considered it divine providence that all the band members and himself lived about 4 minutes from each other in Pasadena, CA.  Ted also loved the large, cement basement rehearsal area in David Lee Roth's house (his father was a physician) where Van Halen would practice and crank out new material.This book really impressed me with how good it was. The narrative was so well-spoken and sounded like Ted Templeman was just talking to you.  The writing style flowed easily, and I could put the book down and read something else and come back to it without losing a beat.

160,"Disclosure:  I received this book free of charge to review it.Grant is a very focused and intense person, and it comes through his book.  His passion and bluntness is palpable but necessary for a topic that many people tend to shy away from in casual conversation.  Grant starts his journey dead broke living with his parents when he has his wake up call to take ownership of his life.  He walks us through his journey from dependence to independence not only from his family but from having any dependence on a 3rd party.  The book is written like a ""how to"" book with a very detailed set of instructions to help anyone who decides to become financially independent.  I have recently taken this journey and have completed many of the steps to achieve partial financial independance.  Though my discovery, I have stumbled upon many of the recommendations Grant has made.  Having said this, I still was able to learn quite a few new techniques I had not thought of before.For anyone seeking to become financially independent this book will help you avoid many mistakes that could be made along the way.  I think the most critical part of the book is when he discusses how hard he had to push himself to acheive his goals in such a short period and became burned out in the process.  This brutal honesty is necessary for anyone who tries to spread themselves too thin in trying to achieve what Grant has done.I was able to read this book in 4-5 hours, but I also have a tremendous amount of experience in personal finance, investing and side-hustling.  For the novice, I think it would take twice as long since it has details that would require further contemplation and even research to understand fully.  He tends to refer to his website quite a bit so I suspect that the novice would need to read many of his blog posts and use his tools to get a better handle on the subject matter.Overall I really enjoyed reading his book and look forward to implementing some of his ideas into my own life.",5,0,1994,0.118,1
161,"My initial impression of ""The Love Story of Missy Carmichael"" and Beth Morrey's writing was this book is similar to Fredrik Backman's novels and his writing style.  There was an elderly protagonist, a curmudgeonly woman, who would provide wisdom and insights with respect to her past and her relationships to those around her.  In that I was correct.However, the book proved my impression incorrect.  Missy Carmichael was not as engaging nor as humorous as Backman's characters.  When Morrey introduces us to Missy, her withdrawal from life was nearly complete.  It is only through sheer will that Missy leaves her home to attend a fish stunning where she meets individuals who will bring her back to life and humanity.  Because she misses her grandson, who has moved to Australia, Missy is drawn to Otis a young boy who reminds her of Arthur.  Otis' mother, Sylvie, is an extrovert and an individual who charges through her own life and that of others.Eventually asked by Sylvie to care for ""Bob"" a small dog that belongs to her friend, Missy reluctantly agrees to give Bob a temporary home.  As the novel moves forward, the reader sees a transformation in Missy and begins to understand the impact her love for others has made on her life, resulting in her loneliness and self-imposed isolation.  It is only in the final chapters that Missy's full background story becomes clear and garners sympathy from the reader.  Beth Morrey depicts the way love may transform an individual, both positively and negatively.Beth Morrey allows Missy and several other characters to evolve and to become real to the reader.  While Missy was not initially a sympathetic individual, when Morrey discloses Missy's past, the reader immediately understands the reason Missy has become as she is.  ""The Love Story of Missy Carmichael"" is a very good book; it is easy to read and has interesting characters who appeal to the reader.  This would be an excellent book for book clubs as it provides numerous discussion points that are hidden in the story.",4,0,2032,0.163,0
162,"What a frustrating and amazingly beautiful story!!!  I loved the storyline…..2 broken souls learning to heal and finding love again.But I have to tell you….I was ready to smack Ty on so many occasions.  I thought my rage and frustration ran strong for Brock in book 1…..well Ty beat him by a mile.  But even saying that I LOVED this story.What I have always loved about Kelly Elliott’s books is the small town country feel she gives us in her stories.  She always makes me want to move to Texas and now Montana.  She gave us great characters in this book and a storyline that will keep you interested.Always Enough is the second book in Kelly’s Meet Me in Montana series.  This is a standalone novel, but I would definitely recommend reading this series in order.  We meet Ty and Kayleigh in the first book, so I think that will help build into their story.  I thought the pace and flow of this story worked well and this was a well written book.  It is told in Dual POV.  I will say that this book didn’t deal with the bull riding aspect as much as book 1….I kind of missed it, but with Ty I didn’t expect it because of his history.In this book we follow Ty and Kaylee’s story.  Ty is the oldest Shaw brother and he has suffered a major injury that has taken his bull riding days away from him.  Ty has gone through many challenges and ups and downs.  With his life not going in the direction he saw for himself, he has shut himself off to everything that can make him “feel”.  That is until he meets Kaylee and she flips his world upside down!!!  Can Kaylee open up Ty’s heart??  Make him see there is more to life??  Read this book to find out.I loved that we got to see all the same characters from the first book in this one.  I also liked getting to know Tanner (the youngest shaw brother).  I look forward to reading his book next!!!If you love Kelly Elliott’s books, then you don’t want to miss out on this newest series of hers.",5,0,1937,0.211,1

Six years later, Bess returns to reclaim Clara only to discover to that someone—using her name—reclaimed the child the day after Bess left her at London’s Foundling Hospital.  She does not know how an individual knew the correct information to give to claim Clara.  Bess is determined to discover who took her daughter and why they did it.  Not far away, a widow of means lives a quiet life with her daughter.  They only venture outside on Sunday for church.  Her one friend is kindly local doctor.  He suggests that she hire a nursemaid and introduces her to one.  The widow is reluctant to add someone to her orderly home, but she agrees after seeing how the child and nursemaid get on together.  The widow has a secret, though, that if discovered could change everything.  The Lost Orphan is an engaging historical novel.  I was drawn into the story and was reluctant to put it down to get chores done (the cats were determined to get their dinner though).  I found it to be well-written with realistic characters.  The author captured time and place.  I could tell Stacey Halls did her research.  I thought the plot was captivating.  It is told from Bess’s and the widow’s point-of-views.  We get to see the situation from both perspectives which I appreciated.  There is some foul language (very little) in the story along with some violent situations (just so you are aware).  The author provided vivid descriptions which really bring the story alive.  The Lost Orphan is a raw and gritty story that draw you in from the very first page.*I voluntarily read an advanced copy of this book.  I am not required to leave a review.

164,"Military historians have long debated what happened to the Hunley, a hand-driven submarine used by the Confederacy during the waning years of the American Civil War to carry out the first successful torpedo attack by a submersible.  These hypotheses vary, and include asphyxiation and blast damage from its own torpedo.  But no one could definitively say what happened, even after the wreck of the Hunley was discovered, raised and studied, until now.In the Waves chronicles one person's quest to solve this question once and for all, and she appears to have done it!The narrator is a graduate student at Duke University, North Carolina, USA.  She spends years working out the math, the physics, and designing and carrying out experiments that model what happened that fateful night back in the 1860s.This book is not just about the Hunley though, it's about all kinds of things:- Professional (or unprofessional) rivalries / petty territoriality- What is means to be a graduate student working towards a PhD- How science is done- What it takes to generate sufficient data to reject long-held pre-conceived notionsSo, if you are interested in reading, about a deep mystery, challenges of graduate school, and learning in considerable detail about setting up and running a series of linked experiments (including getting academic and local legal permission to explode charges of black powder, over and over and over), then this book might be for you.As someone who has worked through the rigors of earning a PhD, here is my final assessment and recommendation.Assessment - a good story that is told well (i.e., the writing does not get in the wayRecommendation -1) For the person with interests in mathematics/physics = 4/52) For the person with interests in Civil War History = 4/53) For the casual reader = 3/5 (many casual readers will most likely lose interest once they get into the politics of graduate school or the details of experiments in applied physics - I mean, I had to simply decide that I was going to  push through and finish)All in all, I'll say 4/5",4,0,2066,0.088,1
165,"John Grisham takes his readers back to Camino Island, an offshore vacation destination between Jacksonville and Savannah off the east coast of Florida.  Now he introduces us to Leo, a bad boy hurricane that seems relentless in its efforts at demolishing the little community.  And Leo does bad things, devastating homes and condos, leveling hotels, destroying businesses, flooding streets and roads, shutting down the power, and killing a dozen people.  One of the fatalities, well-known author, Nelson Kerr, appears to have been murdered at the height of the storm, his head injuries not consistent with the storm’s furies.Bruce Cable, a friend of Kerr’s and proprietor of Bay Books, wonders if some of the shady doings in Kerr’s stories might have alarmed some criminals in the lucrative rest home business who think they are being outted in the latest of Kerr’s novels yet to be published.  The shady characters in the novel, Cable posits, might be real people reluctant to have their enterprise of defrauding elder patients with dementia into living a little longer, and jacking up receipts from insurance companies for already crooked rest homes.  Then employees begin blowing the whistle on the homes, claiming everything from illegal medication to rape of helpless patients.  Local authorities are overwhelmed by Leo’s destruction and unable to fully investigate the possible healthcare violations.  Could the answers be right there on the author’s computer in his manuscript?  Cable wants it all stopped and decided to investigate with some of his friends.It’s a breezy book, easy reading, and Grisham does his usual outstanding work keeping the plot line simple, the characters easily defined, and the dialogue easy to follow.  It’s a formula that works well for him and sells a lot of books.  That’s why you can never go wrong selecting Grisham for your partner whenever you see a new book of his come out.  He’s a pleasure to read and a welcome diversion when you want to be entertained by reading a good book.Schuyler T WallaceAuthor of TIN LIZARD TALES",4,0,2065,0.099,0
166,"This was a wonderful start to a new regency series and I can't wait for July when the second one comes out already!  The romance was wonderful.  There were a lot of sweet moments as they tried to navigate their new relationship while keeping their secrets from each other, so some misunderstandings as well.  It was interesting to see how a man dealt with what would be considered PTSD now when they didn't really have a name for it then.  I admired his bravery after serving in the war and his compassion and integrity as he was thrown into being an earl and not knowing what was expected of him while trying to forge a marriage with a woman he didn't know.  He put Diana first right from the start and it was sweet to see him take care of her and protect her.  Also seeing how he cared for fellow soldiers and horses he served with was wonderful.  There were some truly smarmy and conniving men in this story, from Diana's brother and her father to her brother's best friend.  They made me so angry!  I couldn't fathom how she survived in her father's household at all and I really felt for her as she had no control over her future before she married Evan and then was thrown into a marriage with a complete stranger.  I liked seeing her gain confidence in who she was as she designed, decorated and oversaw the estate being renovated.  Both Evan and Diana were Christians, though Evan seemed to have a stronger faith while Diana questioned if God heard her as all of her prayers seemed to go unanswered in the beginning.  Marcus was a wonderful and wise friend to Evan and I grew to really like him while wondering what secrets he kept.  I was excited to see the second book will be about him!  There were some suspenseful moments in the story as well.  I highly recommend this book!I received this book free from Read with Audra and Kregel.  I was not compensated for this review.

167,"I was given a copy of The 28 Day Pescatarian Meal Plan & Cookbook: Your Guide to Jump-Starting a Healthier Lifestyle via the publisher.  I chose to review this cookbook and my opinion is freely given.The first third of this cookbook is dedicated to explaining the pescatarian diet and giving weeks of pre-planned menus.  The diet is plant-based, with the addition of seafood as a primary protein source.  The author describes the principles of the diet and the scientific basis for it.  With essential pantry items, tools, a handy guide regarding selecting and preparing seafood, and an excellent chart with cooking times for different preparations, The 28 Day Pescatarian Meal Plan & Cookbook gives newcomers all of the information they need for success.  There are 4 weeks of menu plans, complete with a shopping list for each week.  The author's intention is to give newcomers a solid footing in the diet before sending them out on their own.The recipe sections are as follows, with some of the standout dishes listed:Breakfast: Oat Flour Blueberry PancakesSoups and Salads: Easy Israeli Shrimp Salad; Roasted Vegetable Panzanella Salad; 10 Vegetable SoupVegetarian Mains: Mushroom and Red Bean Tacos; Lentil Sloppy Joes with Tangy Cabbage Slaw; Marinated Tofu Greek SaladFish and Seafood Mains: Sheet Pan Jerk Fish Tacos; Bruschetta Branzino; Cajun-Spiced Snapper with Pineapple Salsa; 30-Minute Coconut Shrimp CurrySnacks and Sides: Roasted Red Pepper and White Bean Hummus; Garlicky Roasted Green Beans with LemonDesserts: Chocolate Chip Cookie Bars; S'mores Cookie Skillets; Blender Black Bean BrowniesOverall, there is a lot to like about The 28 Day Pescatarian Meal Plan & Cookbook: Your Guide to Jump-Starting a Healthier Lifestyle.  There are many recipes that I will delight in trying, though I do wish that certain sections had more variety.  The biggest drawback to this cookbook is the fact that there are few photographs of the finished dishes.  I also wish that the author had spent less time on the menu planning and more time on the recipes themselves.

168,"A staid, overly-organized lonely single dad's prosaic life is turned topsy-turvy when a woman falls from a bridge and he leaps into the river and saves her.  The Secrets of Love Story Bridge is the latest from an author who is steadily becoming an auto-buy for me as I linger over the taste the multi-flavored story she just served up.The Secrets of Love Story Bridge introduces yet another whimsical, engaging character from this author who can make dull and average turn into something effervescent after a steady journey of the heart that is rarely taken alone.  Michell Fisher, the average joe with secret heartache, regrets, and loneliness is accompanied on his journey by his loving, but intrepid nine year old daughter, Poppy who just wants to see her dad happy- oh and get a chance to play and go off her dad's well-ordered schedule for their lives, her bright and sparkling music teacher, Liza, who has a mysterious connection to the woman in yellow he rescued and makes him feel something uneasy, but exciting whenever he's near her, his relationship-addled work buddy Bart, his 'I'll help you bury the bodies' child-hood best friend, Graham, and the charming orgami-making doorkeeper at his flat.There are several threads woven together in this story that Mitchell narrates.  There is his life journey to finding himself and what makes him happy, the mystery of Liza's sister's disappearance, the secret inside the last letter Poppy's mother wrote to Mitchell before she died, and the many stories inside the Love Story Bridge letters and padlocks.A few excitement blips occurred, but mostly this was a gentle-flowing feel-good story that re-establishes letter-writing, ice cream on a hot day, a campout under the stars with marshmallows roasting over the fire and impromptu singalongs as the very best of life.  I've read three of the author's four books and love each of these slow-simmer triumphs that really hit on what is really important while telling an engaging story.  Those who enjoy general fiction with a light romance should definitely pick this up.",5,0,2073,0.251,0

Always one of my favorite tropes, they get to act like they are madly in love, when they cannot help but actually fall in love.Sara Vance lands in Key West just to find out her expected boyfriend is skipping out on the planned family vacation.  Thinking that she must be in a relationship to soothe her mother’s rehabilitation from cancer, she needs a new guy and fast.  Enter our hot local firefighter Luis Navarro.  Luis is a Key West native and just happens to be hanging around the airport pondering how he will spend his forced week off from the squad.  Problem solved for the both of them – fake it til you make it thru the week!There are other concurrent story lines – Sara is a media influencer recovering from an eating disorder and Luis is struggling with painfully memories of lives lost – both personally and in the hazards of his line of work.  Mix in various parental and sibling drama and it makes for a lot of twists on top of the fake/not fake romance.  Luis is my favorite -- strong, loyal, and a calming guide for all the other characters – except for one brother (queue the sibling drama.)  Sara is sweet but a little overly dramatic regarding her family’s perception of her.  I am hoping that Oliveras’ next installment in this series (Keys to Love) will provide some more Navarro Cuban cultural family dynamic.Happenstance puts them together.  Time spent on their Key West Island Affair has them falling into their Happy Ever After.  This was my first read from Priscilla Oliveras and it won’t be the last.

170,"Having read with enthusiasm the other books in the author’s Clare Fergusson and Russ Van Alstyne series, I was delighted to be chosen to read an ARC of the latest one.  I certainly was not disappointed!  Lest you think that you have to read the entire series, you do not because this book can be a stand alone.  I just know that once you have read this one, you will want to read the others!  In this latest one, there is a series of three murders, all decades apart and all eerily alike.  A young woman’s dead body is left in the middle of nowhere in the little town of Millers Kill and the head of law enforcement each time is left stymied as to who killed her and why she was left in their town.  The point of view switches between the different chiefs of police, starting in the 50’s with Chief Harry McNeil, in the 70’s with Chief Jack Liddle and in the present with Chief Russ Van Alstyne.  Following the clues and finding the connections is a real dilemma for Russ, who calls upon his wife, Episcopalian minister Clare, to help follow and solve the mystery.  This was a powerfully written police procedural with some very creative and unexpected twists.  I loved getting to know Clare and Russ again and how their human foibles are presented.  Clare is having difficulty getting used to being a new mother and juggling that with her other responsibilities as well as helping Russ to find out who is disturbing the peace in their little town by dropping bodies there every few decades.  Fans of police procedurals and mystery/suspense will definitely want to read this book!DisclaimerDisclosure of Material Connection:  I received a complimentary copy of this book from the publisher via Netgalley.

The three women will be spending the summer together in Tahoe.  It will give the three women a chance to get to know each other and try to identify their common link.  Each woman is going through a rough patch.  Serenity just finished testifying at her husband’s trial after turning him in to the police.  Lorelei discovered her husband cheated on her with someone unexpected.  Reagan had a one-night stand with someone from work and cannot face returning to her job.  Each woman will need to overcome their issues before moving forward.  One Perfect Summer is a light read that touches on an interesting topic.  Imagine taking a DNA test and finding out you have two siblings.  I liked that the three women who were at an intersection in their lives.  It was touching to see them go from strangers to true sisters.  The point-of-view switches between the three sisters which can be confusing in the beginning until you get used to each ladies’ voice.  It does mean that there is a repetition of information.  It does, though, allow us to understand what each woman is feeling and thinking.  I wanted to find out how the three women were related and came to be separated.  When the solution was revealed, I was surprised because it came out of left field.  I liked Lorelei’s daughter, Lucy and how she helped an injured man.  I did find the pacing a little sluggish and there is foul language (too much) in this book.  I was happy with the epilogue that showed the women rallying around Reagan for an important event.

172,"Set in the fictional Northern California town of Callinas (Bolinas?), near the fog-shrouded edge of the continent where the cliffs drop off into the sea at Point Reyes, “Take Me Apart” is a psychological portrait of Kate Aitken, who is literally falling apart.  Once an up and coming NYC-based journalist, Kate’s life fell apart after she accused a superior of sexual harassment.  In the fall out, she suffered depression.Now, she is starting a new life -at least temporarily- in the hills north of the San Francisco Bay.  It’s a small insular town where her aunt and uncle live and a famous photographer and icon, Miranda Brand, who suffered from many psychiatric ailments took her own life twenty years ago -or did she.  There are still whispers around town that the artist’s 11 year old son, an odd one to be sure, fired the fatal shot.  Of course, that wouldn’t be more than ancient history except Kate has taken a job over the summer with the son, Theo, as the archivist putting some organization to Miranda’s papers and correspondence which are still piled up in a hoarder’s dream in the big old house.  And, the son, Theo, is odd, stand-offish, distant, and quite a bit creepy.The story alternates between Kate’s life now and the correspondence and diary entries from Miranda’s heyday.  Kate is attracted to the strange young man who has so many family secrets, but can’t stop herself from investigating whether Miranda took her own life or was the victim of her son’s wrath or someone else.This is not an action-packed story.  Before reading it, I actually thought more was going to happen than actually did.  There’s little indeed that takes place other than perhaps a budding romance.  It’s more a story about Kate’s inner thoughts and emotions and the connection she has with the woman from the past, Miranda.  It would probably be categorized as more “women’s fiction” than a thriller.  Not my usual genre, but the writing is compelling.  And, it is easy to read and absorbing.",4,0,1989,0.055,1

174,"Why am I reading about this person?  A bio fails if it can't make a compelling case for its subject.  I don't generally expect much more than that from the story of a life. When a bio does something monumental, I have to acknowledge it.  Gopnik's bio of Andy Warhol has me count this among the great bios I've ever read up there with Caro's books on Robert Moses and LBJ.I look to bios to give me a perspective on history or the thing that makes the person important more than that I understand or can relate to the person on a human level.  Rarely can a bio do both things but Gopnick's is that rare book that does.For the first part, the book makes me understand why Warhol was a world changing figure.  It isn't that he was a great artist in the sense that we still cling to, that a person creates a beautiful or highly skilled canvas or sculpture.  It was that he freed art from the shackles of merely the consideration of the object itself.Yes Abstract Expressionism was freed from the shackles of representation but not from the sense of the object.  People still looked at a canvas and considered what the painting communicated in an of itself.  And Pop Art was back to representation but not so much a continuity with art history but as a comment or perspective on the society or culture.  With the advent of time, we can see that Warhol's Campbell Soup paintings weren't any of those things.  The fact that he painted soup cans didn't make them artistic.  The fact that the paintings lacked creativity and that they embodied a brand meant the actual paintings were less powerful than the brand or even of the can itself.  The painting weren't making fun of the brand or the can or of the painting.  The paintings took all of those things at face value; the brand was powerful, the can wasn't the painting and painting wasn't much of a painting.  What this tells us is that the art was a way of looking at the world.And that was Andy only at the very beginning of his exploration of what art could be.  Andy Warhol kept asking the question; is this art? what about this?  and this?  Whether it was the film of someone sleeping, a transcribed stream of consciousness with no discernible form or a magazine or art that's only purpose was to make money or an appearance on the Love Boat,  Andy kept asking if something was art.  He didn't ask if the art was well executed or poorly conceived or made by a single person or even really by a person as we think of that at all.  Was Warhol a sellout?  Yes.  Could Warhol be banal?  Yes.  Was Warhol even an artist?  Maybe not.  It was the questions Warhol asked of art that changed what it could be.  He opened it up to all of us in all kinds of ways.  Unfortunately, he couldn't give us all his endless specific ability of challenging art as both an artist and as a cultural figure year after year that kept the culture asking more of those questions about more things.Gopnik doesn't spoon feed the reader this synopsis.  Like his subject he gives the us the material and leaves it up to us to come up with the questions and concerns Warhol spent his life chasing.  If that was all he had done, that would have been more than enough for me to rave about the book.  But he did something more.  He give us so much of the material of Warhol's life, his art, friends, family, finances, facts of daily life, the many times intimacy failed him.  And these 900+ pages weren't a gossipy trek through the glamorous successes of a great man.  These pages challenged and questioned so much about what Andy's life was about but at the end, I felt the man as a man.  When I saw the photo of Warhol in the back seat of his limo, looking small and vacant, I felt this shy, sensitive and lonely man and cried.",5,0,3745,0.116,1
175,"They Lucky Ones is Liz Lawson's debut novel, and if this story is an indicator, we have a lot to look forward to in her writing.  The Lucky Ones is emotionally raw and gritty.  It is a beautiful story about guilt, grief, and finding yourself among the trauma you have endured.  But probably most importantly, this novel is about resilience, hope, and forgiveness.  Lawson captures the pain of survivor's guilt while at the same time moving toward a future of acceptance and fulfillment.  It is both a beautiful and painful debut that will surely stick with you long after you have finished the final words.The Lucky Ones is told through dual points of view.  First comes May, a survivor of a school shooting which claimed the life of her twin brother.  May was the only one in the band room that day that came out alive.  And almost a year later, she still feels guilt over that day.  Guilt that she didn't do more to save her brother and the others.  Guilt that she had drifted apart from Jordan before he was gone.  And suddenly guilt that maybe it was all her fault.Zach gives us the other point of view.  Zach did not go to same high school as May and the other victims, but his mother is a lawyer who has taken on the task of defending the shooter.  Because of this, Zach has lost almost all that he has ever known.  His girlfriend has left him.  One of his closest friends has abandoned him.  Others at school treat him as an outcast because his mom has taken on the case.  All he has left is his best friend Conor, who has been by his side throughout.  Conor is all he has until he happens to cross paths with May.  They find an unlikely friendship in each other.  One that isn't always easy, but is most definitely worth it.

Several months later Simon Fitch conveniently enters Nina’s life at a time when she realizes her marriage was all a lie.  Vulnerable and seeking companionship, she quickly falls for his charm.  A year and a half later she is attempting to move on with her life and moves in with Simon.  Her son quickly takes a liking to him but her daughter starts to notice that not everything is as it seems and something is off about him.  She starts to see a darker side to Simon that no one else sees.  But is it all in her head?  Or is Simon truly a master manipulator with a dark past?.This is a very well thought out thriller that will have you on the edge of your seat.  A perfect storm leads Nina right to Simon.  But was the storm set up?  While some of this book was predictable, it still stunned me that the author was able to put together so many layers of manipulation.  He expertly delivers a story about how an emotional abuser gradually starts to plant seeds of doubt, controls, manipulates, and isolates victims from others.  It was intense to read and Nina’s daughter, Maggie, saw straight through the gaslighting.  This is one book that will have you questioning if you truly know who you are sleeping next to.  But the biggest takeaway from this book isn’t that.  It’s about not judging others if you haven’t been in their shoes because while you might say you would never stay with an abuser, you won’t actually know that’s what you’d do unless you actually live it..Thank you @netgalley and @stmartinspress {#partner} for gifting me with an advanced readers copy in exchange for an independent and honest review!",4,0,1941,0.102,0

Buck Trammel is an interesting leading character whose past is slowly revealed as readers turn pages.  Buck was once a Pinkerton man, now he finds himself a bouncer in a western town.  From there, the action ramps up when he is forced to leave town and be on the run with the town drunk.  What is quickly apparent is Buck isn’t well prepared to be on the run.  He knows nothing about watching his trail nor does he have a sense of direction.  But what Buck can do is fight bare handed with a Winchester or the Colt at his side.  The drunk turns out to be someone no one knew, and he is better adept at keeping himself and Buck alive until they reach Blackstone, Wyoming.  From that point, we learn who the real man is behind his former drunken ways and we see Buck emerge as a fighter for justice but never without someone trying to shoot at him, especially when he becomes the Sherriff of Blackstone.In a unique and gripping way, the new western series, Buck Trammel, is unlike other western tales.  Sure, there is gun smoke in the air, the undesirable components of town life and more.  However, Buck has an Eastern way about him not to mention his size always set him apart from other men in town.  He befriends the drunk on the trail as they run for their lives, but the drunk named Adam isn’t someone to fully trust even when he is sober.The ending leaves open some romantic possibilities for Buck, and I can’t wait to see how this character develops and what happens between him and Adam in the future.  No two friends could be more different, and their friendship is precarious as they travel different paths and make vastly different choices.  So, grab a copy and enjoy the newest series that expands the Johnstone fictional universe.  You will be entertained and engrossed in the pages for hours!",5,0,1899,0.134,1
178,"The Women with Silver Wings is a fascinating study of the women pilots who against all odds and a good portion of the men they interacted,  with made a significant contribution to the WWII war efforts.  Meticulously researched using among other things oral histories and diaries, the flow of the story is smooth, easy to follow, and filled with lots of gossipy tidbits that make this a wonderful read.  Readers are introduced to the major players, Nancy Love,  Teresa James, Jacqueline Cochran and a host of others who persevered in a world and a profession controlled by men reluctant to allow them to participate.  The story also details the rivalry between Love and Cochran who had very different visions of the role women pilots should play in the war effort.  Both wanted the women to be fully integrated into the Army Air Force, but Jackie Cochran wanted to keep them segregated to protect their morals and reputations.  Nancy Love wanted a full integration.  The author writes of the discrimination leveled by color and ethnicity against women and men during this period and the discrimination against women pilots that continued after the group was disbanded and the war was over.  When “the experiment” began the women pilots were attached to the AAF but were classified as civilians, hence no benefits were given to them.  The widow of a male pilot received $10,000.  The family of a female pilot only received the $250 Civil Service Commission death benefit; nor were the women eligible for the GI Bill in the aftermath.  The struggle for recognition of the contribution made by the WASP pilots continued long past the end of the program in December 1944.  This book is history at its best...reminding old timers  how far women have come in the past 80 years, and giving a lesson to younger readers of what society was like for their great-grandmothers.

As if things can't get any crazier, a very pregnant young woman who is her doppleganger goes into labor at her store and she finds out this woman is her twin sister.  Moments later, she finds out she is one of three triplet girls who were raised separately not knowing the other existed until recently.  Brynne's life has just exploded.  She was raised as an only child but now has siblings and doesn't know how she feels about.  She loved her mother, but the bookstore is not her life.  Can Paul give her the space she needs to figure out what she truly wants?  The Reluctant Fiance is a wonderful story and a great ending to the Taylor Triples Trilogy.  Lynne Marshall created a very compelling and satisfying series that grabs your heart.  This can be read as a stand alone book but I highly recommend reading Cooking Up Romance and Date of a Lifetime, the first two books in the series which focus on Brynne's two sisters and how they found each other and the loves of their lives.  These are great summer reads and make you feel warm and gooey all over.",5,0,1882,0.198,1
180,"The Wise Friend by Ramsey Campbell may very well turn out to be Campbell’s magnum opus.  On the surface it appears to be a marvelous, mystical tale of cosmic horror, one that evokes inexplicable evil up from deep beneath the earth, into the ordinary world of a broken, English family.  “It’s those beneath the earth that feed off your energy.”While young, Patrick, the father, was tainted by a brush with evil as he visited his beloved aunt Thelma, a famous artist who experimented with the unfathomable.  Thelma later realizes her mistake and tries to extricate herself from her quest for buried mysteries and arcane knowledge.  Unfortunately, she had already gone too far.After her funeral, Patrick and his son Roy become fascinated with her journal, one that “smells of the earth.”  The most intriguing element of the journal is a list of sacred sites.  As they begin to read, the nearby “Railway station’s voice turned female, warning listeners to be aware of suspicious items.”  This oblique warning does not dissuade them from developing an obsession that leads them on a perilous journey of exploration—to discover the mysteries of Thelma’s sites—to attempt to understand who Aunt Thelma really was and how she died.While visiting an art museum to view Thelma’s works, Patrick and his son Roy meet a young woman, Bella, who is wise beyond her years-an old soul.  Soon, she insinuates herself into their lives, creating friction between Patrick, a protective and sensitive father, and Julia, a mother who allows her prejudice against Patrick to prevent her from properly safeguarding her son.  Before long, Roy becomes enchanted.Ultimately, it is up to Patrick to solve the mystery of the journal and the sites in order to defend his son and determine the cause of mysterious deaths.“If you don’t go where other people won’t,you’ll never see what’s to be seen.”Campbell wisely chose a first person point of view that draws readers into the mind of Patrick, thus clearly revealing his motivations and drawing readers close, urging them to care for him and his son.  This choice also offers an accurate understanding of Patrick’s volatile family dynamics.All the characters are unique, believable, and authentically flawed.  They stay true to their nature in behavior and thought and will resonate in readers minds long after their literary adventure is complete.It could be said that the most interesting feature of the novel might be the possibility that Campbell speaks through his characters, revealing ominous truths only he has long understood.  Dialogue that hints at long-buried secrets reminiscent of Lovecraft’s old ones appear when least expected.  Tantalizing chapters titles add to the mystery. Campbell’s prose is easy to read, vivid, and detailed without excess.  He creates a visual, palpable world where readers will gladly take up residence.  There is ominous magic on every single page.  Repeated mention of the railway hints at the symbolic nature of rail travel as compared to the journey of those who are spellbound by evil.  Once travelers board a train, they relinquish control, as do all who fly too close to the flame.In the Wise Friend, Campbell does not keep readers waiting.  The mystery begins immediately.  Readers who dislike long introductions will appreciate this quality of Campbell’s highly complex and intertwined plot.  The author preserves the tension by dropping subtle whiffs of mystery all along the journey and including numerous plot twists and surprises.The Wise Friend comes very highly recommended.  It is a true masterpiece of cosmic fiction that will leave readers spellbound and compelled to read and read again in search of more covert hints at long buried mysteries of eternal, sinister entities who slumber serenely and wait for us to draw too close—to fall under their spell.The Wise Friend will leave vigilant readers spellbound, haunted by many disquieting, unanswered questions.Can anyone ever truly win the battle with sinister evil, and who will become the next wise friend?  It could be anyone, even the next reader.rougeskireads",5,0,4093,0.137,1
181,"Chris Guillebeau's latest book isn't just a ""novel of ideas.""  THE MONEY TREE provides real ideas about how anyone can make money, but it's also a real novel, with likeable and believable characters (even the villains are entertaining), nonstop action and plot twists.The book opens with Jake Aarons in a worst-case scenario which isn't too much worse than many people's reality.  His job is in jeopardy because of a ""merger"" (hostile takeover), his student loans are due, his rented condo is being sold out from under him, and he's so preoccupied with all of the above that he neglects the best girl he's ever met.  His brother is also in trouble.  Zack has left his job on the maximum-security campus of IT firm ""Titan"" for a start-up data-mining service disguised as social media, or vice versa, ""Buzzard"" (whose self-designated ""Founder & CEO & COO"" doesn't know his birds from his bees).  (You know the real-world names of these companies, of course.)  The sagas of Titan and Buzzard aren't just comic relief.  They're pictures of the ""two ways"" most people are trapped into making a living:  slave-laboring for conventional, top-down megacorps or investing time and money in overextended and unmanageable start-ups.Thanks to a friend, Jake finds ""The Third Way,"" a group of people who need more money than their paychecks provide, and who also want work that makes a difference in the world.  Through the tantalizing hints of the leader and the tough but supportive critiques of the other members, Jake begins to learn how to solve his problems on his own, step by step, using the methods Guillebeau teaches in his nonfiction.  If you want more details, or just more evidence that you can do this thing, consult Guillebeau's other books, especially THE $100 STARTUP (true success stories from 2009, the last big crash before the present meltdown) and SIDE HUSTLE (the 27-days-to-business-launch plan), but THE MONEY TREE is a stand-alone resource that you can use immediately to teach yourself how to make life-changing amounts of money.",5,0,2043,0.081,1
182,"There are other books about the 1968 World Series, and there may even be other World Series that were more memorable or better played.  But nowhere else can you find the recollections of so many of the players, 50 years on, of a year like 1968.  The 1968 season featured an incredible season-long performance by possibly the most dominant pitcher of his time - Bob Gibson, yet he was arguably eclipsed by Denny McClain's 31-win season and Mickey Lolich's 3-win World Series.  1968 was the last year before the introduction of the divisional playoff system in Major League Baseball - meaning a team had to win the league championship - the pennant - over 162 games, or stay home for the post-season.  In 1968, starting pitchers generally completed their games, whether they won or lost.  Players were paid a living wage, but worked in the off season to make ends meet.  Beyond the world of baseball, 1968 was a year of incredible upheaval, political turmoil and social change.Brendan Donley has done a remarkable job of tracking down the stars and scrubs who featured in one of the most memorable 7-game battles ever.  Simply finding this many players and getting them to talk on record is an extraordinary accomplishment.  But Donley shows an incredible facility in eliciting truly personal, sometimes controversial, often very funny, and incredibly enlightening inside observations and stories from stars like McClain, Willie Horton, Al Kaline, Tim McCarver, Orlando Cepeda and Julian Javier, as well as role players like Tom Matchick and Fred Lasher.  He shows equal deftness in weaving the clips from those interviews together to retell from the players perspective the story that every boy who grew up as a Tiger (or Cardinal) fan in those days knows.The art of the oral history is vastly under-appreciated, and this book serves as yet another example.  If you like baseball, and especially if you were alive in the 1960's, Brendan Donley's ""An October to Remember""  is a must-read.",5,0,1986,0.156,1
183,"I have read most of Mark Rashids books on dealing with horses.  All of them have good life lessons included.  The life lessons are applicable to ones relationships with horses, and as a bonus they often apply to ones relationships with their fellow humans.  The issues that I have is with the style that Mark employs with his books.  The lessons are wrapped in anecdotal recollections, and often leave the reader to decern the lessons, or to interprete them if they are so inclined.  I am not saying that his style is bad, it is just very different from most others the are writing these types of horse training books (a fact he admits to).  Now to this book, I found myself being annoyed with Mark as he lavished anthropomorphic, almost super powers to Buck, the Ranch Horse from which the Life Lessons derived.  I tried to look past this issue because many (most ) of the life lessons enumerated in the book are worthwhile to embrace.  Mark mentioned several times in the book that he ""knew that the reader was probably skeptical of his accounts of Buck"" unfortunately he was right.  It just kept bugging me al the way through the book.  Also, I was put off by his negative portrayal of a few individuals that espoused a different philosophy on such things as barefoot horses, and bitless riding.  I am not saying that he has to agree with these different opinions on how to manage horses, its just that he seemed to make the point that these different philosophies usually came from flakes, and annoying wackos.  Sorry, that just really gave me a lower opinion of him.  As for this book, I would say it is one of the weaker of Mark's books, but if you are a fan of Mark Rashid it is worth getting to add to your library.  If you are not a fan of Mark Rashid, it is worth getting to glean out the life lessons, you will just have to get past all the saccharin-esque fluff.",3,0,1874,0.068,1
184,"There is much I loved about this book.  The harvesting crews that travel each year from Texas to the Dakotas (or in this case, to Idaho) make for an intriguing subject.  Mockett’s writing, as she accompanies one crew, particularly her descriptions of the weather, colors, sounds, and landscape of the Midwest are not only beautifully descriptive but evocative.  It brought me back to the big sky backdrop of my growing up years in Kansas.  Likewise, her depiction of individuals in the harvesting crew and the interplay among them was intriguing.  And, though she admits that her presence with them as a non-contributing member of the crew created some of the tensions that developed, I suspect that it was a greater factor than she admits to.When, however, she decides to provide background information, whether it is about soil or wheat or evangelical Christianity or Native American history, her writing becomes turgid, almost term-paper like.  If one wasn’t already familiar with those subjects, I suppose they would provide some interest.  To me, however, these excurses seemed to reinforce the idea that her knowledge of these subjects came from books rather than from lived experience.It also was not clear what her ultimate thesis was.  It seemed to be a moving target.  Clearly it had something to do with “the divide” that Eric expressed as the reason for different attitudes about evolution.  But was it the “divide” she intended to explore between Urban coastal cities and the vast plains of the Midwest or between non-believers and Christians?  Was that divide really encapsulated in her question about GMO versus organic or was that merely a side issue?  Was it the divide between different branches of Mennonites or between “Jesus followers” and ultra conservative Christians?  Was it the divide between white settlers and the former inhabitants of the Midwest?  Or, was it ultimately the divide within herself, being of a mixed race background, struggling to find where she ultimately fit.",4,0,2005,0.088,0
185,"I’ll admit, with all of the stressors that are going on in the world right now with the COVID-19 crisis, I wasn’t sure if You and Me and Us was the type of book I would like to read right now.  The novel soon proved me wrong and I had a hard time putting it down.  I devoured it quickly and only wished there was more that I could read on the wonderful characters.Alexis Gold is a working mom with a very demanding job and busy life.  Luckily her partner, Tommy, is very supportive.  He works from home and is the primary caregiver to their 14-year-old daughter CeCe.  Alexis and CeCe both find their world shattered when Tommy is diagnosed with stage four small cell lung cancer.  After seeing his mother suffer for five years trying to beat and then ultimately succumbing to cancer, Tommy doesn’t want to put his family through that.  He decides he wants one last summer together in his home town of Destin, Florida, where they have Alexis’s Grandma’s cottage.  Together and apart they all come to terms with the major changes that are happening to them and determine how they will move forward.You and Me and Us is told from the first-person point of view with alternating chapters told from the perspective of Alexis and CeCe.  Alexis and CeCe have a strained mother and daughter relationship and they both love Tommy.  It’s interesting to see their differing viewpoints.  They love one another and are a lot alike, but can’t always see eye to eye.  CeCe wants to be an actress, but Alexis doesn’t want her to be disappointed by failure.  Alexis has never wanted to be married after seeing her parents’ unhappy marriage, but both Tommy and CeCe would love to see that.The storyline and all of the characters were very engaging.  I felt that the emotions and situations were true to life.  As a working mother, I felt Alexis’s pain of loving her job, but wondering if she’s given up too much of herself to work rather than her children.  I also remember being a teenager like CeCe growing up and wanting to be independent, and feeling hemmed in by your mother.  I will admit, I did cry in this novel, but it was at one-part tears of happiness while at another part it was tears of sorrow.  The setting was wonderful in a small Florida coastal town.  Especially with being sequestered in at home now, it was nice to “travel” to Florida in the story.  I loved how Tommy was such a wonderful husband and father.  There had been twist and turns in his life story, but I thought it was so romantic that Alexis and Tommy were childhood friends who eventually found each other again as adults.  The novel concluded with a wonderful last chapter set one year later and it was a perfect ending.The novel also has my favorite items, the P.S. section with information about the author, behind the book essay, and a book club guide.  I was very interested to learn that this was Alison Hammer’s very first novel.  It was so well written and engaging that I couldn’t believe it. I thought it was interesting that the characters have been in her mind in different iterations for twenty years.  I hope that we hear more from them in the future.Favorite Quotes:“Sad that it’s easier for me to tell the world that I love my daughter in a hashtag than it is for me to say it to her face.”“All those years ago, you told me to stay, to stop running away.  You said that life is going to be tough no matter where I went, and that some things were worth sticking around for.  And that’s you.”“…you can’t run away from the hard things in life, because you might end up missing the beautiful moments.”Overall, You and Me and Us was a very engaging story about the beautiful and tragic moments that are life.Book Source:  Review Copy from William Morrow as part of the TLC Book Tour.

186,"This book is a solid start to a new series.  The prologue was so interesting, and frankly, Renata and Castian are two of the most tortured people I’ve read about in a while, and I hope they get to interact way more in the sequel, because anytime they shared a page I was eating the words up.  There’s just something to be said about a haters to lovers romance and I really hope that’s where this is going.  With that said, after the prologue, the book takes more of a slow burn pace.  It sets up this world we find ourselves in and introduces us to several supporting characters, like Dex, who is soon murdered, and which provokes our heroine Renata into seeking revenge in the only way she knows how - by going back to the palace, the place she spent the majority of her childhood, and getting involved with her former guardian to ingratiate herself to the king so she can get close enough to presumably take him, and his son, out.  From there, she begins collecting memories, trying to find a secret weapon and learn all she can about Castian in an effort to kill him in revenge for Dez’s murder.  However, as might be expected, not everything is how it seems.  Honestly, I don’t even care about the war between Puerto Leones and the remnants of the Moria.  The king of Puerto Leones and the justices are your typical evil bad guys, and we aren’t given any solid reason for their actions except what seems to be world domination and a shallow religious excuse, which, in the end, does reflect the Inquisition pretty well.  The Moria don’t seem much better, though, at least from where Renata and Castian are sitting.  I would say this story is definitely more driven by the secrecy and drama surrounding these two characters than the war, which just seems like a reason for all the secrecy and drama to be happening.  I am looking forward to the next book in the series!",4,0,1872,0.132,1

Theirs was not a love match, but they were happy together and all was well until Kitson died when the Salty Dove went down.  Widowed and pregnant, Julia had no choice but to submit to the duke’s will.  Four years later, the duke is still dictating and has made it clear, Julia can do as she wants, but if she wants to raise her son, she will abide by the duke’s rules.  Julia may have found a way to escape the duke and keep her son, she just needs to find the evidence to bring him down.Garrett Stockton was born a gentleman, but unlike his father, he is not content to be dependent on his titled relative.  He takes a ship his father won in a card game and built a successful shipping empire.  While rumored to have a woman in every port, the truth is Garrett has been happily married to the sea, but now he is back in England and longs for a home of his own.  And when he meets Julia, he knows any home he has must include her and her son, so he agrees to help her find a way to outsmart the duke and gain her freedom, but once she is free, will she be willing to give up that freedom for a chance at true love?This was a decent story that starts out strong, but loses steam as the story progresses.  It is well written with likable characters, some amusing moments, a nasty villain, a wonderful hero, very mild love scenes and a HEA complete with an epilogue.  I enjoyed this book, but I don’t think I would re-read it.

188,"This is my first cookbook, and I could not be more excited about it.  I ordered Simple Beautiful Food because I wanted to stretch outside my comfort zone in the kitchen.  Amanda’s book seemed like the perfect resource to make this pursuit more accessible.  It exceeded expectations and has made me much more confident in the kitchen.At first, I was skeptical about being able to take on the challenge.  When it comes to cooking, and baking in particular, I had a limited frame of reference.  But Amanda’s easy-to-follow intro sections provided a solid foundation upon which to navigate the recipes.I decided to start my journey with Lasagna (p.177), a dish that seemed intimidating for someone who had never baked before.  The shopping list on the first page was simple and incredibly helpful, and the best part was that I only had to go to one grocery store.The format of the instructions was perfect for a novice—a concise narrative with bold font for each ingredient and step.  There was just enough detail to demystify the process, but not so much as to be burdensome and overwhelming.The finished product was delicious!  I was blown away by the result because the experience was fun and simple, and my limited supply of kitchen tools was surprisingly sufficient to create a great result.During the preparation, I was convinced that I had messed up a step or two, and I probably did—but that is the magic of Amanda’s philosophy, which defines her approach, selections and recipes.  There’s enough margin for error such that the finished product will delight without sacrificing the stress-free nature of the process.This cookbook has opened the door to more than 100 recipes, and I’m excited to keep going.  From a novice in the kitchen, I give this cookbook an A+.  I highly recommend investing in it for yourself, and perhaps more importantly, for someone you may know who has always wanted to step up their game in the kitchen.

189,"Historian Katherine Sharp Landdeck writes about the women that led and became one of the first women aviators to serve in World War II.  The title of the book gives readers a good glimpse of what to expect ""The Women With Silver Wings:  The Inspiring True Story of the Women Air Force Service Pilots of World War II.""  The stories of each women is no doubt, a unique one that emphasized that there were daring and willing and able women that had heed the call of duty and opened the doors for others to pursue as well -- service in the military during the most pinnacle periods on history.  Parallel to their male counterparts, December 7, 1941 would be a day that would live in infamy but also, a day when the U.S. Army Air Corps sought volunteers.  It is that main factor that drew young women from various walks of life that signed-up such as Nancy Love, Jacqueline Cochran, Cornelia Fort, and many others that were discussed in this book.  And it is that inspiration and attending an air show where she met a veteran of the Women Air Force Service Pilots (WASP) and that led to other meetings with the women that came from the generation that paved the way for women pilots and a close friendship thereafter.  It is these encounters that allowed Landdeck to delve deeper into this part of women and military history that would take a quarter of a century to complete their story.All of the women depicted in the book can be considered the other greater half of the greatest generation of the best and the brightest.  Each women were in their 20s and the one most important thing that they had in common -- they possessed the love and passion for flying.  One of the interesting parts, pilot Jacqueline ""Jackie"" was friends with legendary aviator Amelia Earhart and already had under her belt, being an experienced pilot that entered and competed in various shows and won awards.  Aside from the accolades, upon the early months when the war began, the women entered the service and would go through rigorous training and when looking at what they had to go through, they were not treated any different from the men.  The women took the big leap forward to prove that they could be as equal in ability and to fly and to serve.  Indeed, this was a shining moment and makes one think, their predecessors received a completely different treatment in World War I.  In spite of differing comparisons, the these women pilots were ambitious with much spunk.  In their brief history, future women flyers began being recruited into the Civilian Pilot Training Program after 1939, they came from different socio-economic backgrounds, some were highly educated and students from prestige colleges others like Ola Mildred Rexroat was a member of the Oglala Lakota Timbers, the only Native American Woman to fly for the military and then there was Hazel Ah Ling from Portland, Oregon, a Chinese-American pilot, and the program was open to all men and women.  It was the springboard and next step into a military career.  Jackie established her Women's Flying Training Detachment and the women would graduate from her program.  It would be by 1943 that the women would be a part of history, pilots Dorothea ""Didi"" Moorman and Dora Doughtery helped to assist Colonel Paul Tibbets and to fly the B-29 ""Ladybird.""""The Women With Silver Wings"" is a story of triumph as well as tragedy but most importantly, the lives of women that never hesitated when opportunities were presented to so-call fly with them at a moments notice.  With the most fascinating stories that intertwine with the women's personal lives and the history of events that occurred during World War II there are also a collection of photographs that captures the period.  An interesting and intriguing history that adds another perspective of the women that contributed to field but also the war effort.",5,0,3856,0.138,1
190,"It’s time to put to rest the tired trope of poor helpless animals in shelters needing the superior benevolence of selfless humans to rescue them.  In Mutual Rescue, Carol Novello definitively and convincingly shifts the dynamic of the conversation from one in which humans are cast as the saviors of animals, to one in which animals give back at least as much—and often more—to the humans aiding them.  That change elevates the cause of animal welfare to one of both animal and human welfare.  And when animals and humans enhance each others’ lives through forging bonds with one another, it is usually the humans who get the best of the deal.Through a series of stories and commentary about the animal-human bond, Novello draws compelling portraits of animals that played central roles in helping their human guardians overcome challenges like grief, depression, addiction, ill health and loss.  In addition to relating these heartwarming and fulfilling stories, Novello takes them a step further by describing the scientific basis for the power of interactions with animals to benefit humans.  When a cat purrs in a human lap, powerful chemicals are released in the human brain that aid in healing both mind and body.  When a dog enters a human exercise routine, motivation and commitment become stronger and more likely to lead to success.  In an era during which scientific explanations are often ignored, the interjection of well-researched facts into the arguments is both refreshing and confidence inspiring.In fact, “inspiring” is the word that comes most naturally to me in thinking about the effect of reading Mutual Rescue.  In the midst of the current ugly public discourse and declining civility between humans, it is especially heartening to partake of upbeat, science-based stories that rekindle our faith in kindness, generosity, and ultimately, the goodness of basic human—and animal—nature.  Because of course, in the end, they are the same thing.",5,0,1965,0.191,1
191,"Earth is dying and the erta were created to save it.  When it is learned that humans will not survive, the erta promise to repair the planet and resurrect humans when the time is right.  Like all erta, our protagonist Ima was bred with a specific purpose—she is a highly focused atmospheric chemist who has spent pretty much all of the last 500 years cleaning up Earth’s atmosphere.Once their individual purposes are fulfilled and the Earth is cured of all human damage, the erta are faced with something that’s never happened before – a disagreement.  Some wish to transcend (a term the author delightfully explains is indescribable in human terms and then goes on to attempt to describe); others want to fulfill their promise to recreate humans first.  To see if humans are worthy of inheriting the repaired Earth, Ima is tasked with engineering a single human child to raise as her own.  The descriptions of this experiment are brilliant.  I used to work with children—infants and older—and the depiction of Ima’s internal monologue concerning the “creature” were spot-on.There is much going on in this book and it covers many years.  I personally could have benefitted from a map, but that lack in no way took away from my enjoyment; I’m just spatially challenged.  There were unexpected turns in the narrative, and flips of characters that I was sure I had figured out.  When I’m not able to figure out the ending a quarter of the way through, it’s a good book.  I enjoyed the surprises, and I was deeply moved by Ima’s transition from a brain-based scientist to a heart-focused nurturer.  The author may have Ima state that she chose her name because in Japanese it means now; but I don’t think it’s an accident that in Hebrew, ima means “mother.”Thank you to NetGalley, Rebellion Publishing, and the author for the opportunity to read an advanced copy of The Human Son in exchange for an honest review.",5,0,1909,0.173,1

This is the second book in the Nightchaser series which is a series that is best read in order since this book picks up shortly after the events of the first installment.  I really enjoyed the first book in the series and was pretty eager to see what Tess and Shade would face in this installment.  I found this book to be enjoyable from beginning to end.One of the things that I really liked about this book is that there was a lot of action from the start.  Tess, Shade, and the rest of the crew seem to always find themselves in dangerous situations and it was fun finding out how they deal with each situation.  There were times that it was almost impossible to set the book aside because I was so caught up in the action of the story.  I thought that the action in this story found the perfect balance with the more romantic and character-focused parts of the book.Tess and Shade are both characters and I think that they really do make a great pair.  They work well together and seem to be able to handle almost any situation.  They are both able to think outside the box and will do what is needed to reach their goals and keep each other safe.  I liked that this story is told from both Tess and Shade's point of view because I feel like we really got to know exactly what each of them was thinking.  It was fun to watch their relationship continue to develop in this installment.I would recommend this book to others.  I thought that this was a really well-done science fiction romance filled with wonderful characters.  This story had a lot of action and more than a few twists and turns to keep things interesting.

Gary Davis), moving to the West Coast and playing with Janis Joplin in the early days among others,  joining Jefferson Airplane and playing at Monterey, Woodstock, and other festivals and venues, to forming Hot Tuna with Casady, teaching at his Fur Peace Ranch music camp while still touring, this book coves Jorma Kaukonen (JK) from before his birth up through the present time.But along the way Kaukonen also lets us into his personal life and it's ups and downs.  He tells of his first marriage  and tumultuous  life with his first wife Margareta (""Neither  of us was mature enough for a real relationship, much less marriage."")  ending in divorce.  His battle with alcohol, his current life and happiness with his second wife and his happiness at having a family, and other personal points--all illuminating a life of a musician who has never really opened up about either his personal  life or  life in music.  JK talks about meeting Joplin, Jerry Garcia and Bob Weir (at the Folk Theater) , Bob Dylan, Paul Kantner  (""...the musical styling I heard in Santa Cruz that day contained the DNA of the Jefferson Airplane"") and a number of other musicians, both well known musicians and others lesser known like Steve Mann (they both took LSD--""Steve and I played for hours"")  and  Tom Hobson (heard on the album ""Quah"") , both who influenced and played with JK, replacing Signe Anderson with relatively unknown singer Sherry Snow (who played with Jeff Blackburn)  and then settling on Grace Slick, and many others unknown to us.Never giving lengthy interviews or known as  a writer, only bits and pieces of Kaukonen's life have previously come to light.  But his relaxed style of writing is almost like sitting down and having a long chat about the many facets of his life.  This easy flowing book also has occasional diary entries and song lyrics to help shape the narrative  and move the story along.  When JK can't clearly recall portions of his life from those days, he calls on people he knows well and trusts to help fill in the blanks--Jack Casady's memories of Grace Slick joining the Airplane--is one instance.  The first  90 or so pages are focused on JK's early life and family, but by the end of Chapter Seven the musical side of Kaukonen's life really begins to take shape.  This is when the book takes on that part of Kaukonen's life that will interest people  who've followed JK's music over the years.  There's an almost ""you are there"" feel to the writing at times which enhances the story with interesting asides and information that keep things exciting for those (like me) who have wondered about Kaukonen's view from his time beginning in the '60s and into the present time.  This is a well rounded look at Kaukonen both personally and musically, with many small details and asides that give his story depth and interest.There's 16 pages of both b&w and color photos (including JK and Joplin on stage in '62, and a full page color photo of JK's full back tattoo), and  his early family life up through the present time with his wife and children.  There's a short Forward from Grace Slick (""If I think I know someone, I ought to think again.""), an Afterword from Jack Casady (""...my oldest and best friend's life story.""), plus an extensive Lyric Appendix, plus an Index.  And there' s a five song CD featuring live tracks--""Been So Long"" ('98), ""Song For The High Mountain"" ('79), ""Broken Highway"" ('86), ""River Of Time"" ('08), ""In My Dreams"" ('16)--which is a nice treat for those who want to hear Kaukonen solo.",4,0,3909,0.155,1
195,"Lily Adler is a widow who has just returned to London to become more involved in the world after the loss of her husband.The first night back in town, at a ball, she is walking in the garden when she hears a conversation between a young man and an older man.  As she is walking away, she hears a shot.  The young man is dead.Lily attempts to provide information to the Bow Street runners, but there is no interest in what a woman has to say.  She is not considered a witness who will be able to provide anything of importance.Lily begins to investigate on her own along with, Jack,  a good friend of her late husband and a young lady, Miss Oswald,  who knew the young man who had been killed.Slowly, the three of them begin to put things together.Lily is very good at puzzles.  Jack is able to physically look into things.  Ms Oswald is intelligent and able to see things from a new perspective.They make a good team.The mystery is interesting and the historical setting is well defined.I did feel that Lily was not always a character I liked very much.  Her anger became very frequent.  She seemed to have tunnel vision at times.  Investigating with tunnel vision is good.  Tunnel vision in relationships is not quite so good.The reader gets to know each character quite well.  As the investigation progresses, it is clear who each possible suspect is as well as their possible motives.I felt there were times when things were slow moving.  But, because this is first in a series, the extra details were probably there to allow the reader to understand the scene.Ms Schellman is a talented author who has created this first story in a mystery series.  I have no doubt that the series will be quite successful.I received this book from the publisher through NetGalley.

196,"I purchased this book in desperation, fresh off loss of a loved one without giving it proper consideration.  Had I done my due diligence, I could have saved myself a little money and a lot of annoyance - not to mention, precious time which I will never get back.  (Although, I do credit myself for at least being smart enough not to go beyond the first 100 pages.  So there's a slight savings there)The author has combined two complex and enigmatic areas of research - theoretical physics, and after-death studies - and has proven that she has no understanding of either.  In the case of the first, theoretical physics, it is almost impossible to have a proper grasp without years of formal education and work in the field.  So it is laughable that she should even make the attempt to include this in her book.  In the case of the second, after-death studies, serious research has been on-going since the end of the Nineteenth Century to the present, but it's clear that she has made no attempt find and sift through any of it.  Instead, with her cursory understanding, she has cobbled together her own theory, based on nothing, and even invented her own annoying terminology to go with it,  like ""Temple World"" and ""The Super Watcher"", by which I assume she means the greater reality and the higher self, respectivelyMy advice for anyone who is grieving or just interested in the subject matter, search the internet and media like YouTube where you can educate yourself for free.  Over time you will develop a feel for what rings true for you, which will certainly be more useful than anything you can find in this book.  An excellent place to start is with near-death experiencers and frequent, well-honed Astral travellers, like Jurgen Ziewe and Cyrus Kirkpatrick (Afterlife Topics and Metaphysics)But whatever you do, learn from my foolhardiness and save yourself from diving into this shallow pool of fabricated drivel",1,0,1923,0.172,1
197,"Brought to you by OBS Reviewer DanieleReaders are drawn into Gino Donatelli’s world in Italian Harlem when his sister-in-law seeks his and Frank’s help in finding a settlement volunteer whom they think has been kidnapped by the Black Hand.  Gino finds himself in the wrong place at the wrong time when the police discover him standing over the body of an Italian Harlem crime boss.  As far as the police are concerned they have caught their killer, and Frank, Sarah, Maeve, and Gino do all they can to clear Gino’s name and break up the extortion ring.I always enjoy my time with Frank and Sarah Malloy, but I really like this book’s greater emphasis on Gino and Maeve.  It is so fun to get to know some of Gino’s family, and they provide comic relief to balance the heavy subjects of murder and women and children being kidnapped.  Sarah is ahead of her time, but it seems appropriate for her character, and I appreciate Thompson’s acknowledgement of her unique position through the actions and attitudes of some of the other female characters.  Gino and Maeve’s teasing and simmering relationship have been going on for quite a while now, and fans of the series should be pleased with them here.The mystery is pretty straight forward and easy for readers to figure out even though it takes the protagonists much longer to get to the bottom of things.  They get in their own way with assumptions, and uncooperative witnesses and suspects slow the investigation down.  That said the pace is steady, and the story is engaging throughout.  I can always count on Thompson to provide accurate historical tidbits without being tedious.  I knew nothing of Italian Harlem, the volunteer programs to help immigrants, or the Black Hand before reading about them here.  Interesting stuff.Murder on Pleasant Avenue is a nice contribution to the long running Gaslight Mystery series sure to please series devotees and new readers alike.",4,0,1924,0.191,0
198,"I received a copy of this title from the publisher for an honest review.  The Body in the Garden is the first in a new Regency mystery series featuring Lily Adler, a recent widow returning to London after her mourning period has ended.  Lily is trying to figure out what she is going to do with the rest of her life after her husband died unexpectedly leaving her widowed in her mid-20s; the life they planned around his political career is over and she is at lose ends.  Upon arriving at the town house she rented for the Season, her friend Lady Serena Walter appears and insists Lily must begin to move about in Society and that Serena's ball that night is the perfect opportunity.  Captain Hartley, Jack, her husband's childhood friend arrives unexpectedly at her new home, and Lily agrees to allow him to escort her.Finding re-entering society to be even more difficult than she expected at the ball, Lily finds herself alone in the garden and over hears an argument.  Before she can re-enter the house, there is a gunshot and a dead body.  Jack comes to her aid and helps her enter the house and alert Serena and her husband to the death.  When the authorities drop the investigation into the death, Lily, Jack, and Lily's new acquaintance Miss Ofelia Oswald team up to undercover not only who the body is, but why he was killed and by who.Jack, Lily, and Ofelia are very engaging characters that I wanted to keep learning more about throughout the story.  The mystery is well done with enough twists and turns to keep the reader guessing about who the killer is and why it happened.  There is beginnings of a romance between Jack and Lily that I look forward to watching develop in future books.  Overall, this is a very good first entry into what is a very promising new series.  I will be on the lookout for future books in this series.",4,0,1844,0.097,0
199,"*This book was received as part of the Amazon Vine program.Anonymous is a Woman.  For most of history, women have been sheltered, ignored, or forced to hide their brilliance as to be recognized or accepted in society.  The title of this book reflects that, with the concept that a lot of works that were done anonymously, were probably by women so they could get their art/writing/whatever out into the world.The book starts with several chapters that helps set the tone and numbers for the gender inequality that permeates countries around the world.  From there, it launches into brief descriptions of fifty women who made huge impacts on the world, but whom you've probably never heard of.  Each is accompanied by a beautiful illustration.These are small summaries, so don't expect to get in-depth histories of any of these women.  More often than not it details who they were, when and where they were born, what they accomplished, and in most the cases, how that accomplishment was hidden or stolen.  Which is slightly depressing but at least uplifting in that these women are getting the credit now.  The book contains a lot of information though and I wished that it had gone more in-depth with the information on these women, although I recognize in some cases that's not even possible due to lack of available information out there.  One note about this book (and I was reading an ARC so this could change) is that the physical book is large and unwieldy making it better suited as a coffee-table book (especially with the illustrations) than as a book you sit down to read in an entire-sitting.  Which, with the subject matter, I sat and read in an entire sitting because I found it engaging.You'll learn about women you've never heard of before, and get to appreciate some truly beautiful illustrations.  This is a nice beginner-type book on notable women in history.Review by M. Reynard 2020",4,0,1903,0.123,0
200,"I absolutely loved ""Jar of Hearts"" and was thrilled to have the chance to read the ARC of ""Little Secrets"".  Once again Jennifer Hillier pulled me right in with her writing and a story that is dark from the start.Marin and Derek have been together since college.  They are both incredibly successful and in love with their 4-year old son, Sebastian.  But their lives are about to take a tragic turn.A few days before Christmas, Marin and Sebastian are at the bustling Pike Place Market in Seattle where Derek is coming to meet them.  Marin answers a call on cell phone...she lets go of Sebastian's hand for just a few seconds...and then he's gone.  It's as if he disappeared into thin air.More than a year later Marin is a shell of her former self.  The FBI never found Sebastian.  Marin has never forgiven herself.  She and Derek barely speak.  And she's barely keeping it together.""And that's what life is these days, isn't it?  A series of slips and catches, mistakes and remorse, a constant juggling act of pretending to feel okay when all she wants to do it fall apart.""Desperate for answers Marin enlists the help of a P.I., but she uncovers a new secret Marin wasn't even looking to find - her husband is having an affair.  Despite the problems in her marriage, Marin has already lost her son and she will stop at nothing to make sure she doesn't lose her husband too.This was a fast read with short chapters that left me wanting to flip *one more page* that of course never stopped at one more.  We get multiple perspectives, which I always love, and a twisted tale of dark and messed up people doing dark and messed up things.  I love flawed characters that I am simultaneously hating yet somehow rooting for.  Thoroughly enjoyed this read!Big thanks to Jennifer Hillier, NetGalley Minotaur Books and St, Martin's Publishing Group for the opportunity to read the ARC of this book.",4,0,1889,0.147,1
201,"Thomas Holgate’s debut novel is not pretty.  All sorts of depravity is uncovered, not the least of which is found in his hero, detective Paul Czarcik, a boozer and drug abuser, who is focused on stopping a serial killer’s deadly campaign against those who harm children.  One would think that the torture and slaughter of other humans who commit terrible abuses against the helpless might be justified, but the detective begs to differ.  He is dedicated to putting a stop to the killings.  If you don’t care for gore you might want to look at another book.The wife of the depraved man who turns out to be somewhat untrustworthy, a quality he discovers even as he beds her in joyous adultery, assists him in his quest.  As the mad killer, a renowned and brilliant researcher with an inoperable brain tumor weaves his way through his victims, Czarcik seems always a step behind and the victims start stacking up with no relief in sight.  Daniel Langdon, the crazed murderer, believes himself to be morally justified in his revenge because of the depravity of his victims and the detective is blinded by his sense of justice while seemingly inept in his desperate chase.The reader is caught up in this game and the author does some good things in his novel.  First, he keeps the character list small.  There are not a lot of characters which keeps the storyline fairly straightforward.  There’s not a lot of confusion created by trying to keep the characters aligned with his plot.  The dialogue is well constructed, clear and concise, a trait not always followed by some current authors.  This makes the reading more enjoyable, in my opinion, and a trait worthy of applause.  Thank you, Thomas Holgate, for giving me a book I didn’t have to stumble over to enjoy.I recommend this book and look forward to future writing from the author.Schuyler T WallaceAuthor of TIN LIZARD TALES",5,0,1878,0.196,1
202,"In the introduction to his latest book, 97 year old Harvard emeritus Professor, Bernard Bailyn, shares his educational route to becoming one of the the world's foremost early American historians.  He cautions the reader that the pursuit of history can be tricky because the historian must not be influenced by current events or past trends.  In terms of historical documents, the lucky historian occasionally ""stumbles upon them in odd corners and in the interstices of standard discourse.""  Two examples from the five chapters in Bailyn's work underscore this point.  In the first chapter, Bailyn happened upon the hand-written 37 page will of a 58 year old Puritan merchant.  The will reveals the merchant's pride at his successes which in turn come into conflict with some of his neighbors and the strictures of the Puritan faith.  He literally pours out these personal conflicts within the document.Similarly, in chapter 3, Bailyn is seeking the source of revolutionary thought in the colonies.  Rather than the fiery patriotic speeches from pulpits and soap boxes, Bailyn accesses 3,280 pages of newspaper articles which were published from 1765-1771 and were collected, annotated and indexed by a contemporary Boston resident.  His annotations especially underscore the level of revolutionary fervor of the time.At the end of the book, the author includes an epilogue of his personal ""sense of history, its character as an elusive form of knowledge, its possibilities and limitations...""  For this reviewer, this section was less tightly written and at times difficult to follow.  It might have benefitted from some editing.  Also at the end, in the appendix, are the memorial minutes, Bailyn read at Harvard in memory of his two main teachers and mentors there, Samuel Elliot Morrison and Oscar Handlin.  His regard for these scholars is evident as is their influence on Bailyn's evolution as a first class historian.",4,0,1924,0.052,0

Antonia acknowledges that when someone you love dies, part of you dies with them but they return, bringing you back with them.  She asks herself, is that was the afterlife is: “an eternity of rememberings?  Over to you, Sam.  She talks to him in her head.”  It pains her that Sam exists in the afterlife, romping around in her head, but Antonia will not have Sam to keep her alive in his imagination.Because she is bilingual she does translating for Spanish speakers in their small Vermont hospital.

205,"It's been a horrible summer so far, coming after an equally horrible spring.  I'm in Queens, NY, where everything COVID hit first, and the sound of ambulances racing by was constant.  We may be relatively quiet now, but much of the rest of the nation is going through what we did.  One of my daughters has recovered from the virus, but has lost friends.So when a new Paul Levine book came out, it's an even greater thrill than usual!  A few hours off from thinking about our current situation is a mini-vacation.Having read all the Jake Lassiter books, it was also like visiting a family of friends who are really wonderful people.I thought the plot, Jake Lassiter's nephew Kip using his great brain for evil, not good, taking the SAT's and being part of a company that helps get students into college for a pretty hefty fee, was pretty much up to the minute with the recent scandals.And then, it was discovered Donald Trump had someone take the SAT's for him.  My children attended a school that Donald Trump was kicked out of, and the head of the school cringed every time someone even mentioned his name, and that was 20 years. ago.So, in literature as in life, cheating is real.The ongoing situation of Jake's brain damage from football is always fascinating, and the courtroom scenes after Kip is arrested and thrown under the bus by the man he worked for are absolutely great.  Drama, tension, humor, logic and justice, reading about Jake, despite his handicaps, including migraines and clanging in his head, there isn't a better lawyer in fiction, and from what I've seen, real life.  ""Legal Thriller"" is the perfect description  There's some pretty exciting medical stuff in there, too.As is usual for the series, and all of Paul Levine's other books, the book is beautifully written, exciting to read, and I lost almost a whole night's sleep.

206,"Even if you’re not an avid gardener, there is a lot to like about this book: flawed characters finding redemption, drama with uplifting results, and a lush, magical backdrop.  Iris is an elderly shut-in who has literally walled herself off from the outside world by building a giant fence around her house.  Having lost her husband during WWII and her daughter not long after, she finds it is easier to avoid anything that might break her heart further.  Instead, she hides away with the only thing that makes her happy and that is her incredible garden.  In her former life she was a botanist, so she knows her stuff, and the garden she’s cultivated for the past decades is the thing of dreams.Iris also owns the house next door which used to belong to her grandmother.  When a young family moves in as tenants, the expectations are that they will have no contact whatsoever with their landlady.  Abby, her husband Cory, and their daughter Lily have their troubles too.  Cory is struggling with PTSD having returned from the war in Iraq and Abby can’t seem to get him to open up.  He drinks too much, loses his temper, and can barely function.It's when these two unlikely neighbors finally connect that the healing begins on both sides of Iris’s fence.  Every segment of the book is themed after a different flower in Iris’s garden and as the summer of 2003 progresses, there is more to discover in this inspiring story.  One flaw, though, was that Shipman confuses her technology a bit, referencing smart phones and other things that didn’t exist yet in 2003.  Also, as much as I liked Iris’s character development, she had a lot of wisdom to share with Cory, but seldom took her own advice, which was a little frustrating.Otherwise, this is a near-perfect feel-good summer book.  I love gardening and I felt I learned so much about a wide variety of the flowers featured.",4,0,1874,0.065,0
207,"...but who or what will finish it?  ""He Started It"", by Samantha Downing is an absolutely rip-roaring, fascinating, delightfully horrible tale of a road trip down memory lane.  At the behest and bequest of their late grandfather, Beth Morgan and her siblings (along with two of their spouses) undertake the repeat of a cross-country road trip that they had taken with their grandfather twenty years earlier.  It is a journey that will end with the three of them spreading his ashes where their last trip  had ended.  When they complete that, the three of them will inherit their grandfather's not-insignificant fortune.There's nothing like reading about true dysfunction, and these three take the cake.  The short chapters ensure a near-compulsion to keep reading, because we all know that twists and turns in a plot can keep you hooked, and man, let me tell you, the plot convolutions, twists, revelations, knots, and 180 degree turns kept me flipping the Kindle pages at an unhealthy, carpal-tunnel-inducing rate.Where do all of these twists go?  You need to get on this metaphorical ride with our spectacularly uncharming narrator and her equally suspicious family and follow their diabolical road trip, complete with visits to the country's weirdest museums and collections of bizarre curios.  Alternating with sections from the family's previous trip twenty years in the past and a travel journal is Beth's present narrative.So:  What exactly are the siblings doing?  I can't even begin to tell you, since there are so many strands of this story that interweave in the narrative.  Any one thing could be a spoiler.  Rest assured:  this is a FANTASTIC novel to read and enjoy.  Will you love the characters?  No.  Are you rooting for them?  No.  But you will root for the writing, the narrative, and the tense, forward-moving plot, that drives the readers inexorably toward a sudden, unexpected, horrifying conclusion.",4,0,1922,0.06,0
208,"I am reviewing this cook book after preparing three recipes and leafing through the book as a whole.  As other Vine reviewers have noted, the book that we are reviewing has black and white photos.  Hopefully the final book will be in color.  I  personally felt that the recipes were a little hard to read quickly.  I'm a fan of:  step 1. then step 2. etc.  The recipes I worked with put many directions in paragraph form, necessitating my having to read the same paragraph over and over to make sure I didn't miss anything.That said, two of the recipes I made were as good as anything you will find in a quality restaurant.First was Spaghetti with Sausage, which turned out perfectly and since that was the first time I had tried pasta in my cooker, it was a real Wow! moment.  Excellent flavors.Next I tried the Chicken and Chickpea soup with Orzo, and that was also a delightful food experience!  This recipe also provides instructions on how to use the Instant Pot as a slow cooker, which is reflected in the title of the book (fast and slow).For those two recipes I had to make a grocery list to get the exact items called for.  Since I live in the country and don't have quick access to grocery stores, but do have full freezers, I tried one more recipe, using what I had on hand.  Now, before the chefs who created these thoughtful recipes pull their hair out, I want to be clear that this was an experiment to see how an approximation would work.  And it worked fine.  Not the delicate flavors they were striving for, but very good none the less.  I had some pork and used the Coriander Braised Pork with Oregano recipe.  Didn't make the gravy because the juice was delicious as is and served it over simply prepared potatoes as they suggested.I look forward to trying the Persian Beef next!",5,1,1798,0.135,1

Before I go any further, I want to report that though there are a few sad moments, I wouldn’t consider this a sad dog book (and this is coming from the woman who stops Marley and Me at least 20 minutes early).  It’s a thought-provoking, enthralling memoir.Good Boy chronicles Boylan’s life from boyhood, through transition, and into womanhood via the love of seven different dogs she had throughout her life.  Throughout the book, we see the roles that each of Boylan’s dogs has played in the different stages of her lives, through how they came to meet, to training, and then life with the dog as Boylan’s life continued.I loved this book.  It was by no means a fast read, but Boylan is a fantastic storyteller.  She makes it easy to visualize the different times in her life, along with the interactions between the people in her lives, along with the dogs and how their personalities are so different.  It gave me a new view on love and appreciation, especially as it relates to the pets in my life.Boylan’s writing makes you think about what lessons your pets may be teaching you.  I’ve had Bruce (not pictured here, but the bestest boy there ever was) for 6 years.  He’s been with me through several job transitions, two major moves (about to be three), pregnancy, and all of parenthood thus far.  He’s taught me the power of unconditional love.  It doesn’t matter the day I had, the mood I’m in, or how tired I am, Bruce will be there.  He’s always ready to snuggle or just sit at my feet, whatever I need in the moment.Noodles (pictured), however, I’m not sure what he’s going to teach me yet.  He’s a doofus, but is the most loving and humble dog.  He’s just so happy, no matter what.  We sure do love him.",4,0,1806,0.17,0

Jen's books are always rereads for me, meaning I need to read them multiple times because there are just so many good nuggets in them.  I grew up in a moderately Christian home, maybe.  We went to church every Sunday and I went to a Christian school 3rd grade-12th.  I was pretty active in my church growing up, you know on the church board in high school, regular stuff.  In college I was active in christian groups and went to church most Sundays.  But, I was told by multiple, better christians that my United Methodist Church wasn't good enough because it wasn't strict.  I was told by better christians that going to the sunday evening young adult church, bible study, and a weekly praise/workship session wasn't actually going to church.  So, once I had a full-time job, I stopped.  I stopped doing things like go to church because I didn't want to get up another morning because I should or was supposed to.  In the last 20 years we've gone as a family on Christmas, had our kids baptized, and were married in a church, but going to church is not part of our weekly routine.  Guess what.  Our kids have faith, they believe that God sent his son to die on the cross, so that they can go to heaven.  They know about Noah, they believe that God created the heavens and the earth, even if they might also describe it like the big bang, because maybe that's how he created it, we don't know how he did, we just know that he did.

For the last 16 years my body has been plagued with sickness and disease.  I have battled breast cancer, a carcinoid tumor, chemo brain, chemo induced neuropathy, low immunity, acid reflux, gastroparesis, kidney stones, allergies, sinus and respiratory infections multiple times a year, joint pain, migraines, exhaustion and depression.  I have been on meds for all the above and that in turn adds more negative side effects to my daily woes.  I was tired of being sick and tired.  Fortunately, I stumbled upon The Alkaline Reset Cleanse and the fog, sickness, pain and exhaustion are fading into the past.First, let me say it wasn't easy at first to make this change.  After 49 years of eating refined sugars (chocolate was my primary food group), processed food, non organic, gmos, and not drinking enough water my body was addicted to the wrong foods\additives.  It didn't help that those around me were eating the same way and eating processed food is actually encouraged because it saves time and is so often labeled as good for us.  My body kept showing me I was living a lie, it wasn't healthy, it was breaking me down.  Life wasn't meant to be this way, this way of life is man made and it's destroying our bodies.  I decided I had to give the 21 days and try the Alkaline Reset Cleanse, truly, what did I have to lose?  The week before the cleanse process was easy, just a few changes to my regular way of living, no sugar, caffeine and adding more water, ginger, and turmeric along with a few recipes provided in The Alkaline Cleanse book to get me prepped for the cleanse week.  The first 2 days of the actual cleanse week were a struggle for me, I disliked the consistency of the smoothies, the flavor of kale yuck, and no meat..... I persevered, it was just a week out of my life.  I found I could better tolerate the smoothies that contained the coconut oil and a whole avocado while adding more filtered water and blending longer so the smoothie wasn't so lumpy.  By day 3 of the Alkaline Reset Cleanse I was on board and the weight started to dissolve away.  By day 5 my energy began to pick up.  By day 7 I had lost 10 lbs. just during the cleanse week (I had lost 3 or 4 lbs during the before week.).  Ross had mentioned that the benefits would grow even more after the cleanse week and it did for me.  I'm 4 weeks out of the cleanse and my addiction to chocolate and sugar is gone, I no longer crave it, instead I crave veggies (Never thought I'd say that!).  I no longer have to take meds for my neuropathy, it's gone.  My gastroparesis, no longer a problem.  My energy level is higher than It has been in a few years.  The 13 lbs I lost hasn't come back.  I'm actually getting ready to start a 2nd cleanse to help heal my kidneys.  I'm now beginning to live the life I was meant to live.Are you sick and tired of being sick and tired?  The Alkaline Reset Cleanse book is easy to understand and all the info you need is there, right at your finger tips.  What equipment do you need to start, a decent blender and juicer, water filter jug, measuring cups and spoons, and knives, they don't have to be expensive ones.  Then of course you'll need to purchase the food (Organic is best, but if it's a financial strain non organic will work.), spices, and a few supplements to get started.  Ross covers all of this in his book.What's stopping you?  You and I were meant for so much more!!",5,0,3543,0.029,1
212,"I began this book with no knowledge about what it was like to be a woman in South Korea.  I know that here in America (especially if you watch any of the Real Housewives shows) there is an emphasis on being thin and not aging.  I had no idea that other countries were as obsessed with beauty as us, even more so.This is the story of a group of women, all living in the same apartment building.  Kyuri works at a room salon, where she drinks and entertains businessmen.  Miho, who is an artist, is her roommate.Then there is Ara who is mute and who is obsessed with a boy band and her roommate Sujin who has major plastic surgery in the hopes of being beautiful enough to work in a room salon.Finally, Wonna, a newly married woman who watches the other girls comings and goings with envy as she tries to become pregnant.What was most fascinating and heart breaking besides the room salons where women basically cater to the every need of wealthy businessmen is the obsession with plastic surgery.  Eye surgery and jaw surgery involving shaving the bone to make the shape of the jaw more attractive.  It’s even more  disturbing that these are done on young girls, girls who think they aren’t attractive unless they change the way they look.The book alternates it’s point of view through Kyuri, Ara, Miho and Wonna.It was a fascinating if disturbing read.  The ending came as a complete surprise - not that something drastic happened, more that nothing happened.  It just ended.  One page I was reading the story and the next was the acknowledgment.  I kept flipping back and forth, thinking I had missed something.  In that sense, this is a very character driven novel.  You are there to read about the characters and their lives, not necessarily following a beginning, middle or end that is plot driven.I received an ARC of this book from Netgalley.",5,0,1848,0.108,0
213,"Alia Volz always knew she wasn’t supposed to talk to anyone about her family’s business.  As a small child, she wasn’t sure why because all of her family’s friends and acquaintances seemed to either be involved in the business or eager customers, but she knew not to talk about them to outsiders.  Fortunately, in those roaring days in San Francisco, few of the people she would encounter were outsiders.This book succeeds on many levels.  It’s a touching story of a child who grew up among the original hippies in a family where she never doubted she was loved and indulged.  It’s the story of a mother who came up with what was then a very nontraditional recipe and distribution network for magic brownies that would support them all.  Her father wrestled with physical illness, mental illness, and defining his sexuality but always tried to make his family his priority (not always successfully).  It’s San Francisco during a time when it seemed that everyone was discovering marijuana and anyone could go to prison for using it.  And it’s the story of a whole generation of young men and women discovering ways to celebrate their own definition of sexual orientation and the outbreak of a deadly disease that seemed to prey only on them and from which only Alia’s mother’s Sticky Fingers brownies offered relief.This is a lengthy book and there were times I found myself wondering where the story was going, but it was always entertaining and did, in its own time, arrive at a destination.  When I thought afterward about what I might have edited out to make it shorter, I couldn’t think of a single thing that wasn’t needed to tell the story right.  The book is nicely illustrated with photographs and each chapter is marked with a picture of one of the Sticky Fingers brownie bags, which became a collectible in their own right.",4,0,1834,0.11,1
214,"This is one of those thrillers that have so much suspense within the pages that it is hard (almost impossible) to put down.  The scenario at first is an all too common one.  Marin is Christmas shopping with her pre-school son Sebastian when within a few minutes, he disappears.  The video shows that he walked away with Santa.  What?!?  Sixteen months later, the story continues.  Marin and her husband Derek are barely acknowledging each other and Marin is in therapy.  From being a successful upscale hair salon owner to being a total nervous wreck, that is Marin’s life.  She went from having a seemingly perfect life to one where the bottom fell out, especially when she discovered that  Derek was having an affair with a barista named McKenzie.  The clues in the book point to Derek and McKenzie having something to do with “Bash’s” disappearance, but this is where the twists and turns begin and don’t stop until the ending.  I enjoyed the excellent and well-written book, but I did not like any of the characters.  Marin was supposed to be the most sympathetic character, but she was also too flawed for me and had some one-dimensional characteristics that were unexpected in a mom who had lost her only child.  Derek was manipulative and conniving, as was his paramour McKenzie.  Neither struck a chord with me and I spent my time reading the book, hoping that they got what was coming to them.

215,"As a healthcare worker during the COVID pandemic, I was feeling about as depressed as possible without being officially clinically diagnosed.  This book was exactly what I needed as I sat in the hospital call room feeling completely helpless and alone in the middle of this COVID pandemic.  I was beginning to lose faith in humanity as I saw groups of teens out on the beach instead of heeding the stay at home orders.  I was feeling like my life didn't matter anymore as I saw so many people passing away in the blink of an eye.  I turned to reading to escape from the horrible reality of life and this book not only pulled me out of my own darkness, but gave me the feeling that I could change the entire world.  ME.  A single individual.  I suddenly had the power to change the entire world by little acts of kindness.  The different chapters give little anecdotes about how lives are changed starting with the smallest act of kindness.  Each chapter ends with suggestions of things to try to make the reader's life a little happier.  There is even an entire appendix dedicated to naming several organizations to reach out to if feeling compelled to start contributing to society immediately.  If you ever felt insignificant or that you don't matter in the world, this book will change those thoughts and emotions faster than you had them in the first place.  This is a very quick read and will help pull you out of the darkest of places - your own mind - even in the middle of a global pandemic.  YOU matter.  YOU can make a difference.  YOU can choose to take the road to self-fulfillment and it starts with this book.As a quote from the book ""Life is a series of single days.

216,"This is a more or less successful book depending upon the reader's wishes and expectations.  The title and subtitle (and jacket art) suggest that this will be a book concerning the gunfight and its aftermath.  It really is not.  The problem is clear.  We have a nearly 400 pp. book putatively focused on an event which occupied 30 seconds.  Hence, it is very difficult to construct a traditional, three-act narrative which will offer the rhythms of a great novel.  Instead, what we receive is history.  Now history is wonderful and the historiography here is solid, but instead of a structured narrative we get contextual social and economic history—how the city of Tombstone came to be, how the mines operated and the wealth they contained, how the city grew, what was the city's demography like (overwhelmingly male), how the ranchers survived, how the buoyant business of cattle rustling was conducted, and so on.This is all very interesting and all, in general, well executed.  If you are primarily interested in the town of Tombstone and its most salient historical/legendary event, you will love the book.  If, on the other hand, you have loved the movies about Tombstone, the Earps, Doc Holliday and the gunfight (and come here for further elucidation), you will be disappointed.  The gunfight does not happen until around p. 260, i.e. ca. 70% into the book.If you want to learn about what happened and you want to separate fact from fiction and history from legend (without giving up a still fascinating story) you should read Casey Tefertiller's WYATT EARP: THE LIFE BEHIND THE LEGEND.Hence my difficulty in evaluating the book.  As history—4-5 stars; as a book about a legend that is central to our cultural history, 2-3 stars.  I settle on 3.5, rounding to 4, but potential readers should be cognizant of what awaits them here.",4,0,1838,0.204,1
217,"As I organize my thoughts about ""The Wedge,"" I get a tiny sense of the vast size of Scott Carney's project in this new guide to human potential.  I am starting to do breath work, but I have mostly been too engrossed min the many stories and scientific concepts here to take serious time to use it for my own benefit, and I hope that writing a review will help me begin that serious work.This book touches my heart and mind with visionary answers to questions  that have long lingered around the edges of my mind, from ideas like ""using your peripheral vision activates your parasympathetic nervous system"" to how the role of carbon dioxide in the body can make you want to breathe better, because you now understand so much about how your nervous system works.Every chapter is organized around a story of how Scott found the information which backgrounds each new piece of the resiliency strategies that make up the Wedge, and help him to define this new term in fascinating ways.  Along the way, I began to see and share the excitement of Scott's role, now growing beyond the anthropologist/investigative reporter/adventurer labels he has used.  The areas he researches are so specific that he is always an outsider to the science, but he is wielding his status with great finesse; he can now connect many branches of human experience, and you see his confidence growing as he understands his understanding of the Wedge.This is a fascinating read, even though it is full of densely powerful information.  It inspires so much hope of being a more resilient, more able-to-enjoy-life person.  If you have read his previous works, be prepared for how far it ventures into new territory, with a shift in scope.  I trust that many others will love and utilize this book as much as I intend to.

Gray’s mom just died of cancer, her sister got married to a religious fanatic and her husband has left her for his executive assistant, a young woman that Gray actually hired.  Thus, Gray is feeling alone and abandoned by happiness.  Diana Harrington has left her boyfriend who is a gambling addict and is working a menial job at a photo shop when Gray comes in for a print job and ends up getting Diana fired.  This begins an unlikely friendship that develops as the story continues.  I fell in love with the author’s ability to weave a good story with good lessons in it.

220,"Rating:  3.5 stars rounded down to 3 starsKarin Tanabe’s “A Hundred Suns” did not quite fulfill my expectations.  Set in 1930’s Indochine (present-day Vietnam) the book introduces us to Jessie and her French husband Victor Michelin Lesage.  They are moving from Paris so that Victor can climb another rung on his family’s business ladder.  American Jessie comes with her own set of secrets that she is trying to run from and bury.  The dissolute ex-pat society that she finds in Indochine exacerbates her fragile mental state.There are rumblings of rebellion fueled in part by Jessie’s new friend Marcelle de Fabry.  Marcelle is part of the ex-pat community, but she also has a local lover and her own reasons to want to overthrow the French regime in Vietnam.  The setting is steamy.  The ex-pat society pinballs from excessive drinking to opium use.  The ex-pats treat the Vietnamese horribly.  I am glad I wasn’t actually plunked down in the middle of this setting.Historical fiction and women’s fiction are this book’s advertised genres.  However, there is also a strong element of a psychological thriller embedded in the story.  Will Jessie crack in this foreign environment?  What secrets might she let slip?  Will they have the power to destroy her and her family?  For me, the book was too muddled.  I appreciated the story arc that the author was trying build.  However, I thought that arc was too broad.  I think I would have enjoyed it more if the focus went deeper on the historical fiction aspect, and less on the psychological thriller aspect.  I did learn new things about Vietnam in the 1930’s, which enhanced the book’s experience for me.‘Thank-You’ to NetGalley; the publisher, St Martin’s Press; and the author, Karin Tanabe, for providing a free e-ARC copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.",3,0,1824,0.128,1
221,"I read this book in a night, mainly because I loved the usage of flowers and the various ways they were weaved within the story.  It was also easy reading and while I wouldn't describe much of the topic matter as ""light"", it was still something that was easy to sink into.  That being said, it did have a few flaws, I wavered between three and four stars for this one.Iris has lost everything, and as such walled herself up to keep even more pain from reaching her.  She just has her garden; her plants that she has put so much of herself into and for which she used to be well known.  Abby moves next door with her family, Cory, back from the war and suffering, and her daughter Lily, who is bright and exuberant.  Abby herself is holding the family together, at a new job where here talents aren't respected in the way that they should be.The book bounces back and forth between times; the current where Abby and her family are living next to Iris and learning about her and themselves.  And the past, where Iris has her history shown and the tragedies she has faced.  While I thought the book had an easy flow, I did think some of the themes could be heavy handed at times.  It's not to say they're not valid topics, but more that the dialogue and actions around them were inauthentic and came across as awkward.  It was really jarring when that happened and lessened my enjoyment of the book.But the flowers; that's where this book shined.  Because each chapter had its own flower dedicated to it and tied into that theme.  I really enjoyed how that was done and even now have a few new flowers to add to my garden because of the book (who knew you could make hollyhock tea).A few flaws but still worth reading.

222,"Regency romances have always been a genre I’ve enjoyed, but I’ve found them to be great escapism reading during our current COVID-19 crisis.  To Have and to Hoax was a delightful novel full of romance, humor, and unforgettable characters.At a party during her debut season, Lady Violet Grey is found alone on a balcony with Lord James Audley.  Lord Audley being an honorable man, proposes to her and they are the great love match of the season.  Five years later, the couple is found to be anything but a happy love match.  They had an argument four years earlier and have lived in a cold silence since then.  What was this argument about and what extremes will Violet go to to capture her husband’s attention again?To Have and to Hoax was very entertaining.  I couldn’t wait to see what scrape Violet and James would get into next to try to outdo each other.  I also loved when they would figure out that they had been had by the other.  It reminded me of a 1930’s screwball comedy in a Regency England setting.  The romance was rather steamy at times and very romantic.  I really loved the overall story of Violet and James coming to terms with the mistakes they had made in the past and figuring out how to make their marriage work in the future.  I also vastly enjoyed the side characters.  I really hope Waters writes another book with these characters as I would love to see what the future has in store for them.Favorite Quotes:“However, bloodshed did have an odd way of spoiling an evening.”“But as I cannot undo the past, I am merely going to do the best I can in the present.”Overall, To Have and to Hoax is a delightful comedy and historical regency romance.Book Source:  Review Copy as part of the Simon & Schuster Blog Tour.

Could she actually be falling for one of the enemies, or is it just part of how deep she is willing to go?In the binge-worthy read of the season, Clique Bait takes readers deep into the halls of Arlington Preparatory and straight inside the popular clique, exposing the dark side of popularity and the sacrifices that it takes to stay on top.  Readers will instantly be caught within Chole Whittaker’s intense, non-wavering determination and the lengths she will go to avenge her best friend.Fast, compelling, and mesmerizing Ann Valett holds her readers in the palm of her hand.

Throughout the book readers will discover themselves asking two great questions- Will Chloe get her revenge, and what really happened to Monica?

224,"Zeppelins and dirigibles (airships) generally remain a popular subject 80 years after they largely disappeared from the skies.  Part of the attraction is visual—the silvery streamlined shape caught the world’s imagination—and part is historical-operational.In this magnificent compilation, the versatile historian Alexander Rose (“Washington’s Spies”) distills the rigid airship story down to two main players: German Hugo Eckener, inheritor of Count Zeppelin’s mantle, and U.S. aviation entrepreneur Juan Trippe of Pan American Airways.  Their long corporate battle for domination of trans-oceanic air travel peaked during the glory days of the 1930s, when long-range airplanes finally overcame the airship’s early lead.  Along the way, Eckener seems to emerge as the more sympathetic character, mainly due to Trippe’s behind the scenes machinations, especially in Latin America.However, there’s far more to Rose’s book than the competing careers and egos of Eckener and Trippe.  The cast includes Charles Lindbergh and Igor Sikorsky, among others, who of course made their own historic contributions to aviation progress and commercial aviation.Many readers will expect detailed accounts of Zeppelin use in World War I, and they will not be disappointed.  In fact, the book begins in the United States in 1863 when German army officer Ferdinand Zeppelin observed the trends in the Civil War.  His exposure to Union Army balloons set him on a world-historic course leading to “giants in the sky.”The Zeppelin story peaks in 1937 when the Hindenburg met “a perfect storm” of  events that spectacularly destroyed the German flagship in New Jersey.  Rose meticulously but clearly details the contributing factors, and the consequences of the disaster.Rose is a tremendous researcher, as evidenced by nearly 80 pages of acknowledgments, sources, and notes.  Dedicated aerophiles may appreciate the notes as much as the literate text as a rare compendium of lighter-than-air references.",5,0,1982,0.1,1

To say that carnage occurred would be an understatement.  Eight years later the families of some of those slain in this massacre have relocated to a county in Los Angeles,  California.  Trying to expand their influence in the region is happening but not as quickly as hoped.  Revenge is also on the mind of the Don of the family as is the expansion of his territory.The reader is introduced to a Marine team ....'the Desert Snakes' led by LT Tom Castle, Platoon Leader.  The members are as unique as they are talented and include SGT Salvatore, CPL 'Chaplain' Bettis, LCPL 'Tooth' McCloud and SGT Zed Menk...  They will illustrate their capabilities as a unit repeatedly as this novel continues.Toss in the American Military Patriots (AMP) for a decided twist on this one.  Recruiting members does indeed sound like propaganda for the government...I read this on my Kindle but the author wrote the Mafia portions so well that I swear I could hear those scenes with the heavily accented actors in 'The Godfather' playing in my ear.  Incredible to me...This novel is well written with excellent descriptions that will have the reader gasping at times and holding their breaths for others.

Evan Hawke is repairing his mom’s house so that he and his brother can sell it.  Addie is renovating her Tito and Tita’a old B&B so that she can establish a future for herself and her small son Sawyer.  With a tight budget and not much know how about fixing things, it is a natural progression for her old boyfriend Evan to offer to help Addie get her place ready for the big grand re-opening.

The difficulty lies in the terrible secret that Addie is keeping hidden from Evan, a problem so soul-wrenching that it may tear the two apart again before they can really get together.  I loved the interaction between Evan and Sawyer and how natural it was.  I also enjoyed Sawyer’s precocious antics as he squirmed his way into Evan’s heart and played with Evan’s dog Belay as if they were best friends.  The whole story was just a feel-good story, with a definite conflict that had to be resolved.  With a theme of forgiveness and redemption, it is the perfect tale to read to offer feelings of hope and joy.  Fans of light romance with a Christian perspective will definitely enjoy this book!DisclaimerDisclosure of Material Connection:  I received a complimentary copy of this book from the publisher via Netgalley.

229,"There are reasons that having a book released during this time of enormous uncertainty and shutdowns in our country (and around the world) could be considered unfortunate.  But for two reasons, I think this book will stand out and succeed.  One, the author Rebecca Stead is a celebrated Newbery winner (When You Reach Me) who has a huge following of fans.  Two, this is the perfect book for young readers to devour hopefully easing some of the anxiety in their minds right now.  Bea is an almost 13-year old girl telling the story of the year when she was 10 that her dad got married (to a man named Jesse) and she gained a sister.  Her mom and dad had amicably gotten a divorce two years previously and she weaves in lots of her worries - small to more significant - and some of the coping strategies her therapist Miriam has taught her.  She is such a likable character and it is heartwarming to see the amount of love and support her family has for her.  I think this book has a cathartic quality to it - it is likely readers will identify with some of her worries and will relate well to her.  I can’t wait to have my 10-year old read it.Side note, when I first read the description of the book, it reminded me of another one I read recently To Night Owl From Dogfish by Holly Goldberg Sloan.  They both deal with daughters of gay dads who were getting married and becoming sisters.  I liked that book too, but I loved this one.  And they are different and each worthy of their own praise.Would be a great read aloud for 4th or 5th graders or book for reading during quarantine.  I believe it would calm an anxious child and chances are we have more of them as a result of this crisis.  Loved.",5,0,1697,0.219,0

231,"This is one of the best YA books I have read in awhile.  To be honest, although I was intrigued by the premise of the book, I wasn't expecting to be so impressed by the sophistication of this book and it was a fantastic read.The story focuses on Jocelyn, a normal teenager just trying to get by, when she receives the unwelcome news that her family's Chinese restaurant is in trouble - and if they can't save it, the family may have to move.  Determined to stay where she is because of her strong friendship with her best friend Priya, Jocelyn embarks on a plan to save the restaurant.  Her family gives her permission to hire Will to help with this plan, and their work relationship quickly develops into something much more as they attempt to raise the profile of the restaurant, bring in more customers, and bring the restaurant into the modern era.  Both teens are struggling with various issues, however, and need to learn how to manage those while building a relationship with each other and saving the restaurant.Although I loved both Will's and Jocelyn's characters, it was really Jocelyn that made this story for me.  She is relatable, understandable, sympathetic, and genuine.  I could definitely relate to her struggles and ways of interpreting actions and events.  Because the point of view alternates between both Jocelyn and Will, we could see how Jocelyn interpreted (or misinterpreted) things and then how Will interpreted (misinterpreted) things, and the author did a great job of showing how different interpretations without understanding what the other person really meant can lead to negative outcomes.Additionally, the writing is great.  Perfectly paced, smooth, and the dialogue is very realistic - as are the scenes.Overall, I definitely recommend this for YA and adult readers alike!",5,0,1808,0.18,0

Kelly’s boss, Michael Corrigan, is hosting an event at the Community Center to raise awareness of the plight veterans face with the hope of encouraging others to use his program as a guideline to recreate the model throughout the country to help veterans and their local communities.

Michael brings in Warden Luis Rodriguez of the California Department of Fish and Wildlife to advise the group to be aware to advise the group to be cautious because the area has been experiencing plant poaching.  While no violence has been reported, the succulent, Dudleya farinose, has become a popular plant as a status symbol of Chinese middle-class families, and a lot of money is involved.

There are many surprises around this trio and the darkness will descend without any of them truly realizing what is happening around themselves and hopefully it won't be too late for the light to prevail.This was a very good atmospheric horror story told with a slow burn and vivid descriptions of scenery and landscapes that gave a eerie and haunting feeling to me.  I had a hard time initially getting into the book due to heavy English phrasing but after 20 percent into reading, I fell in love with the writing and found it absolutely perfect for this storytelling.  I will never feel quite the same when I enter the woods again without wondering what may be really lurking within.

It took me two days before I could pick up another book and for me that's crazy talk.  haha.  I think that Amy Harmon creates such an intense emotional connection to her characters and her story that it all just feels so real and raw.  It's hard to let go of.First, I will say that I wouldn't classify this book as clean.  Please make sure to read my content disclosure if you are a clean reader or if you are worried about the content.I don't think you can write a story set on the Oregon Trail and not expect some gritty and heart wrenching things to be happening.  The May family will steal your heart- the whole lot of them.  Naomi and John are so interesting.  I loved learning about them and I loved feeling so connected to them and their stories.  I was pulled in from chapter one and I honestly could not put this book down.This is the story of sacrifice, love, determination, loss and endurance.  It's not an easy story but it is full and it expands your heart and your mind.One of my favorite quotes from the book:""He suffers when you go"", she says softly.""That's not true.""""It is.  It is the suffering of love.  Every parent feels it.  It is the suffering of being unable to shield or save.

Only Lee a Goldberg could put them all together in a thriller that will also have you laughing as you read.  Ian Ludlow is an author who has saved the President and brought a defector out of China, with each of his adventures tied into his Clint Straker stories.  Suffering from writer’s block, he picks up an article about two tourists in Portugal who died while taking a selfie.  What if they were really murdered?  This sparks an idea for his next book .  With Margo, his research assistant and an agent for the CIA, he sets out for Portugal to research the deaths and discovers a connection to murders back home.In Russia a plan has been set in motion to use illegal immigrants to implicate a Mexican drug lord in smuggling and murders in the US.  The evidence has inconsistencies, but it is forcing the President to take drastic actions.  This diverts attention from Russian plans for expansion.  Using social media and information planted with a prominent newsman, they spread their fake news.  It is up to Ian, who has stumbled on the plot, to stop them.Before finding success as the author of the Clint Straker action series, Ian was a writer for the police series Hollywood and the Vine.  It was a time he was not proud of, but his series is re-visited in Fake Truth.  The dialogue between Hollywood and his part-plant partner is guaranteed to get a laugh, but there are also moments of pure action.  I have been hooked on this series since reading the first book, True Fiction, and look forward to seeing Ian Ludlow in the future.I would like to thank NetGalley and Thomas and Mercer Publishing for providing this book for my review.",4,0,1736,0.098,1
238,"EDIT:  Adding a comment after receiving the final copy of the book.  Tonight I decided to make the Sweet and Sour Meatloaf recipe, and it was great!  Very easy to put together for someone like me who doesn't do a lot of cooking.  I deviated from the recipe in that I did not add pork rinds; otherwise I stayed true to it as written.  One think I would do next time is make extra sauce and warm it up for adding more on the plate.  The sauce topping was delicious!  I liked it so much, I would use it on Chicken as well.****I am looking over the review copy I received, and the recipes look delicious!  Because I am not a Paleo eater by design, I don't have on hand many of the needed ingredients.  However, I do plan to get them the next time I shop so I can road test some of these recipes.  These are also ideal for someone Gluten Free, as the ingredients are naturally GF, and will give some creative options for those of us trying to eat healthier, with an emphasis on whole foods  I like the layout and styling of the book - it is easy to read and follow, with nice flow.  I also appreciate the introductory information - especially the quick lists of staples needed to make these recipes.  As another person commented, a finished picture with each recipe would be nice - sometimes the pictures are what pique the interest most.As a side note, I have eaten at Shelby's table and there is nothing she cooks that isn't fantastic.  She is a great cook and I have no doubt that these recipes are all excellent.  Personally, I can't wait to try them out.

239,"I've been reading SciFi for over 60 years and most of the books have been passable to very good.  First Encounter is my first Jasper Scott book and won't be the last.The characters are realistically human, not cold robots without emotions.  Excellent descriptions of appearance without straying overboard.  The interactions and the tension starts from the beginning due to the dichotomy of who's in command of the huge vessel carrying 1,000 colonists to their, hopefully, new home.His crew is primarily military and the soldiers are ""squared away"" (military term).  Friction between the commander, Capt Clayson and the civilian Ambassador runs throughout the entire novel.  There are some crew members that have paired up, not unexpectedly considering the 68 Earth years to travel to the new home.A decent picture of the vessel is painted, but I would have liked to read more about it.  Especially how the 1,000 colonists in cryo tubes were doing, if and when they had to be removed temporarily or permanently, etc.  The science in this novel was excellent, particularly the Captain's discussion regarding the space-time anomaly and ""faster than light"" (FTL) employment.  I'm starting to see more references to FTL in a lot of very recent SciFi novels.  SciFi will become SciTruth in the near future.The story progresses rapidly with a sufficient number of twists and turns that lead up to a surprising ending.  It left me cold, as I though a sequel is demanded.  LOL  I pressed on past the ending and found the author's info AND a sequel to First Encounter that looks like it will definitely pick up on the last page in this one.  That's not all, either.

After all she gets things right, always and always to the minute detail…but not this time.  She is determined to get an answer and reaches out to what she feels is a larger, more qualified source.  A financial wizard surely can find the discrepancy.  After all it’s a large, wealthy firm headed by one easy-on-the eyes Derek Killion with a killer smile that sets Alice’s historical romance daydreams in motion.In Money Man, Nancy Herkness doesn’t disappoint in a well-written suspense romance narrative far from any humdrum “accountant-speak” story.  This drama delivers on character complexities, intrigue, emotional intensity, and, of course, romance.  Throw in some escalating high-tech crime and a dangerous pursuit and the story taps all buttons of a reader’s interest.Found the plot to have a good balance of suspense, emotion, humor and complexity so one can maintain that needed interest to make for a good read.  And the sub-characters certainly lay a road map for future sequels.On a personal note, am not a big fan of historical romance and this story does contain frequent references—flashbacks and daydreaming--to these types of stories.  The main female character has a fixation with this era and frequently envisions full historically dressed romantic encounters as would have occurred during this era.  As a reader, these references just weren’t for me.  Wasn’t interested in reading about Cinderella and Prince Charming costumes at a ball in this context and it seemed somewhat awkward to the story line.  These references don’t diminish in anyway, just (to this reader) seemed superfluous.  The opinions provided are an honest review to an ARC from NetGalley.LindaR",5,0,1864,0.218,1

James O’Connor, the abstainer of the title, is a 19th century Irish police detective working in Manchester, England, having emigrated from Ireland after nearly destroying himself with alcohol after the death of his wife and child.  The Manchester police think he is just what they need to head up their investigation of the Fenian uprising.  Many of his colleagues see him as just another Irish troublemaker, forcing him to operate almost independently within the department.One of his strengths is his ability to call on a common background to develop a web of Irish informants.  When the English hang three men as Fenian plotters, one of O’Connor’s informants tells him that big trouble is on the horizon, including the arrival of one Stephen Doyle, an infamous hitman being brought over from America for an as-yet unspecified retribution.  Shortly after, the informant is found brutally murdered, and O’Connor is charged with bringing Doyle to justice.The plot and setting are intriguing and historically accurate, but they really serve as backdrop to tell James O’Connor’s story.  Through the course of the book, as he pursues Doyle and is daily more destroyed by the police department’s blatant Irish prejudice, his story is revealed.  Ultimately, O’Connor pursues Doyle to the United States, determined to either bring him to justice or, more likely, kill him outright.  This was the only part of the book that didn’t sit well with me.  Although it was an excellent story well told, the ending seemed somehow incomplete.  Everyone had been dealt with, and it didn’t seem like any kind of setup for a sequel, but it just didn’t quite satisfy.Nevertheless, this is, again, an outstanding, well-written book.

It was interesting and veered off in a direction I was not expecting.  I don’t want to talk too much about it and ruin the surprise for someone else, but I really liked the journey this novel took me on.  It was interesting to think about and very engaging.

246,"I was provided an ARC by the publisher for an honest review.I liked the first chapter.  Painted a crystal clear picture: harried Mom trying to get last minute Christmas shopping done, fussy 6 year-old tired of shopping, self centered Dad watching sports and whining for a taco, the horror of losing your child in a crowd.  However, I sensed what was to come in the authors style of writing; telling us everything instead of showing us what's happening and letting us fill in the blanks.I was right.  This book is 90% descriptive prose, 10% dialogue.  Every little thing each of the characters felt, knew, didn't know, etc was written out like a textbook on how to boil water.  We are told what the character is thinking while a conversation is (supposedly) going on, what they did in the past, what they plan to do in the future. and so on.  Nothing was left to chance.  The reader didn't have to imagine what's going on in the characters minds, it was all spelled out for us.It was a good story idea, good plot, but the author took several side trips that didn't really move things along, just felt like emotional filler.  I confess to reading the first and last line of paragraphs by the time I got halfway through.  I didn't miss out on a thing.  Never had to go back and re-read a passage to see what I'd missed.And the ending.  Hoo boy.  I have never, ever wallowed through that many coincidences in a book before.  And mostly unbelievable coincidences at that.  Unless you assume the heroine is dumber than a box of rocks for not putting two and two together long before.

Using the military and the DC police, they swooped down and arrested members of the coalition by the thousands.  No cause was required—even passersby were swept up—and the arrestees were penned up.  Finally, after years of litigation, the arrests were deemed unlawful and the records burned.Lawrence Roberts was one of the arrestees.  But his personal involvement does not mean the book is a diatribe.  His research is broad and deep, including many interviews, archival records and the famous Nixon tapes.  Those tapes are famous in the Watergate context, but they started well before Watergate and show Nixon’s predilection for paranoia, hatred and prejudice (he could be counted on to blame the Jews for pretty much anything).  Every now and then I’m tempted to view Nixon as a tragic figure, but that’s easily remedied by spending a little time listening to the tapes or reading transcripts.The book can sometimes be tough going, but it’s worth it if you have an interest in political history—which still resonates.",4,0,1766,0.054,0
248,"I had to recycle this book after reading the first couple chapters and being accosted with so much idiocy that that I can only surmise that this is simply a waste disposal ship for people they didn't send on on the other three ""real"" missions in some Darwin-award future that is utopian enough that the populace doesn't want to allow them to kill themselves off around the rest of the populace.I mean....How would any space program put someone in charge that had recurring hallucinations and actually insistent to the program doctors that they were being contacted by aliens in their sleep.  Really?How would any space program simply sent an interstellar colony ship to a location that they had no clue what the destination would hold....  and simply refuse to send probes of any sort unit a single day before arrival?  Really?How would the single best hope for communication with possible aliens revolve around an _assumption_ that their brains are just like those of terrestrial mammals?  Really?How would the captain be so incompetent as to not even know their arrival time?How is it possible that after finding a body with alien life for the first time in history, they don't do any study from orbit, but rather just jump in a shuttle and ""weeee!!! lets head down to tromp around for a bit!"".  huh?Setting aside all the physics problems not even touched upon, my only conclusion is that this ship is full of all the rejects.  They didn't want them on the real missions, and the people of earth didn't want them.  So they just loaded them up with enough escape velocity that it would be a one way trip somewhere, and just pleased to be done with them.  May they'll all be eaten by giant space tarantulas or whatever the author has dreamt up.",1,1,1744,0.039,1
249,"This is a book that most Americans need to read.  Simply it is a great step by step guide on how to reach financial freedom, a point where one doesn't have to earn money from a 9-5 job and have enough money saved and invested or passive income to do what they want.  Time is the most valuable resource in our lives.Anybody can do this.  The steps that are provided can be used by anyone.  Most financial books go over basic savings, spending plans and debt reduction.  This book goes above and beyond that and takes you to the next phase of personal finance and gives you the exact steps to do it.Index investing is possible for most people yet it isn't well understood that any person can create an account online and invest the money right away and that it isn't scary as it may sound.  Investing is not taught in school and the belief is it is hard to do or expensive to do but it isn't.  Grant does a great job explaining how investing works and how it grows wealth.This is the book I wish I read when I was 15 years old, that strange age where you are in high school and know soon you have to decide on a career or a college choice.  A time where you may even have a part-time job.  This is a great introduction to spending, saving, investing and real estate hacking especially for the younger generation.I also highly recommend this book for all ages not just Z-Gen, Millennials, but Gen X and Babyboomers because it has fantastic step by step instructions on how to generate more income via side hustles, real estate and invest in index funds.This is one of my favourite personal finance books.  I will be recommending it years to come.",5,0,1643,0.124,1
250,"Pamela Binnings Ewen paints a picture of Coco Chanel as charming yet ruthless and manipulative as she fights for control of her Chanel No. 5.  With the approach of WWII, her business partner Pierre Wertheimer relocated to America, taking the perfume’s formula with him.  Chanel owned only a small share of the company and her efforts to regain control appeared futile.  After the Germans entered Paris, she used her connections to appeal to Admiral Canaris,  head of the Abwehr.  Pierre was Jewish and the Nuremberg Laws prohibited him from owning any business, but her appeal to Canaris came at a price.  It is one that she was willing to pay if she can also discover the fate of her son, a German POW.Ewen alternates her tale of Chanel’s war years with her earlier years.  She was abandoned by her father as a child, became a mistress  as a young woman and finally found love with Boy Capel.  She believed that love would be forever, but was betrayed when she became pregnant and Boy later married another.  Her design of hats finally opened up a future for her that led to her clothing and fragrances and brought the status and wealth that she would fight for.Chanel was not an easy character to like.  As the people of Paris suffered during the occupation, she was unaffected by the food shortages and could not see what was going on around her.  Life at the Hotel Ritz was comfortable for her and her sense of entitlement was constantly in evidence.  Even so, she was an interesting personality whose name is still prevalent today.  It is well worth spending the time with Coco Chanel.  I would like to thank Blackstone Publishing and NetGalley for providing this book for my review.",4,0,1688,0.13,1
251,"The Greek’s Unknown Bride by Abby Green marks my first time reading her.  I love the world she’s built with vivid descriptions.  She allowed me to teleport myself into the pages.  Apollo Vasilis is an extremely wealthy businessman who came from nothing.  He runs hot and cold.  Oftentimes, he is hard to read.  The one thing that’s certain is his disdain for his new wife, Sasha, who has lost her memory after a car accident that should have killed her.  Apollo agrees to take care of Sasha until her memory returns but plans to divorce her as soon as possible.  Apollo isn't prepared for the attraction he feels for Sasha, especially since he hasn't felt that attraction since the night they met.  The two spend their time tiptoeing around their attraction, but it's too combustible to control.  The result is just what Sasha needs to regain her memory and start to put her life back together again.I was so excited to finally read an amnesia story.  I'm not sure if there is a blueprint for how these stories are supposed to go or not.  All I know is that my curiosity kept me reading The Greek’s Unknown Bride.  It took me a while to start to like these characters.  Apollo was abrasive and Sasha was confusing.  The story felt off, but I guess that was intentional in order to keep the reader just as confused as the characters.  For me, I had an idea of what was happening but things didn't totally click into place until the heroine regained her memory.  I love that there was an epilogue.  While the main story ended with a HEA, the epilogue truly tied up the story.  It showed the complete evolution of the characters.**Received a copy of the book from the author and voluntarily reviewed it.**",4,0,1702,0.131,1
252,"I think the book is useful to a certain extent, I don’t like that the author seems biased in so many points not worthy of a true scholarIf you read it with an open mind thinking the Bible stories could be true, you have to give credit to other ancient stories that have something, or in some cases, a lot in common with the Bible, like Gilgamesh, The Bhagavad Gita, The Mahabharata, The Sumerian tablets, the Egyptian and Sumerian King lists, and so many other archaeological finds around the world that history deems as mythology; the author seems to completely dismiss them arguing that the Torah is the only devine truth.If anything, I think the Torah and the Bible could be a part of a much bigger story that is not as well documented as it is in those holy books; and I can understand that for the Hebrews it might be the only story they believe in because it might have been recorded by their forefathers, but they might not have had access to the other parts of the story in post diluvian times;  Dennis Prager even confirms that hypothesis in the chapter about “world unity” and how it might not have been God’s design for humanity to be united, then, why be so arrogant as to think the Torah is the only truth, and dismiss any other stories about the origins of humanity?Plus, the author cannot hide its pro-American views that are only worthy of a Fox News anchor who doesn’t really knows history, it only makes him look like he lacks objectivity……don’t get me wrong, I liked a lot of this book, I just didnt like some judgmental views of the author in some parts of it, as much as I think he was “spot on” in so many others.",4,2,1635,0.086,1
253,"If I had to encapsulate Good Work in one word, I would say that the underlying theme is not mainly about “work” but about “love”.  As Dave Hataj states, “love is a powerful force”.When I re-read this book, and I most certainly will, I think I will start with Chapter 12 “Business as Love”, then read Chapter 13 “Goodness in Action”, then re-read starting from Chapter 1 “Called to Do Business”.  Whether you are a back-to-front of-the-book reader or a front-to-back reader, you will enjoy Good Work.  As with Scripture, Good Work is built on the Biblical foundations of God’s love and goodness.  The principles are solid, the story is thoughtful, but Good Work is in no way formulaic; it is a compelling, encouraging and liberating message.  Moreover, it gives people permission to feel good about their work, regardless of the field to which they feel drawn or called.Remarkably, in the midst of a beautiful testimonial to the honor of labor, working as unto the Lord, leading with integrity and genuinely caring about the welfare of others, comes a clarion call to businesses, business owners, workers, staffers, laborers - anyone who is interested in social and cultural transformation – to ponder Hataj’s statement: “I can think of no other entity or way to love and serve humanity so powerfully than through business.  I’ll even go so far as to argue that if everyone in business had this view, there would be no need for non-profit organizations, because businesses would be truly seeing to the needs of their communities.”  If the business community (top-down, bottom-up) would adopt Hataj’s way of thinking, I think Hataj may likely initiate a global “Good Work Movement” which could philosophically change why people do business…and ultimately transform lives, communities and cultures.",5,0,1795,0.241,1
254,"Nobody is better at motivating, inspiring, and instilling a sense of power in the individual to accomplish everything they put their mind to doing today than John Maxwell.  His books are read by some of the most influential movers and shakers across every demographic you can think of and for good reason.  The man knows which buttons to push to bring the very best out in anyone willing to listen to what he has to say.In PUT YOUR DREAM TO THE TEST, Maxwell asks you ten pretty blunt questions about your personal dreams and desires that will determine if they're even worth pursuing or not:1.  Is my dream really my dream?2.  Do I clearly see my dream?3.  Am I depending on factors within my control to achieve my dream?4.  Does my dream compel me to follow it?5.  Do I have a strategy to reach my dreams?6.  Have I included the people I need?7.  Am I wiling to pay the price for my dream?8.  Am I moving closer to my dream?9.  Does working toward my dream bring satisfaction?10.  Does my dream benefit others?Dreaming in and of itself is not necessarily a bad thing, Maxwell says, as long as you intentions are focused on the purpose of that dream.  Honestly asking yourself those ten questions which he devotes a chapter each to further explain their greater purpose in the dream equation will help you realize if it's a dream worth fighting for or better left as pie-in-the-sky.I'm personally in the midst of following a dream that I feel 100% passionate about and evaluating my answers to all 10 of these questions myself.

Through his books, Injoy Life Club, Maximum Impact, and special series, John Maxwell has served as a long-distance mentor who has been a huge contributor to my personal, professional, and ministry development.  All of his books are great...but I have a new favorite...Put Your Dream to the Test is a blueprint for dreamers.  This book is a practical guide meant to assist in moving your dreams beyond the stage of conception to reality.  The book asks the reader to put their dream through the grid of ten rigorous questions to see how well thought out a dream is so that can actually be accomplished.Put Your Dream to the Test is filled with great stories and practical steps, both mainstays of Maxwell's works.  I found this book to be ""uncomfortably refreshing.""Uncomfortable, because it reminds me that I must make my dreams happen by actually DOING something--too many of us miss the point of dreaming by waiting for our dreams to fall in our laps; our dreams will only become real when we take enough ownership of them to MAKE them happen!Put Your Dream to the Test is also refreshing because each ""test question"" provides solid practical insights--not just into your dream, but into yourself!  The ""success stories"" of dreamers woven into the chapters really hold your attention and reinforce the questions (my personal favorites were Michael Hyatt from Nelson Books and Kevin Myers from 12Stone Church).Because of the impact that John Maxwell has had on me personally, I tell leaders to read everything he publishes, but if I could only read three of his books, Put Your Dream to the Test would be ranked right next to The 21 Irrefutable Laws of Leadership and Leadership Gold.",5,0,1736,0.123,0
256,"Writer Ian Ludlow is stuck.  Despite his most recent exploits as an off the books CIA agent, he can’t come up with anything worthy of his next book.  So when his CIA partner, Margo French, throws a newspaper at him, he picks a couple of articles at random and they begin to investigate as if Ian’s writer’s imagination was right and there is a connection between them.  The scary thing is, they might have stumbled upon something that way, with tentacles that spread from Russia to the US-Mexico border with the news media in between.  But what exactly have they found?I’ve enjoyed the first two books in this series, but this one was a disappointment.  While we see the various threads involved in this plot early on, the story still moves too slowly for the first half.  Once it does start, we get plenty of action and a great climax.  Since this is a loving spoof of the spy genre, I definitely enjoyed some laughs.  The characters can be a bit thin, but that’s part of the genre.  Unfortunately, so is sex, and there are several sex scenes I really could have done without.  The author stages his story in such a way that very thinly disguises his politics, which really pulled me out of the story.  I pick up fiction to escape politics, not to have one point of view shoved down my throat.  I realize both of the things that bothered me might be selling points to others, but to me, they kept me from fully enjoying the book.  I enjoyed the first two books in this series (and the books should be read in order since this one has some spoilers for previous adventures), so hopefully the series will be back to entertaining for the next in the series.",2,0,1655,0.147,0

No, it wasn’t at the launch party of her first book, but it was twenty-five years ago when she, her husband Frank, and their nephew Grady were living in Appleton, Maine.  The principal where Jessica was a substitute English teacher was murdered, and Jessica helped solve the case.  Jessica usually doesn’t talk about it, and she deflects again, but when she goes to apologize to the student later, she discovers that the woman who interviewed her wasn’t a student at the high school at all.  Who interviewed her?  What is her interest in the case?Going into this book, I was concerned that this book was going to contradict things established in the pilot episode of the TV show, but it does a good job of explaining things so that this doesn’t happen.  We do spend part of the book in the past, and all the transitions are easy to follow.  I found both mysteries, past and present, to be very compelling, and I couldn’t put the book down until I reached the climax.  Unfortunately, the climax is a bit over the top, which has happened in the books I’ve read in the series.  Likewise, I did find that Jessica, Mort, and Seth spent more time sniping at each other than I remembered from most episodes of the show.  On the other hand, Jessica has stopped swearing, which was a welcome return to normalcy for the character.  This book is the fiftieth novel based on the show, and as a result manages to work in a few Easter Eggs that fans will enjoy.  If you are a fan, you’ll enjoy this entry.",4,0,1672,0.151,1

Rogue is book 2 in Ms Grey's First Comes Love series.  Although a second series book there are different characters so it's a fine stand-alone story.  There's only a tad bit of reference to the first book and that explains how the three ladies came together, became friends, and entered in an endeavor together.  I read book 1, The Earl Next Door, in May of 2019, so the reminder was nice for me.  I was able to concentrate on this couple without my mind being diverted.  ,Lady Julia Kitson Fairbright is a young widow with a 4 year old son to worry about and fuss over.  Her father-in-law is a Duke and insist on keeping her under his thumb upon threat of taking away her child.  She's desperate to keep him appeased until she can get away.  She's spunky and not sure of her own strength, it's never been tested.  She has a meet cute moment with Garrett Stockton, that's important to me in my romance stories.  The attraction is so fast and strong that it reminded me of being struck by lightening.  The odds aren't good but it sometimes happens.  Rogue is an interesting study in testing your limits, knowing your self, and finally deciding what you want in life.  Goi.ng after it is the journey.  My con with Rogue is the use of such strange names, some I wasn't sure how to pronounce so I made it up.

261,"Grant from Millennial Money has developed a bit of a reputation in the financial independence, retire early (FIRE) community.  He’s one of the people who has questioned social convention around the relationship with work, the complication of money, and accepting the status quo as your fate.I don’t know Grant personally, but his story, told in Financial Freedom: A Proven Path to All the Money You Will Ever Need, comes across in a personable way.  His advice stems from personal experience, trial and error, and accumulations of large amounts of applicable knowledge.He writes toward the idea of life being about more than money.  Molding your life around a 9-to-5 you don’t enjoy shouldn’t be the only option available to you for reaching financial freedom.If we were to redefine the path to financial independence and challenge conventional wisdom on how to earn, spend, save, and invest not only our money, but our time, we would establish a solid financial foundation from which to live.Grant begins his journey by detailing his undesirable beginnings of being forced to move back in with his parents after a series of unfortunate employment actions.  Living back where he started in his childhood room, his life reached a low point.  He felt as if he had experienced a failure to launch when people of his age are supposed to begin finding their ways in the world.Looking down the barrel of a figurative gun, Grant didn’t know how he would ever manage to save enough money to become financially free, let alone enjoy a comfortable traditional retirement in 40 years.  He did everything he was “supposed” to do and yet life guaranteed him nothing.Seeing the undesirable future which lay before him, he considered his options.  If he wanted to have a different outcome for his life, he wagered he’d have to do something different.  Something unconventional.Grant took a fateful moment of realization and decided to change his life for the better.  He set two lofty goals for himself:  (1) save $1 million and (2) “retire” as quickly as possible.  Much like any Millennial with dreams in the clouds, Grant set himself a formidable challenge.  But, as you’ll read in his book, he worked to make his dreams reality.Grant set out to learn as much as he could about finances and question the accepted wisdom about money, work, and retirement along the way.  He found most advice is incorrect, incomplete, or out-of-date for our generation.  As a result, he redefined his path by making it his mission to dedicate thousands of hours to learn as much as he could about money.Financial Freedom is a cataloging of his strategies to make as much money in as little time as possible.  He lays out his exact framework for going from broke to financially woke, as foreword writer Vicki Robin says.Grant aims to dispel myths amount money, namely that it’s complicated.  He targets his advice in just the opposite way: his included math can be done by grade-schoolers and doesn’t require financial genius to pull off.Laying out a seven step plan, he shows his strategy for reaching your personalized definition of financial freedom. The plan touches on all areas of your financial life and has them sum to something much greater than their individual parts.Most importantly, Financial Freedom is a guide to these seven steps and how to make more money in less time thereby freeing you to pursue the things you love in life.  It offers advice on discarding tired financial advice and actually beginning to live the life you want as taught through his experience.The book offers convention-changing advice on:- Creating profitable side hustles and diversifying your earnings through passive income streams- Saving and investing money- Negotiating a more desirable employment arrangement (be it better hours, flexibility, or pay)- Prioritizing travel and adventuresThinking creatively on ways to make money and not limiting yourself to one narrow sourceThe succinct, stated message of the book:“Once you know how money works and you’ve mastered it, you can let it go and come to it on your own terms.  Instead of a worry, it becomes an opportunity.  Instead of it controlling you, you control it.  You have freedom through money.”Above all, the path to financial freedom depends on how willing you are to commit to reaching it.  Grant states anyone can reach financial independence in ten years or less if you’re willing to make the trade-offs necessary.The point is if your end goal is financial freedom, it will require determination to reach it.  It will require looking at decisions differently and organizing your life around new priorities. It will require sacrifice.Based on Grant’s personal success, it would seem like his step-by-step guide would be a valuable resource to redefining your relationship with money.  I know I plan to read it from cover to cover to pick up any advice or tips I can implement in my life.  After all, the message of my site is about reaching financial independence.If you’re unsure of where to start on your path, Grant’s Financial Freedom: A Proven Path to All the Money You Will Ever Need is a great place to begin.",5,0,5142,0.201,0

263,"The Wedding Dress by Danielle Steel is one of those stories that lingers with you long after you finish it.  Danielle Steel is a wonderful storyteller and I was not disappointed with this novel.  We go from 1928 which is the beginning of our tale and taken down through the generations.  We see how each generation lives and how the wedding dress fits into their story.  Each character goes on a journey and we see how they turn out as well as how their decisions impact the family.  I thought the characters were realistic and relatable.  The authors vivid descriptions brought the scenes alive.  I especially enjoyed reading about the gorgeous wedding dress.  It all begins when Eleanor Deveraux meets Alex Allen at her coming out ball in San Francisco.  After they become engaged, Eleanor and her mother travel to Paris to commission her couture wedding dress.  Unfortunately, the stock market crashes in October of 1929 while they are on their honeymoon.  They must weather the changes and find a way to move forward.  The special wedding dress, though, is kept protected so it will be available for the next generation.  This special gown represents love and hope.  Alex and Eleanor face different challenges in their life as do their descendants.  We get to join them on their journey to see how they handle life’s tribulations.  I found The Wedding Dress to be a touching story.  I was transported into the book and reluctantly left when the story ended.  The Wedding Dress is a wonderful escapist novel which is what we need during these uncertain times.*I voluntarily read an advanced copy of this book.  I am not required to leave a review.

I think that even after reading so many in this subgenre there are still some great stories to tell, but they have to be special and stand out in some way.  This one truly does!  It's very well written and the characters are so complex.  It's funny that the description compared it to The Lost Girls of Paris because I actually just finished that one and the two books have nothing in common other than the time period!  I thought that The German Heiress was SO much better!  I hope that people won't dismiss it as just another WWII story because they will really be missing out!It takes place in Germany, in 1946, and the main character is struggling to survive like everyone else.  She is forced to come to terms with the choices she made during the war while she searches for her best friend that she hasn't seen since the night she fled her hometown and began living under a different name.  Everyone seems to know her face though, in spite of how hunger has changed it.  She was the famous ""Iron Fraulein,"" held up as a symbol of strength in German propaganda.  The British officers who have arrested her father for war crimes are hunting for her while she hunts for her friend, and decides who she wants to be when confronted with the truth about her wealthy family.

Having had to start my practice suddenly due to the need to bring cash into my home life meant that there were no plans made, only $1200 and left over supplies from a former massage therapy practice (which also did not pull a profit).  I had considered closing my practice every year for the previous four and resigned that I was not made to run a business.  However, I couldn't quit.  Not yet.  I was made aware of Mike through a women's business network and immediately purchased FTN.  I read it in 3 weeks and purchased his Toilet Paper Entrepreneur, Pumpkin Plan, and Profit First before I finished FTN.  I read the remaining three books in another three weeks.  For the first time in my career I had clarity, I had structure, I had foundation and I had a mentor and guide that spoke my (weird) language.  It's Q3 and my game plan is clear as I am using his books to build the various levels of the FTN pyramid.  I am excited about the future of my practice, the quality of my service, and the patients (pumpkin patients) I will be working more with in the future.  This book is a life-changer.  Mike is a amazing human being who truly cares about your success.  Get this book (and all the others) and take control of that which you thought was impossible to control.",5,0,1635,0.104,0
266,"""Live Love Now:  Relieve the Pressure and Find Real Connection with our Kids"" by Rachel Macy Stafford is a book written to shine a light on the challenges kids face today and offer the adults in their lives tools to connect with compassion, empathy, and honesty.  Rachel has written this book based on the feelings, hopes, worries, and fears of today's kids, her own and many others, offered to her in their own words.  But make no mistake, this book is for the adults in their lives.  Recognizing that we never had to face many of the stressors kids are dealing with today, or at least not to the same magnitude, Rachel reveals how we can use the tools she is providing to help kids navigate the journey.  Revealing life-giving practices to help us as adults process our own emotions and stressors, Rachel illuminates how we can then be available to the children in our lives in a way that is meaningful to them.With her usual finesse, Rachel is able to share her experiences, ideas, and research in a positive, welcoming, and sensitive way that makes her book a joy to read.  I love the balance of information, personal examples, and space for reflection, which allows us to examine the message and research, consider her experiences, and contemplate how it may apply in our own life.  Her testimonies offer hope that even when we make mistakes, there can be positive outcomes if we are open and honest with ourselves, our loved ones, and others.  And it is never too late to work on the relationships with the kids in our lives.  ""Live Love Now"" guides us to be positive role models, promoting a relationship that will support our kids through the challenges they face throughout childhood and beyond.",5,0,1704,0.224,0
267,"This is a frustrating book -- both excellent and poor.  Thus I can only give it a three star review.  (if it just had the positive aspects I report below I would have given it five.)The excellent stuff in the book is in two categories: factual studies and methodology of science.Excellent chapters that have detailed facts on biological processes, such as photosynthesis, insects using plants, how plants avoid being eaten, smoking and vaping details, etc.The second category is excellent chapters on the significant faults to guard against in nutritional epidemiological methodology.  This includes a great detailed description of the many, many methodological steps needed historically to prove, causally, that smoking leads frequently to lung cancer (and also why it doesn't do so most of the time.)On the negative side, two more categories: as problems.  One is mainly stylistic in that he seems fixated on writing as if he is a potty-mouthed 12 year old who revels in using all the gross words for bodily functions and yucky excretions.  It's not cute, but tiresome.  Two: despite so much good emphasis on a need for rigorous, logical methodology, he never defines highly processed foods, which is a core topic of the book, and while he bring in John Ioannidis work on methodology, and seems to be quite sympathetic to it, he ultimately waffles and doesn't come down on the side of rigor.  Lastly the last chapter (the appendix) on the absurd ""study"" of prayer as a means of cure is completely worthless and out of place in this book on reason and logic in science.But if you can hold your nose over the problems, there are some wonderful aspects of this book worth reading.",3,0,1679,0.083,1
268,"Great story!! this is what I need for these crazy times not only was light but also was heart-melting and very moving.Ally's life takes a very different path when she separates from her husband, trying to find a balance in her life she decided to continue searching for alternatives to help her daughter that has been very ill for such a long time, she is tired of the unknown always having a hard time to let go and trust in new methods to finally make her daughter healthy again.I love the determination and strength Ally shows at all times, trying to do what's best for her daughter even if she has to open a can of worms or situations that were buried behind but now she needs her past to know the next step for her daughter's treatment and future.Kylie is a wonderful character, she was very smart for her age and also very bold and sensitive, I love the way she always was kind to everybody no matter how hard was to feel good with her ups and down due to this terrible illness.. she was the silent glue that held Ally and the rest of the characters together.. she was the main reason for such an amazing adventure.The other family when I started this book I thought it was going to be the typical Comedy with a lot of irreverent laughable comments, but to my surprise, this book was very different in a very good way, I'm so glad I picked it, I enjoy it so much!!I don't want to give much away but The other family is a book that will give you hope, faith, and so much joy, it is a book that has the right amount of everything a little angst, a little sadness, but so much happiness.Overall it was Amazing!!",5,0,1614,0.278,0
269,"In THE VICTORY MACHINE, by Ethan Sherwood Strauss, the reader is guided through the creation of the perennially competitive and oft champion Golden State Warriors in the second half of the 2010s.  All aspects of the team's formation is covered, from the owner and the GM, to the coaches, to the players and how all of these components melded together in a way that created this unique mini-dynasty.  All the while, though, as Strauss declares in the subtitle ""The making & unmaking of the Warriors dynasty"", there were seeds of tension, weakness in the ranks, and indications of collapse in the near future.  Because Strauss writes for the Warriors regularly, he has insight and understanding about the franchise like few others.  He sprinkles in some stories, particularly about Kevin Durant, that are sometimes humorous, but often poignant, about the kind of team the Warriors were during their window of extreme success.  Speaking of Kevin Durant, or KD as he is referred, Strauss clearly places KD as the catalyst of the collapse and spends a long time defending that theory.  I am a fan of the NBA, but by no means an expert on today's game nor a well-studied basketball historian either and I felt like some of the references and comparisons made in the book went right past me because I wasn't fully educated in all things NBA.  THE VICTORY MACHINE is an insightful book about how a franchise works in today's sports world and in particular, how the Warriors franchise rode the wave of success but perhaps didn't see the signs of its own demise.

270,"As human beings, we tend to dwell on our inadequacies…in some ways, we allow ourselves to be defined by the things that go wrong in our lives, wearing them almost like an albatross around our necks, finding it extremely difficult to let go of the things that tear or knock us down, even when what happened was completely out of our control.For Kaylee and Ty, their pasts define their present and have been doing so for quite some time, and given the tragic nature of the events that categorically changed every part of who they were and where their lives were headed, it makes sense that they would be carrying their heartbreak and their baggage into their present-day lives.But as difficult as it is to shed the hurt, the pain, and the self-recriminations…as much as the unanswered questions and unspoken words threaten to upend them, Kaylee and Ty persevere, even if it’s one second…one minute…one hour at a time, and while there will be good days and bad days, ups and downs, steps forward and backward, together, they push through it all and work toward a second chance, both individually and as a couple.Kelly Elliott is my go-to romance author for emotional second-chance reads because it’s clear in the words she crafts and the characters she creates that she writes with her heart, taking her hero and heroine where they lead her, and doing so in a way that her readers can clearly see how far these characters have come and what they’ve overcome in order to live their best lives, and even though, the new path is not where they thought they would be, now, it’s the only place where they feel whole, not in a better way, but in a new way - one that makes them feel more than enough.4.5 Poison Apples",5,0,1708,0.084,1
271,"As a loyal reader of this author I almost gave this outing 3 stars, but I just couldn't.

273,"Review of:  The Last Hunt: A Benny Griessel Novel (Benny Griessel Mysteries)I was really pleased with ‘The Last Hunt’.  It has just about everything you want in a murder mystery … action, adventure, conflict; but with the wonderful addition of some South African flavor that brings this book up to a new, interesting level.I’m not going to go into any detail plot points and I’m certainly not going to give away any spoilers; if you must have that type of information you can pick up that information from the product page and from other reviewers.  But, really, you should read the book without much prior information so you can enjoy the plot as you turn the pages.This is the first Benny Griessel novel that I’ve read (it was followed by ‘Devil’s Peak’, ‘Thirteen Hours’, ‘Seven Days’, ‘Cobra’ and ‘Icarus).  Now, sometimes reading the most recent book without reading the previous books can be rather disappointing.  But that isn’t the case with “The Last Hunt” as it is so well written.  There aren’t a lot of glaring previous-book mentions that will cause you to stop and say “I don’t get it”.  The characters, I’m guessing many/most had been introduced in previous books, are still presented in a way that a first-time reader can follow along and not be lost.The characters in this novel come across as, well, for the lack of a better term, ‘real’.  They are not super heroes, they are not considered to be ‘genius’; they are true-to-life characters with individual strengths and individual weaknesses.  There are good people and there are bad people and there are just ‘people’, not necessarily good or bad just people trying to live their life.As for the murder/mystery aspect of the book, there are two pieces-of-the-puzzle that are critical to me.One of the most difficult aspects of writing a novel (and I’ve read many, many novels that fall short in this category) is speech.  When the characters in “The Last Hunt” talk, though, they sound ‘real’; not like Shakespearean actors trying to fit into the modern world.The second aspect of mystery novels that seems to be difficult for most, but not in this novel, is ‘clues’.  And I will say that for the most part (yes, I acknowledge the need to move the plot along in a novel otherwise it can quickly become boring), the clues presented in this book don’t just appear out of air but are discovered during what most people would consider as realistic police investigations.In closing, I feel it is important to mention that this book was originally written in Afrikaans and then translated into English.  So, a big shout out to K.L. Seegers for a just-right translation.  And what I mean by just-right is that not every word, not every sentence, not every though had to be scrubbed into English.  There is enough of the Afrikaans language left in the book to give the reader a view into the South African world, or at least the South African world has written by Deon Meyer.  The action, the situations are, after all, primarily in South Africa … so leaving in an Afrikaans phrase, instead of a translation, helps, for the lack of a better word once again, make the location, the circumstance, the moment seem more realistic.If you are looking for a good, perhaps something of the normal American-based murder/mystery/intrigue book, then most definitely keep “The Last Hunt” in mind.",5,0,3344,0.125,0
274,"I received a free copy of THE GLASS MAGICIAN by Caroline Stevermer in exchange for an honest review.  In New York 1905, there are primarily three types of people: there are normal people called Solitaires, shapeshifters called Traders, and a third type called the Sylvestry.  Twenty-year-old Thalia Cutler is a Solitaire working the Vaudeville circuit as “The Lady of the Lake,” magician extraordinaire.  Thalia, assisted by David Nutall-her father’s dearest friend, has been working the act alone since her parents’ early deaths.  When a trick goes wrong, something strange happens; Thalia believes an unexpected shapeshift saves her from certain doom.  However, she’s definitely not a shape Trader, so what happened?  Thereafter, Nutall and Thalia investigate the phenomenon to see if it is possible that Thalia could be a Trader late to blossom, the expert assures them that it’s entirely impossible.  Instead, the expert insists that Thalia’s panic simply caused her to hallucinate.  The expert congratulates Thalia on being a Solitaire because, if she were a newly-shifting Trader, she would now be hunted by Manticores, warped beings who devour the magic of vulnerable Traders.  Assured of Thalia’s normalcy, Thalia and Nutall travel to New York City for their next job.  Once in the city, things get really interesting.I liked this book.  I would classify it as turn of the twentieth century historical urban fantasy.  I recommend this tale to fans of historical fantasy (such as the Steampunk genre, the Thirteenth Child/Frontier Magic series, the Sorcery and Cecelia series, or the Sorcery and Society series) and to fans urban fantasy willing to delve into the past.  Also, as a bonus, the story is seeded with beautiful woodblock-type illustrations.#TheGlassMagician #NetGalley",5,0,1788,0.121,1
275,"Charlotte Finn inherited her great-uncle's farm - and has no idea what to do with it.  She'd been in advertising, but after a bad ad, she retreated in disgrace.  Things go from bad to worse when the real estate agent she asked to appraise the farm trips over the body of a young man with a pitchfork in his neck.  Now Charlotte and her friends Diane and Beau are stuck there until the sheriff finds a killer.  With plenty of suspects - including the town's bully brothers - Charlotte decides she needs to hurry things along if she wants to decide to keep the farm or not.  But does the killer decide to hurry things along, too, by making sure they're not found out?...As far as new series go, this is a pretty cute one, with a pig as Charlotte's main 'helper' in solving the murder.  While I'm not big on pigs myself as pets, and I certainly wouldn't allow one to sleep in my bed with me, granted it's a farm so Horse the pig fits right in.The mystery was done decently, and there were enough red herrings to keep people wondering who the killer was.  I would have liked to have known more about Charlotte's past (if she was in advertising, why was she broke, considering she stated she had her own staff), or even the secondary characters, but there's plenty of time for that in other books.When the killer was discovered it didn't really come as a surprise, since the clues were there all along, but I liked the plot and the inventive ways the characters came up with to keep the farm running while the murder investigation was being conducted.  It was an enjoyable read that can be done in an afternoon and a nice start to a new cozy series.",3,0,1644,0.112,0
276,"I’m going to write this review as if I’m talking right to the author.Just some random thoughts before I start scripting tomorrow morning:1) Loved the initial personal stories - makes it all real for me (the reader)2) Lynn Grabhorn - I loved her book when I purchased it years ago.  If I remember correctly (I will have to pull out my copy), one of her later books creeped me out a bit.  But I consider her first book seminal and a more modern version of a classic in this area.3) The mugging - if you don't mind I will manifest a more enjoyable introduction to scripting  :)4) Want list - I am curious to see how that changes over time since it is generated afresh each day5) Including the mundane - I read A LOT and like you I find much/most New Thought material very similar.  But this reminded me of a book that is definitely different in its presentation - The Practically Magical Use of Lists by J. Elprehzleinn.  Its first main exercise is a Winning list that is basically a list of mundane tasks you KNOW you will accomplish that day that you later recognize you have completed thereby training your mind to recognize you are a success.  I don't see many books that include the mundane as important - you are now one of them.6) I am going to have to dance with this whole process - including the Belief List.  From the place where I haven't started yet, for some reason, I feel like I might have a hard time with the Belief List.  So as I dance in the coming days (and take your advice not to overthink any of this), I will just see how it plays out.  And probably a good idea for me to go meta on this and include using this whole process as a part of my scripting - script to become fantastic at scripting7) Daily and 10 day scripting - the only thing that caught me off guard at first was the journaling at night which almost seemed like negative scripting if the days didn't align with the morning version.  But then I thought the continuous daily PULSE of the morning script and evening journaling was GUARANTEEING focus on the importance of each and every day and not just on some hazy far off huge goal.8) I love the science stuff too.  Familiar with much of it but you definitely have researched a lot and there were things in there I had not come across myself.9) David Hoffmann and the Simulation stuff - it might actually be more helpful to NOT perceive reality as it is - WOW - that is definitely a new one for me.  And the computer desktop analogy was perfect for me to GET it.10) Fatum Bot - not sure what to say yet about that - gotta play with that.  It is just amazing to me that it is something that can be played with.  And by the average person.11) I am going meta meta (or meta squared) with this - being a master manifester12) Memes - opened my mind to the influence of them13) Picture Scripting - as I was reading this, it occurred to me that most people's vision boards are the visual equivalent of the Want List.  And your Picture Scripting is something different and like your written scripting (duh!).As you can tell, I devoured the book.  Now I need to start having fun with your process.  Assuming success in the coming days and weeks, I look forward to sharing a few wins someday soon.",5,0,3222,0.196,1
277,"I have been working in the Silicon Valley for and with tech companies for over a decade and also have extensive experience working and volunteering with entrepreneurs in developing markets.  This book is incredibly timely as many of the questions are extremely relevant in a time where we are seeing massive companies rising from markets outside the Silicon Valley that did not follow the same strategies and practices that Google, Facebook, and Uber did.  These companies have carved their own paths, and Alexandre does a fantastic job of distilling some of the commonalities and differences from the Silicon Valley’s best practices and mantras.Two themes in particular resonated with me.  The first is the insight and foresight of Frontier Innovators (many of whom have lived and traveled in multiple global markets in their careers) to take global technology trends and merge these with local preferences.  Their ability to meld these ideas gives them a distinct advantage, but still requires an enormous amount of persistence to execute.Secondly, the book talks about a tension between growth at all costs versus a focus on resilience and long-term viability.  This theme will become even more important in 2020 as companies struggle with the current global pandemic.  I suspect that the Silicon Valley will look to some of the Frontier markets for strategies to optimize their operations in these times.Overall, I found this book to be a fast read that asks a lot of very relevant questions and shows how entrepreneurs are responding to these challenges in different markets.  Given the current environment, I suspect much of this book will become a reality in the coming years, even in the Silicon Valley.",5,0,1711,0.065,1
278,"I just finished listening to Lance Allred's book - The New Alpha Male, read by the author.  I truly enjoyed it.  It is a special breed of nonfiction in that it isn't a memoir, but has some elements of that genre.  Lance will take you through a journey of what he's learned in his life.  While on this journey he will offer you the chance for self examination and give you concrete ideas for change.This book is very bold and doesn't sugar coat anything - the good and the bad.  I felt like I was walking an evolution with Lance through the book and was inspired by the events of the book, challenged by the questions, and motivated by his applications to life.Although this book is geared to the ""male"" I think anyone can find solutions and help in it.  It reminded me of many things I want to be doing better and showed me some ""work"" I can do.  It also gave me pertinent ideas as I raise my own sons and I truly want them to be the very best and balanced men they can be.And of course, throughout all of it I was touched by Lance's honesty, willingness to be vulnerable, and his bravery and skill in storytelling.This book focuses in some parts on the spiritual arena, but does not give sway to any particular religion.  In that way, anyone can read it and find meaning they are looking for while applying it to their own ideals.If you want to take Lance's challenges to heart I would say having a hard copy is a good idea.  That way you can look at his ""do the work"" sections in print.  That being said, I LOVED the audio version, so I'd also recommend that.  Pick one (or both), you can't go wrong.",5,0,1602,0.235,1
279,"Jack Carr introduced the world to James Reece in his 2018 critically acclaimed book The Terminal List.  As a debut author he wrote arguable one of the best thrillers of the year.  With his follow up novel, True Believer, Jack proved that he wasn't a one hit wonder, that he actually deserved a seat at the table, and a spot on our bookshelves.  With Savage Son, the third installment of the James Reece saga, Carr cements his spot as one of the top thriller writters of all time.  He belongs in the HOF along side the likes of John le Carre, Tom Clancy, Clive Cussler, and his more modern peers of Brad Thor and Daniel Silva.  Jack Carr is a bona fide superstar when it comes to thriller writers.James Reese was a man of vengeance in The Terminal List.  He was seeking retribution against all who had betrayed him and his unit, and ultimately destroying his family.  As a man dying with a brain tumor, he was hell bent on destruction of all who had made his list.  In True Believer Reese sought solace and personal redemption in the wilds of Africa, assisting on a game preserve belonging to one of his closest friend's family before answering another call to serve.  In Savage Son we find Reece continuing his journey to inner peace and health, recovering from surgery to remove the brain tumor. Tucked away in Montana on secluded family acreage of the same friend, James continues his physical as well as emotional and spiritual recovery.Readers can see the synopsis of the book, so I won't rehash it here.  Savage Son quickly turns into a story of the lengths a man will go to save everything he holds most precious and dear.  It is the releasing of the caged, inner demon as the ultimate game is played, man hunting man.  The savagery of the hunt is very well written and becomes easy for the reader to see and live within, very much like a VR movie.  The reader is a witness to Reece being hunted, and next to him as the tables are turned, and Reece moves from a defensive position to one of offense.  From the opening scene of the book, which is emotionally gripping, and leaves questions to be answered throughout the story, Carr has a book that is intense and gripping, begging the reader to finish one more chapter, one more page, one more sentence.  It is one of the toughest books to put down that I have read in a very long time.  Another highlight of Savage Son is that I was left thinking and pondering on the story for days after finishing it.  The story resonates deep within, and forces the reader to think and evaluate their own beliefs and norms, as well as the depths of their own humanity, and most importantly, the monster that resides in the deep, dark recesses of our own soul.The series is best read in order to experience the progression of development, but each book can definitely be read as a stand alone novel.At the end of 2020, as book awards are being considered, Savage Son will be standing as one of, if not the, top thrillers of the year.  It may very well need a category for itself so other authors and books can be recognized.  It is THAT good.I received an advance copy of the book from Emily Bestler Books and Atria in exchange for my thoughts and opinions on the book.",5,0,3210,0.097,1
280,"Murder in the Storybook Cottage by Ellery Adams has Jane Steward busy preparing for the upcoming Peppermint Press Conference for children’s authors and illustrators at Storyton Hall.  She also has the first Golden Ticket winners arriving the next day and Jane wants to make sure that the Gilbert family have a magical vacation.  Jane has a special surprise for the Cover Girls (her book club).  They take a sleigh ride to the new Storybook Village which will open to children of all ages on Friday.  The ladies are delighted with the fairy tale houses and the activities available in each one until they stumble upon a woman in a red cloak with a basket nearby laying on the floor of Belle’s house.  There is a valuable copy of Grimm’s Fairy Tales in the basket.  Jane is shocked when a couple of a days later another woman turns up dead in the woods wearing a blue parka with white fur trim with a copy of Fairy Tales by Hans Christian Andersen left in her room. Jane and her loyal Fins needs to catch the Fairy Tale Killer before he strikes again.  Murder in the Storybook Cottage is the delightful 6th installment in A Book Retreat Mystery series.  It can be read on its own for those new to this book themed series.  It is a joy to visit Storyton Hall in Storyton, Virginia with all the fabulous books, special events and scrumptious food.  I love the books, authors and literary characters mentioned throughout the story.  My favorite was Raggedy Ann and the Lucky Pennies (I collect Raggedy Ann items).  Storyton Village is a magical addition to the resort with the adorable fairy tale themed little cottages.  There is the gingerbread house, Rapunzel’s tower, Belle’s house, and Rumpelstiltskin’s workshop (just to name a few).  There are enchanting events for the guests to attend at Storyton Hall including the colorful Rainbow Tea and the Family Valentine’s Celebration.  I thought Murder in the Storybook Cottage was well-written with developed characters and special setting.  It is rich in detail that allows the reader to visualize the captivating setting.  I always enjoy reading each A Book Retreat Mystery to catch up with the characters who inhabit this world.  Jane’s twin boys are up to their usual mischief, Eugenia Pratt’s beau is coming to town and he has big news to share with her, Lachlan has something special planned for Valentine’s Day for his girlfriend and Jane’s bestie, Eloise Alcott.  The mystery was intriguing with its fairy tale theme.  There are a variety of suspects including a very dislikeable couple who write children’s books.  I enjoyed the misdirection as well as following the clues to find out why someone killed the two women.  My favorite quote from Murder in the Storybook Cottage is when Jane was saying the ladies did not read the books for happy endings.  “It was the journey they were interested in--the voyage from the first page to the last.” There is a hint at what will occur in the next A Book Retreat Mystery at the end.  Murder in the Storybook Cottage is a diverting cozy mystery with fairy tale fun, wonderful Wonka Bars, a terrible twosome, a clever killer, fun family festivities, and bibliophile bliss.*I voluntarily read an advanced copy of this book.

281,"This was a decent book that was a really fast read.  It centers primarily on Charlotte, who is an obsessive mother of 5 year old Daisy, and her brother Rocco's girlfriend, Ruth, who may or may not have something to hide.  Rocco has a history of dating unsuitable girls so when Charlotte is introduced to Ruth, she is not that welcoming, but there continue to be gaps in Ruth's version of various things that causes her to be even more skeptical.  Ruth ends up picking up Daisy from school, which she is not authorized to do, and the book goes back and forth between Charlotte's search for her child in the present and the events leading up to that day.The chapters alternate between Charlotte, Ruth, and Rocco.  Oddly, Ruth's chapters are in the first person whereas Charlotte's are in the 3rd person, which I found odd, as Charlotte appears to be the primary character in the book.  None of these characters are very likable and I didn't really understand the dynamic between Charlotte and Rocco, or any of them with their mother.I had an inkling about what was going on with Ruth almost from the beginning and turned out to be mostly right.  I would guess that many readers of the genre would be able to figure out what is going on.  That being said, it was a twisty read, fraught with an overall tension that something bad was going to happen any minute now.Overall, this book is worth the read for those who like the psychological thriller/domestic suspense genres and are looking for a fast-paced and overall quick read, but doesn't really stand out.Thanks to Netgalley for providing me a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.",3,0,1645,0.046,0
282,"For the record, I received an Advanced Review Copy (ARC) of this book with the request that I leave a voluntary honest review for other potential readers.  I prefer to not give spoilers in my reviews so that they are safe to read.  All of that having been said, here is my honest opinion and review of this book:  This story's plot line was very interesting with intriguing villians and loveable characters as well as tons of twists and turns to keep you guessing where the story will go from here.  The action scenes are intense and exciting.  Both the world building and the character development were well executed and pretty authentic.  Each of the metal and stone combinations created to represent the various kingdoms and empires was a brilliant idea.  Our heroes (though endearing, can be a bit slow on the uptake and are not very street wise) are not what they seem and the ending is quite a surprise.  I most definitely did not see that outcome developing (and it isn't easy to surprise me).  My wish is that Ettian would just speak his true feelings.  The Umber Empire really needs a reality check (it is not a great idea to be so vile).  Everything in this story flows smoothly from start to finish with an easy to read writing style that I enjoyed and that really engages the readerand draws them into the story from the beginning.  Based upon the 5 criteria that I look for in a great book, I give this story full marks of 5 out of 5 stars.  This story is definitely worth the time it takes to read it.  I look forward to reading the sequel with great anticipation when it is ready.",5,0,1595,0.197,0
283,"Lightning can strike the same place twice.  Or, in other words, Darynda Jones has another hit for us.  It was like being back in a familiar world where the setting might be new as well as the faces, but I still felt like I knew them somehow.  Giggleworthy wit, twisting plot threads, quirky characters, a bit of woowoo, and a riveting first in series that left me groaning for the next book.ReviewA Bad Day for Sunshine opens on Sunshine Vicram’s first day of county sheriff in Del Sol, New Mexico, her home town.  Oddly, she won an election she didn’t actually run in or want to win, but her adorable parents and her spritely teenage daughter, Auri, are tickled she got the job and is back.  Not that she isn’t qualified- she was a Santa Fe detective for years, but a dark moment in her past drove her away and would have kept her away in spite of her deep feelings for one brooding hottie, Levi Ravinder.But, her first day begins with a missing girl, a prison escapee, and trouble for Auri as the new girl.  Sunshine quips her way through first day with best buddy Quincy as her chief deputy at her side.  Don’t let the light manners and pretty face fool you.  She has a first-class mind and can keep up just fine with all the craziness that Del Sol can throw at one.  Too bad that dark nightmare and her childhood hot crush might be one and the same.The book jumps right in a a clipping pace and the reader better fasten in or get left in the dust.  Sunshine was an immediate reader crush for me as were every other character I encountered along the way including the secondary storyline of Auri, her daughter doing the treacherous gauntlet that is high school.  Both are strong intelligent female leads that crack their jokes and have a strong mother-daughter bond because of Sunshine’s heartbreaking past.  Her parents were salt of the earth and backed her up through all that and into the present.This book set up the series and slid into a dire group of current cases and Sunshine’s own cold case.  Sunshine and her posse work it all and the zany zinging around was no trouble to follow.  I loved the intro to the group of older gals that pal around with Sunshine’s mom, her own circle of friends that are as loyal and fun as they come, the redneck and southern Ravinder clan who live ‘back in the hills’ of New Mexico making shine, and of course Auri’s growing circle of friends.  Quite the colorful layers for this cast of characters.There is a slow burn romance for Sunshine even as Auri has her first girl crush and romance with the school’s heartthrob, Cruz.  Levi Ravinder is sizzling and there are some nice sultry teasers that foreshadow things though his connection to Sunshine’s own cold case does have her torn in two directions just as the trouble with his family clan is still problematic. Pretty sure these storylines will carry over through the series.Woven through the book is a hint of magical realism in the form of psychic talent and one fun little crossover moment with the previous Charley Davidson series.So, all in all, this was an abso-fab winner that will soothe Charley Davidson-loving hearts though will come to love Sunshine Vicram in her own right.  Romantic Suspense fans should get in on this one from the beginning.",4,0,3254,0.217,1
284,"As I started reading this book about two women who became widows, when their husbands who were brothers died in a tragic accident, I quickly found myself caught up in the story.  These two women approached their grief with very different outlooks.  But when Eva received a call about an ultra marathon their husbands were supposed to have participated in with Brent’s best friend, life changes for both.Eva seems to have it all in Angela’s mind.  She does not have three children depending on her.  At the same time, Eva sometimes envies Angela having the three children she has to come home to at the end of a day.Marc, Brent’s partner, and his best friend set out to train with the two women for the marathon.  The ups and downs of grief and attempting to move on are captured in a way that resonated with me.  I loved how Sherry, Eva, and Angela’s mother-in-law comes alongside the two women and shares her own experience of becoming a widow.Having never experienced a spouse dying myself, I can not begin to fathom the depths of grief these women were dealing with at all.  But I love how Sherry encourages the women to seek to find joy rather than happiness.  She states that joy comes from having a true relationship with God.These three women, Marc, and Simon create an incredible look at what facing grief while also moving on with life looks like.  I found myself laughing, crying, and rooting for the three to finish the marathon, but also found myself wanting them to step out in faith and take a chance on loving again.So check out this book for yourself.I received a copy of this book for my fair and honest review.",5,0,1628,0.239,0
285,"I finished reading the newest writing from John Maxwell,""Put Your Dream To The Test-10 Questions That Will Help You See It and Seize It"" a few weeks ago but have held off on posting a review because I wanted to put more of what was mentioned in the book into practice.  In this book Maxwell gives the reader tools to use to evaluate your dreams.  The book is broken down into chapters that address different ""measuring sticks"" to discern which dreams are the ones that you hold onto and fight for all that it's worth and those that you let go of to move on to what you should be going after.I've read many books by John Maxwell before and this one I have found to be my favorite so far.  It is highly practical and applicable in many areas of life.  Rather than just being a ministry book or leadership book this tackles the topic of dreams and goals that we have for our lives.  We all should have dreams and goals so it is helps the average person reading the book.Many of us have lofty dreams of changing the world or creating the next big thing.  This book gives great insight into whether those dreams are ones to pursue or dreams that we have created that will become a distraction to the things that we should be moving towards accomplishing.  With questions that help you dig below the surface of your dreams this book is a great resource for anyone wondering if they should grab hold of or let go of a dream.  I recommend this book to all.  But don't just read it to say you have read it.  Make use of the questions and use the practical exercises to help you achieve your dreams.",4,0,1589,0.215,0
286,"I have been following Amanda through her weekly fridge foraging episodes over the past couple years.  Her passion for creating approachable, delicious, and beautiful food from the resources inside her fridge has always been an inspiration to me.  Amanda has a way of utilizing creativity along with functionality to an everyday meal, and this is apparent in her cookbook, Simple Beautiful Food!  Being a cookbook ambassador, I received the book a couple weeks prior to the launch so was able to read through all the chapters as well as test recipes across the book.  I started with the baked eggs in prosciutto cups (recipes to start your day), zucchini banana muffins (snacks & bar bits), one of her favorite recipes - the dukkah crusted crispy chicken cutlet with an herb salad (weeknight eats), which quickly became a favorite for the whole family, and finally the peanut and pistachio dukkah (flavor gold).  Across the board, these dishes were enjoyable to pull together as they featured household staples for me and pulled together plenty of flavor.  A highlight of the book is the chapter called ""Flavor Gold"" - it is exactly as it sounds, a grouping of recipes you can make that enhance the flavor across numerous dishes, and ones you can have on hand in the fridge or countertop at any time.  All in all, I recommend this cookbook for anyone looking to make everyday food in a beautiful and delicious way, there are also numerous riffs and substitutions offered allowing you to have flexibility in the dishes, each time you make them.  I look forward to cooking and baking more recipes from this cookbook!Thanks for the free book, Ten Speed Press and Amanda Frederickson!",5,0,1679,0.182,0
287,"JL Markham, 15 years old, has her whole life in front of her.  But these first 15 have not always been easy.  Her once unbreakable friendship with Aubrey has fallen apart, her father has been in California for work for way longer than he was supposed to, and her mom is suffering from a sometimes debilitating mental illness in his absence.  The bright spot in her life is Max Gordon, her nineteen-year-old boyfriend.  A senior at 19, Max is often misjudged, but JL feels like she knows the real Max, a kindhearted, smart, and well-read kid.  But Max is graduating and he is leaving for California.  JL now has to decide if she is going with him.  With her dad already there, her mom spiraling deeper into her illness, and no real relationship with Aubrey, what does she have keeping her home?  JL must figure out who she is and what she wants out of this life.  And in the end she may discover she isn't as fragile as she once believed she was.Gae Polisner has given us a beautiful coming of age story about friendship, love, self-discovery, and probably most important, resilience.  In JL's character, we have a young girl who is trying to navigate a world where she has lost her closest friend, but has also fallen in love for the first time.  A girl trying to find a balance between her boyfriend and her crumbling family.  A girl who discovers the strength that has been hiding deep inside.  We see a character who eventually realizes that she can withstand much more than she ever thought possible.

288,"When Conor Knighton’s fiancée left him, he wasn’t sure quite what to do until he saw a promotion talking about the National Park’s 100th anniversary.  Soon, he was making plans to visit all of the official National Parks in 2016, reporting on some of them for CBS Sunday Morning.  After experiencing sunrise on New Year’s Day in Acadia, he crisscrossed the country numerous times in his quest to experience all of them.When I first heard about this book, I was intrigued.  I’ve long wanted to visit all of the parks myself, not that I’ve done much more than think about it.  When this book focuses on the parks and some of their history, it is fascinating.  The writing is excellent, and it is easy to feel you are right next to him as he experiences the parks.  However, at times he gets distracted trying to push an agenda on us, and when that happens, the parks get shafted.  A few of the parks he barely describes, focusing instead on the bad he feels needs to be fixed or pointing out the bad in the past that has been fixed.  Even when I agreed with his point, I found this frustrating because it’s not what I wanted to read about when I picked up the book.  He definitely made me want to visit several of the parks as soon as I can.  His brief stories about his life and his stories about the people he met along the way were fun and fascinating.  There are two inserts of pictures from his journey; I would have loved more, but I enjoyed what we got.  I wish the book had focused more on the parks themselves.  Then it would have been fantastic.",3,0,1553,0.12,1
289,"I signed up for Temper not realizing that it was book #3 in the series.  It wasn’t until I was done and looking at Goodreads that I saw that there were two books previously.  It explained why, at times, I felt like I came into a conversation that was 1/4 of the way in, was able to pick up what was going on and keep up but missing a couple of things.  Luckily, the story is about Temper and Abbie exclusively so that the core of the story about them is complete unto itself.Temper is the president of the Knights Fury MC and this is a fairly recent event.  The last president, Hammer, passed away and Temper has taken up the mantle.  Abbie knows Temper from his years of coming into her bar during MC runs and turning him down when he asks her out each time.  This time, she decides that she is tired of not having any fun in her life because taking care of her sister and mother has taken precedent and says yes.  This happens to be the run that Temper and his crew kill a man when they are ambushed, forcing them to take Abbie with them to California to keep her safe.The story is well balanced and hefty with interaction with several side characters.  Temper and Abbie have good chemistry and their heated scenes will bring a sweat.  The action, in the beginning, is interesting and swings through a couple of twists and turns towards the end.  There is a slightly outlandish connection between Abbie, the MC, and a drug dealer that threw me a little but made for good reading.Overall, a good MC book with the right amount of romance.",4,0,1538,0.111,0

Then you throw in Jiggs, the dog and it was an absolute winner!!Piper and Harley have known each other for years...as friends.  Piper is a commitment-phobe if there ever was one and Harley is the perfect guy for any woman to settle down with.  The problem is he wants her....he just has to convince her.  This was a great friends-to-lovers book.  You couldn't help but cheer for this couple.  I won't say there weren't moments that I wanted to throw my e-reader because Piper could definitely frustrate me, but she had issues so what could I do?  I kept reading.  Piper is a very independent woman to the point that many men have been threatened by her job and confidence.  She's a very take charge person - - you have to love that about her.  What I didn't love was how hard she made things for Harley at times.Harley is a family man through and through.  He's spent his life taking care of his family and cleaning up his brother's messes.  He prioritizes his mother, sister and nieces above himself.  If she'll let him, he'll prioritize Harley above himself as well...but she's a bit gun-shy of that level of commitment.  It's a good thing that Harley is also quite determined because he will have to be to get through to her.The secondary characters are awesome as well.  I see potential for at least two more books after this one and I'm super excited about that.  Even though this book is part of a series, you can easily read it as a standalone.Thank you to NetGalley for this readers copy in exchange for an honest review.",4,0,1603,0.214,0
291,"I have long known that front-line employees are full of ideas to improve their company and to make their work more efficient.  Often, their ideas come from a “complain” but an astute manager will dig into the complaint to determine whether there is an improvement opportunity.  Together, the manager and employee can work to improve the company based upon these “ideas.”Building on their prior book Ideas are Free, the authors have laid out a virtual manifesto on how to drive organizational change by involving front-line employees.  The concept of asking employees for their ideas seems relatively simple, but the book goes into great detail about the process, and how it can be derailed if the appropriate culture is not established in advance.  This is very practical advice, but I’m not sure how I will curb my excitement about idea-gathering long enough to change the culture first!  I have read other books that promulgate the same basic principle of asking employees for ideas, and this book is among the best I’ve read.What sets this book apart for me is that it reads like a how-to manual rather than a theoretical discussion.  The authors don’t come off as lofty professors with little real-world experience.  Rather, they cite many examples of companies that they have worked with, and how the idea-generation process has transformed organizations, ranging in size from small to global.  In fact, I even read about the successes of a company I’m affiliated with, which lent quite a bit of legitimacy to their concept.Frankly, the only thing missing was the authors’ business cards, so I can contact them to help me work through the changes at my company.",5,0,1666,0.155,1
292,"This debut novel  takes place in Mexico - specifically in the rugged mountain terrain of Oaxaca.  What started out as a traditional romance novel ended up being so much more.  I learned about the language of the area, some of the customs and the lifestyle of the people who live here.Camille is on a quest to find her protégé and bring her home for her concert that will pave the way for her to launch her career as  a concert pianist.  Young Graciela had fled to Oaxaca to help her sick mother so Camille headed there to find her.  Camille had been a  studying to be a pianist until an accident caused damage to her hand and ended her career.  She now taught piano lessons and Graciela was her one hope of feeling like a winner again.  Camille is totally out of her comfort zone on the bus trip to Oaxaca and when the bus is in an accident and she loses her passport and money, she is in over her head.  She's befriended by a local man who takes her to his village so she can decide what to do next.  She is definitely attracted to him but he isn't happy with her plan to take her student home and knows that  it's more to help her feel like a success than it is for Graciela.This is a story of self-discovery, love and forgiveness with romance sprinkled in.  It touches on issues like immigration and the life of  un-documented workers in the US.  I learned a lot about the people and the culture in this part of Mexico and found this book to be both entertaining as well as educational.  I highly recommend this book!",4,0,1520,0.189,0
293,"I am so glad that Heather Blake’s Wishcraft Mystery series is continuing with a new publisher.  This is one of my favorite paranormal cozy series, and TO CATCH A WITCH is well worth the wait.  The series gets better, if that is possible, with each additional book.This time around, Darcy is hired to organize the annual Wicked Mad Dash by Abby Stillwell.  Things go from bad with the blizzard like weather to worse when Abby goes missing and is later found deceased.  When it becomes apparent that Abby’s death is murder, Darcy is tasked, as the appointed Investigator for the Craft, with getting to the bottom of things.  In addition, Darcy is worried about her ill sister Harper and her family’s increasingly aggravating nemesis.Heather Blake does a fantastic job building this whimsical world in the midst of Salem, Massachusetts.  The magical atmosphere, different types of witches, and familiars all seem real.  Why shouldn’t it be plausible that a Shakespearian actor turned familiar parrot over imbibe on rum?  It really does all make sense and is endlessly entertaining.  I enjoy all of the recurring characters, even the nasty ones, and reading TO CATCH A WITCH is like catching up with dear friends.The mystery is well thought out and the writing nicely paced.  I was a bit surprised by the killer’s identity, and that rarely happens.  Though the story is indeed lighthearted, the timely undercurrent of racism and elitism is explored.I adore TO CATCH A WISH and highly recommend it to any paranormal cozy reader.I received and ARC of this title from the publisher and voluntarily shared my thoughts here.",4,0,1615,0.166,0

Addie Greyborne attends an auction preview at the notorious Hill House in Greyborne Harbor with the expectation of replenishing stock for her bookstore.  When she arrives, she finds an old family friend in charge of the auction, and things are falling apart; priced inventory is missing, and new items have not been evaluated and priced.  Addie is delighted to be able to render assistance, so she spends the day evaluating and pricing rare tomes, and some of them are extremely rare and valuable.  The next day, Addie and her family friend uncover a locked-room mystery; a woman is dead, and a set of newly-priced first edition Sherlock Holmes books are missing.  Addie soon finds herself under attack from an unexpected quarter.  Matt is back in town, and he’s nursing a bitter grudge; he and his FBI associate, Riley, are determined to stretch the facts of the case to pin both murder and grand larceny on Addie.  Addie fights back with the truth.  If she can find the real culprit, then she can go free, at least until the next crime.

This man does love his desserts.When I first picked up the book, I was a bit puzzled about the title because I had no clue what a marmot could possibly be and of course I didn't go look it up ahead of time.  A marmot is a rodent, similar to a squirrel is my best explanation and Merlin has decided this is what is going to be his familiar...that is after a rocky start with other possibilities.Kailyn has a rocky road with this murder.  She has to remember the passing of her childhood friend, Scott, in a tragic accident in high school and then at the 10 year class reunion, another friend is found dead.  This sets Kailyn off on the road to discover who might have killer her friend and what was the secret behind Scott's death.  I honestly had no clue how this story was going to play out.  There are many potential suspects but none of them seemed to be the right fit.  When the truth is revealed, I was quite surprised and didn't expect it to turn out the way that it did.Travis is still around and in a relationship with Kailyn and it is a good thing he knows and understands her magick abilities.

The further I read in the book that more I understood and realized how much I had/was hurting my wife, not in a physical way, but rather mentally & emotionally by the way I didn't treasure her and what she wanted to and was able to contribute to our marriage.

This is not a ""religious"" book per se, although the author acknowledges that the love God wants us to give our wives is unselfish, honest, and regularly dispensed.  If you, as a husband, are not in a good/great marriage I would consider this book a MUST READ...if you have a good/great marriage, I still think this book is an excellent book to remind us of the treasure and gift that God gives us in our wives...and this book helps us all to consider this and inspires us to love our wives in the way they need and the way we should!",5,0,1545,0.152,1
297,"Rating: 4 humorous (strictly human) starsWhat a great start to a new mystery series by Darynda Jones.  Unlike her Charley Davidson series, this one doesn’t have a single paranormal creature.  Never fear though, the humans and an elusive rooster, who inhabit Del Sol, New Mexico have plenty of their own humorous quirks.  Its Sunshine Vicram’s first day on the job as sheriff.  Sunshine left Del Sol years ago, and never intended to return.  Then she was entered into the election for town sheriff, and won.  She returns with her fourteen-year-old daughter Aurora, nicknamed Auri.  They both struggle to find their place in town.They alternately each narrate their story of settling in as sheriff, and settling in to a new town and a new school.  Neither of them has a smooth ride.  Sunshine is faced with a missing teenaged girl on her first day on the job.  Auri has to battle mean girls and bullying at the high school and her penchant for amateur sleuthing.  Sunshine’s old crush Levi Ravinder complicates the mix of the cast of characters.This is a fun and wild ride.  It contains the trademark Darynda Jones humor.  It is a lighthearted romp with a surprisingly good mystery.  I look forward to more visits to Del Sol, NM in the near future.  This is the first book in what I hope develops into a very entertaining series.  I’d recommend this to readers who like their mysteries on the guffaw-filled side rather than filled with nail-biting suspense.‘Thank-You’ to NetGalley; the publisher, St Martin’s Press; and the author, Darynda Jones, for providing a free e-ARC copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.",4,0,1624,0.184,0
298,"Wonderful historical fiction that gave me some insight into a period of time and place that I knew little about.  Sure, I grasped the basic history of this period of time in London, England, but this story brought the human aspect smack, right up in my face.  I felt the injustice, the discomfort and misery, the fears, the brutality--and yet--people kept going.  And there was plenty of the positives of the human condition:  Compassion and encouragement, quirkiness, dedication and honesty, to prevent the story's feel from getting too down and dark.Common to all times and places, a mother's fierceness, her intuitiveness, her dedication, love and hope are all very evident in this book.  So, it seems the author does a fine job of accentuating the similarities and the differences of us now, and back ""then"".  And that allows the book to feel very realistic and credible.It seemed to be sluggish sometimes, but that was probably because there was not a whole lot of conversation.  I''m not sure how a conversation would sound from that time period....Probably very foreign to our ears.  So it was probably for the best that conversations were kept to a minimum.  There was enough action in the book to keep me turning pages.  Seems like hope and apprehension kept me reading.The author did a fine job of setting the stage for my mind's eyes.  It seemed very real to me.I'm glad to have read this book--Not so light-hearted as what I've been trying to read during this strange time in our own current history.

Kate is helping her new friend Maxi install a raised garden when Kate’s half-grown labradoodle takes an interest and decides to help them dig.  Soon, Oliver has uncovered a skeleton wearing what appears to be a pirate outfit.  Is it the remains of Sir George Bly, a pirate and privateer who helped establish the Cay?  The publicity arising from the discovery of the remains arrives just in time for the town’s annual pirate festival.  Drawn to the mystery of what happened to Gentleman George, Kate and her friends begin to research the infamous pirate.  Also, if the body isn’t Sir George, who is it, and how did it get in Maxi’s garden?  At the same time, Kate is unexpectedly besieged by male admirers: her ex-fiancé has arrived in town with goal of winning back Kate’s affections; a recently-separated but not yet divorced wealthy older gentleman named Harper Duvall starts pitching woo (and roses) in Kate’s direction; and the town’s new veterinarian is very nice and very nice looking.I liked this book.

The story follows a journey from Missouri to California in a wagon train.  Going across the country in the 1850's was not easy.  There were bugs, lack of water or difficult crossing of water, fire wood could be scarce, diseases, death, hunger, & Indians were some of the threats to these determined people.Naomi and her family join a wagon train.  They face many hardships in their travels.  Naomi is a talented artist which helps her along the way and is woven throughout the book.  Naomi is also newly widowed.  She chose to travel with her family even though her in-laws were part of the wagon train.  This does causes some tension in the group.John is a mule man and was supposed to deliver some mules to a fort along the way and return home.  John basically finds love at first site of Naomi.  John has inner demons about his being loved and accepted and personal conflicts about being half white and half Indian.  John and Naomi have a nice courtship and romance on the trail west with some near misses on being together.While this story is not entirely new, it is well written.

It is definitely the Elevators’ bible.My high school friends and I used to see them live while growing up in Texas.  At age 17, Tommy Hall was the first esotericist that I had ever encountered.  The Perennial Philosophy that these songs introduced me to later inspired me to get a master’s degree in Interdisciplinary Consciousness Studies.  I have since devoted 5 decades to the study and teaching of the Ageless Wisdom that Tommy (and Powell St. John) revealed in the songs on the first 2 Elevators albums.  I describe Tommy’s masterpiece, ‘Slip Inside This House’ as the Ageless Wisdom in 8 minutes—with a good backbeat!And, of course, their lyrics were sung by the inimitable, captivating voice of Roky Erickson—whether he was verbally emoting sensitive ballads or shrieking rocking, garage-band, psychedelic poems propelled by Stacy’s uniquely soulful, yet driving 6-strings, and an incomparable rhythm section.]So, you can imagine how excited I was to discover that Drummond had written a new, illustrated history of the band, The 13th Floor Elevators: A Visual History.  I like the way that Paul let the Elevators and their family, friends, and associates retell much of the band’s story through firsthand accounts--as told by direct quotes from those who were there.But, what really makes this new book a must for all Elevator fans, both old and new, are the amazing illustrations from Drummond’s unrivaled, comprehensive archive of Elevators’ photos (many in color), posters, tickets, and other invaluable memorabilia.  They take the reader right back to those ‘thrilling days of yesteryear’ (‘The Lone Ranger’ TV show intro).  You are visually transported back to those inspiring, exciting, revolutionary days of the late ‘60s to experience the most ground-breaking, mind-waking, butt-shaking, earth-quaking band ever--and all of their fearless psychedelic escapades in Austin, Kerrville, Houston, Dallas, San Francisco, Los Angeles and all points in between.The book’s oversized format makes the illustrations that much larger, so that you can easily read the small print on documents and see the faces close up.  Just flipping through the tome’s 300+ pages right now, I would estimate that there are as many pages of illustrations (rare photos, posters, documents, etc.) as there are pages of text.  And each visual entry has an in-depth description of what is being shown.Another part of the book that I found particularly helpful are the three pages devoted to the Cast of Characters which contains each person’s name and their relation to the Elevators.  That’s just one of the many attractive features of this handsomely illustrated history of the group that has been assembled and written by the foremost authority and archivist of the world’s first psychedelic band.  I would highly recommend that you get a copy while they are still available.  It’s a book that you will want to revisit often for the rest of your life.

303,"Disastrous climate change… economic disintegration… assassination of president… gang warfare… good cop vs. bad cop… all combine to make “Sons of War” a riveting account of the struggle for the soul of Los Angeles in the wake of near-apocalyptic events.Nicholas Smith, the award-winning author of the Extinction, Orbs, and Hell Divers series, has hit a home run with this novel which is a study in contrasts of two family on opposite sides of the law during a time of utter chaos.  One is the Moretti family who were forced to flee Naples to Los Angeles during an internecine Mafia power struggle eight years earlier.  Don Antonio is determined to eliminate the opposition and become the crime boss of LA.  Although guided by the strict mafia omertà code of honor and silence, his techniques are brutal.  The other is a Marine family headed by SSG Ronaldo Salvatore whose son, Dom, becomes a member of the LAPD after the breakdown of law and order.  Both Ronaldo and Dom have a high sense honor guided by sacrificial service as they strive to protect their family, community, and country.“Sons of War” is filled with combat action and violence as well as scenes of compassion.  It grabs the reader’s attention at the beginning when most members of the Moretti family are murdered in a cathedral and continues on to the end with enough plot twists to keep the reader fully engaged.I highly recommend “Sons of War” to anyone who wants a change of pace from the usual apocalyptic genre.  “Sons of War” will also pique the interest of folks who enjoy crime novels and military thrillers.",5,0,1582,0.101,1
304,"I was given a digital version of this book.I am not familiar with the work of  this author or illustrator, so I had no preconceived notions of what to expect.First, let me say that I was excited about the prospect of a book about exploring the outdoors.  I have done this very kind of activity with my nieces & nephews over the years.  I live  in a rural area and we have explored our family farm,  the woods, parks, and all kinds of outdoor places.  Based on these experiences, I had a certain expectation about what the book would be like.Over all, it is cute & colorful.  However, I was somewhat disappointed.  It takes approximately 1/3 of the book just to get to the outdoors.  Once there, the exploration is rather vague in some aspects  I hoped for more details and more actual exploration.  The pictures could have helped with that, but unfortunately they were much too vague and indistinct in most places.  Although fun & colorful, they missed the chance to add to the  depth and details of the storyThere was an attempt at rhythm and rhyming, but the layout of the words on the page made it challenge on certain pages to figure out where the rhyme or rhythm were supposed to be.  If you are a bit OCD, that may bother you.If you live in an urban area and your kids are new to exploring the outdoors, this is probably a good place to begin.  However, if your kids already spend a lot of time outdoors (backyards or parks), this may not add as much to their experience.Overall, not bad, but it had the potential to be  more.",4,0,1532,0.103,0
305,"This book opens with a dramatic prologue that grabbed me from the start.  Thank goodness it opens the way it does because it allowed me to prepare myself for what would happen later in the book.  I thoroughly enjoyed getting to know Naomi May and her family who were traveling to California on the Overland Trail in 1853.  Naomi stepped up to the plate and was the strong female lead that I like to read about in fiction books.  She definitely surpassed what I could have handled if I was put in similar circumstances!  Naomi is drawn to a half white, half Pawnee man named John Lowry and over time their friendship strengthens on the trail west.There are a lot of exciting parts of this book that happen in the second half of the book that I won't share without spoiling the book for others.  Needless to say, it's worth reading past the prologue to see how things work out for Naomi, her family, and John.  As a person who enjoys reading about American history, I liked learning about the men, women, and children's journey west to California.  But since this was a book that I was reading during the Covid 19 stay at home order, it wasn't a book that I could just sit and read nonstop without some mental breaks.  Unfortunately, it does have some sad parts in it which is pretty unavoidable if you're trying to read a realistic portrayal of the families who traveled west during this time period.Thanks to NetGalley and the publisher for the opportunity to read a copy of this book.  All thoughts expressed are my honest opinions of the book.",4,0,1545,0.125,0
306,"If you have read Brenda Novak books previously, I must tell you that this is not the typical romance or suspense read that you are accustomed to.  This novel is very different, in a good way.  It is the story of three sisters who discover each other through a DNA test and are seeking the truth about why they are related.  It is a story of relationships, those that are broken and may or may not be able to be repaired and those that are new.  It is a story of trust, broken trust and the newly formed trust when a new relationship begins.  I must say that I was immediately immersed in the stories of Serenity, Lorelei and Reagan.  I enjoyed the way that each sister was given her own point of view during the story.  I think I got to know them better that way, so it made the whole book much more appealing to me.  I was able to identify with each sister in some special way, based on events in their lives, but Lorelei was very special to me.  I think that fans of Brenda Novak will thoroughly enjoy this book, and I highly recommend to new readers who are fans of women’s fiction.  This book has something for everyone, including romance and a mystery!DisclaimerDisclosure of Material Connection:  I received a complimentary copy of this book from the publisher via Netgalley.  I was not required to write a positive review.

307,"The first thing I noticed (and hated) about this book is the cloth cover.  Touch it with fingers even the slightest bit wet or greasy (as in a kitchen) and it will soon look like the dog's dinner.  If I'd seen this in person and known it was cloth, I would have opted for the Kindle version (if there was one).The other issue is there are still images of Downton scenes and set images throughout.  We've seen the series so one of these would have been okay, and the remaining images left to the food.  (An image of pots in the Downton kitchen is atmosphere, but most cooks would have preferred another recipe with an image of what it was they were making -- some have images, many don't.)The tea sandwiches section is exactly four tea sandwiches and pretty much the most common.  You can get these on the Net for free.  They consist of Cucumber, Deviled Egg and Cress, Smoked Salmon and Dill, and Roast Beef and Chive.  That's it.  These are pretty much standard and in most any other tea book you have already (or article about tea sandwiches found for free on the Net).  The Deviled Egg and Cress may be called Egg Mayonnaise in the UK cookbooks or Egg Salad sandwiches in the United States, but they're all pretty much the same exact thing.The English Cream Scones recipe on page 21 shows clotted cream but doesn't mention it.  It's easy to make.  Look for a recipe on the Net or YouTube such as that of Chef John.  Use heavy cream that doesn't say Ultra Pasteurized (I use Clover brand here in California) and bake in a Pyrex dish at 180 F in the oven for 12 hours, allow to cool on the counter for an hour, then refrigerate overnight or until chilled completely, then separate the clotted cream (on top) from the liquid below, and that's clotted cream.  (You can use the liquid in your scones recipe or another baking recipe in place of milk, if you like.)  If you have a British import grocery you can also find it ready-made in a jar, but I've never tried any of those.In the Preserves section there's a recipe for ""Mock Clotted Cream"" and some preserves such as ""Quick Strawberry Jam,"" but I didn't notice this mentioned in the English Cream Scones section well ahead of it.I expect Mrs. Patmore made her own preserves (strawberry being the most common for scones at cream tea), but there's no traditional recipe for that either, just this quick version.  (Personally I'm happy with store-bought Smucker's strawberry even though I make my own clotted cream.)Surprisingly there's a recipe for Caneles, and it says you can make them in ""muffin cups,"" but no mention of the classic Canele mould or the process for using them.  A true canele mould such as the copper canele moulds from Mauviel are over $25 each and then there's a waxing process for using them.  Caneles can also be made in a silicone mould but won't develop the classic/cherished crispy exterior and pudding-like interior that makes them worth the trouble.Little highlights of tea etiquette appear here and there highlighted throughout the book.Overall there's a lot of value in this book and the completely impractical (for a cookbook) cloth cover is a real shame.",3,0,3137,0.093,1

309,"This is one of my very favorite series and the newest installment definitely did not disappoint.  In fact I read it in less than 24 hours because the writing just sucks you and is so easy that you don't even realize how much you've read._I love this series for many reasons, but for me the humor and snark are the best parts!  There are always little pieces of side conversation within the story - to emulate Brandy, Viv, and their editor having a funny exchange while writing the book.  Brady is the main POV and she always tells the story with an attitude of almost exasperated reluctance and definite humor and sass.  Viv did get to tell a good portion of the story from her POV and even Brandy's son Jake got a chapter.  I love distinct the different POVs are and how well the authors embody these characters just from their different storytelling voices._The mystery really had me stumped and I enjoyed the role antiques played in the story.  I was very surprised by the ending and the plots that were uncovered.  I am in love with Viv's detecting style and how she uses her position as Sheriff (which I still can't wrap my head around-ha!).  The only thing that I was missing was more of Brandy's story.  Even though she is the main POV, we didn't get to see much development or get much into her head, until the ending which I LOVED!  Also, I would love love to see more romance, more sparks!_I already can't wait for the next book!  Thank you to the publishers for a Netgalley ARC; my opinions are my own.",4,0,1513,0.254,0
310,"I received a free copy of THE STOLEN LETTER (Book 5 of the Scottish Bookshop Mysteries) by Paige Shelton in exchange for an honest review.  Delaney Nichols loves her job, her boss, her coworkers, and her life at the Cracked Spine Bookstore in Edinburgh, Scotland.  One day, Delaney bumps into a stranger on the street who looks uncannily similar to Delaney.  The woman, Mary Stewart, is in search of the Cracked Spine, so Delaney is happy to direct her to the bookshop.  After spending some time at the store, Mary invites Delaney and Rose to dinner and leaves.  Once alone with Delaney, Rose informs her that the city counsel intends to demolish the shop as being structurally unsound, and there’s been little notice to the business other than the scheduling of the final vote.  Soon after their dinner with the Stewarts, Mary’s husband is murdered by car bomb.  Homicide investigators examine those attached to the Cracked Spine extremely closely because, as it turns out, the deceased was the councilman behind the move to close and demolish the bookstore.  With the bookshop, its owner, and its employees all having become Delaney’s true home, Delaney will attempt to save it by solving the murder and exposing the plot to destroy the bookstore.I liked this book.  I recommend this book to fans of the series.  I recommend the series to fans of Paige Shelton and to fans of cozy mysteries featuring murder, bookstores, and history.

Because deepening awareness is not an easy task in our world today, she makes contemplative practice accessible in various ways.  While Christine has always had a gentle way of including an invitation to the natural world in her books, live retreats and online offerings, Earth, Our Original Monastery illuminates the deep and rich relationship humanity has had with the earth since the beginning of time.Christine draws on not only her own rich spiritual and creative experience but the writings of the Saints and, aided by husband John, readings of scripture.  It is obvious that she teaches what she lives.  The reader is invited to slow down and go beyond reading to find their own experience with the Holy (One) through practice!  Don’t just read this book, stop and engage the meditations and invitations to interact with nature!For such a time as we are living now, perhaps my favorite chapter is “Earth as Original Icon” in which Christine invites us into the writings of John of the Cross and highlights the Dark Night Impasse, making space for grief and practicing lament.I have a special appreciation with the way in which, as she says, “Our work as spiritual seekers and contemplatives is to see all of creation as woven together in holiness and to live this truth.”  This book will resonate with all who see the good and beautiful earth as our partner in life.",5,0,1580,0.152,1

313,"Right off the bat the story is interesting reading about Julius’s childhood.  I was fascinated reading about his close knit family with a younger brother, older sister and loving mother.  I never knew Julius had such a bad right knee injury as a child requiring surgery to repair.  To see what he accomplished later as an adult was amazing, funny how the human body responds and adapts to adversity.  I enjoyed how Julius liked the structure and rules of basketball and the sports he played.  Reading about how Julius saw rebounding as a key to stay in a game longer made a lot of sense.  Julius also looked at rebounds as a way to handle the flow of the offense an aspect he concentrated on when he was a kid/preteen.He never comes across to me as an egomaniac wanting attention every second look at me, look at me, type of superstar.  Watching old highlights of the 76ers teams he played on, Julius played with so much finesse.  His finger roll layups were things of beauty.  Besides his monster dunking ability, Julius seemed like an around superstar player.Julius spends a lot of time talking about all 4 stages of his basketball career, playing on youth teams, recreational parks outdoors, college ball, ABA, and the NBA.  So he gives you the sum of all the parts that influenced his basketball career.I like how Julius is honest about his temptations from women out on the road.  I am sure a lot of superstars glance right over the subject in their biographies.  Skipping or withholding relationships they had while traveling on the road, but Julius tackles the subject head on.I enjoyed reading how Julius surrounded himself with smart business leaders and how he was looking to start a future career outside of basketball toward the end of his playing career.  He obviously had a very good agent who gave him sound financial advice.  He seemed to be making major money from the Coca Cola bottling company in Philadelphia.Reading about the struggles of Julius children was also really interesting, how with all the privilege the children grew up with all of his sons really struggled with addiction and temptation to get into trouble.  While his daughter seemed to be more like her dad focused on her career and moving up in the world.Towards the end when Julius talks about losing his son in a car accident it was extremely sad and tragic.  Being a father with young children myself, it really brought home how precious every minute time is with your child.I was really surprised from all Julius financial deals that he almost ended up broke because of a golf course in Georgia that was bleeding money.  But he doesn’t mention how much alimony he had to chip in when he got divorced from his wife Turq.  That alone probably set him back several millions.Overall I think the book is definitely worth reading.  It does have a few slow spots but is engaging throughout the majority of it.  I would rate the book 4 ½ stars.  It should be priced no more than $10 to $15.  I bought it at a used library book sale and thought it was a great deal.

314,"In this book author Rosie Mackinney describes her battle against her husband's compulsive use of pornography.  It contains a wealth of information for others in the same situation.  Particularly interesting is the scientific research on porn addiction.  Like other addictions, the repeated use of pornography changes the brain, making it difficult for the addict to control his or her impulses or make good decisions.  Usage and degree of violent and abusive images tend to increase, as the addiction progresses.Makinney claims that many churches and pastors, though well-meaning are ignorant about the scope of the problem.  Therefore, they often offer little or poor advice to sufferers who because of shame find it difficult to seek help.  She quotes alarming statistics about how many marriages and families are being affected adversely, and the internet, of course makes porn easier to obtain.  Education is of course a key component in fighting the problem.  She advises spouses to obey God by demanding complete honesty,  setting behavioral boundaries, seeking help for both husband and wife, finding a support group and practicing celibacy for a time as they develop true intimacy and can ""reset"" their expectations.The final chapters deal with porn addiction in women and protecting your children from pornography.

Now some of you will need to BRACE YOURSELF...In this novel Bruce's mom is from Hong Kong, which, obviously, makes him have Asian decent.  Other charters are  also diversified / modernized and it is what it is.  For me, not a super big deal since I treated it like just an actor playing a part; however, for some people that are very faithful to a characters already known and iconic identity it will be hard to take.Overall the story itself was good, but I had a hard time getting past the forced cultural changes and stereotypes, that seem to be done just to fall into the PC approved world.  It wasn't needed at all and simply could of been incorporated by making an entirely different cast of characters, that just so happened to take place at Gotham High, then sure.  Brilliant way to ""modernize"" a world that is in fact reality (we are all different, every one is a people )Had that happened then I think this would have worked so much better.

319,"I have read quite a lot about the famous OK Corral gunfight and this book is the fullest account I have seen.  It is a must read for those who want to learn the story.This account is also very readable, hard to put down, and I finished it in a couple of days.I have been to Tombstone and the OK Corral many times.  I have walked the same route the Earps and Hooliday took from Allen Street over to Fremont and down to the back lot at the OK Corral, and the descriptions in the book of that area seem entirely correct.The back lot is now walled off from Fremont so to visit the site of the gunfight one has to enter from Allen Street, but it is worth the small charge.The first impression one gets is that the fight took place in a very small space.  Wyatt Earp once drew a map of the lot showing where each person was standing when the fight began and that map is on display in the Gene Autry Museum of the West in Griffith Park.  They were very close when the shooting started.I knew that telephone service was available in Tombstone about the time of the gunfight and certainly shortly thereafter and one never sees that in movies.  It seems not to fit.  What did surprise me in this book was that during the Earp posse Vendetta Ride, the action was followed to some degree in newspapers East and West.  People could read about it as it was going on.  That, too, is a modern touch that never appears in movies.I noticed that some of the reviews here were critical of the amount of detail in the book.  I suppose that depends on taste.  I loved the abundant background information.  It filled out much of the story for me.One problem was that rather than having too many characters in this history, it didn't have quite enough.  There were simply too many interesting people in that area at that time and it had to have been hard for the author to leave some out.  One who might have been included was Dr. Goodfellow who treated the wounded and dying after the gunfight and who treated many other Tombstone gunshot victims.  He made an interesting observation that a silk handkerchief hit by a bullet would be carried into the wound without tearing and it led to his early exploration of possible bullet proof vests.  Fascinating person in his own right.Any amateur who reads about these events is going to be troubled by the question of who were the good guys here.  Some accounts portray the Earps as little better than bandits.  Others seem unsure.This history makes it clear that the Earps were the good guys and the cowboy gangs the bad guys.  Question settled.I had come to the same conclusion years ago by passing on the arguments for and against Wyatt Earp and considering the type of people who befriended and supported him, steadfastly, for many years.  In many cases they were honorable men who would have nothing to do with him if he were the scoundrel some would have him be.He wasn't church-perfect by a long shot, but he was one of the good guys.",5,0,2962,0.106,1
320,"I have wanted more of these characters since they were introduced and I was not disappointed.  Tucker and Della both had valid points for not wanting to admit their feelings, but there were times when I wanted to scream because of the way they were acting.  The horrors that Della lived through were heartbreaking and I found myself being so proud of her for coming out the other side stronger than ever.  Tucker tried to remain her friend, due in part to his friendship with her brother, as well as her past.  I found it frustrating that he put so much into the age difference, but could see his reasoning at the same time.  I loved how she ultimately went for what she wanted.  The residents at the assisted living facility where Della worked were a hoot.  The way the proposition came about and their relationship grew from friendship to way more was endearing.  When Tucker pushed her to explore her dreams it was so heartwarming, even though it broke his heart to do so.  After he finally realized he loved her, I appreciated how he confessed to her brother and her brother's reaction.  The shopping trip, rain storm and driving lessons were all a slow burn to get them where they both ultimately wanted to be.  There wasn't a moment of this book that I didn't like or enjoy.  Even the hard to read parts were great, because they let the reader understand Della more.  I highly recommend this book and can't wait for the next in the series.

321,"An amazing novel by a gifted story-teller.  This is the story of a Sin Eater.  A woman condemned to listen to the dying’s deathbed confessions and eat foods representing their sins once they pass.  All because she stole a loaf of bread.  It’s a hard life for May.  She’s a natural chatterbox, and now she is sentenced to a life practically devoid of words.  The only time she can speak is when hearing a confession.  To make matters even worse, she is treated like a social pariah.  Everyone avoids her, won’t look directly at her, and thinks they’ll burn if she touches them.  Though illiterate, May is intelligent and inquisitive, and when her fellow Sin Eater is wrongfully executed, she is determined to find out why.I was so fascinated by the concept of a Sin Eater that I had to go online and do further research.  They really did exist as recently as the late nineteenth, early twentieth century.  It’s hard to imagine why anyone would choose that occupation, let alone the horror of being forcibly made one.  May is an affecting character.  She’s clever, curious and dogged in her determination to uncover the truth.  My heart really felt for her.  The portrayal of the period is well done showing the harshness and brutality of life as well as the great divide between the classes.  It’s a moving story filled with lots of intrigue and some surprising twists.  I only wish the ending had been different.  I think it’s an excellent story.

322,"Tessa makes movies.  Not the action-packed, edge of your seat kind with Tom Cruise  on the big screen, but more like the Making a Murder docu-series a la Netflix.  She was able to get an innocent man released prison, but while she’s still more or less riding high off of that major coup,  she finds out that her mother has suddenly passed away.  This puts Tessa back in her hometown, staying in the family house, staying in her old room with her twin sister just down the hall.  As if this isn’t enough of a blow, the man Tessa was able to get free has gone out on a rampage, leaving Tessa questioning every decision she’s ever made.  When her mother’s will leaves Tessa and her sister a huge old estate they never knew about, Tessa takes the opportunity to take refuge at the old home, meeting the older sisters living in the caretakers cottage on the edge of the property in the process.  I really enjoyed this book, and I feel I’m not doing it justice in the description because there really was a lot going on, HOWEVER, the author did a fantastic job keeping the storylines clear.  Like so many books I’ve read lately, this one didn’t need the last 2 pages or so---it just pushed the story’s credibility beyond necessity.  I still thought it was a really good book, and I’ll be adding Maxwell to my list of authors to watch for going forward for sure!Special Note:  Thanks to the publisher and NetGalley for allowing me to read this ARC in exchange for an honest review.",4,0,1474,0.162,1
323,"This collection has so much to love.  I didn't love it all, no one would given that his wife published pieces from every period of his long career.  After the introduction from wife Jill there's a terrific foreward by Ta-Nehisi Coates.  David Carr gave him his first break, an internship, then his first job, and other jobs.  They became close which because of the man Carr was never stopped him from shredding Coates's work when he felt it deserved that.  I had no idea of their connection.  It was surprising and lovely to read about what a tough editor he was and how harsh he could be when someone made a mistake but that when your piece pleased him ""you felt like you hung the moon.""  (I can't help wondering whether Carr would have criticized that sentence for being cliche.)  The intelligence, the love, the talent, Coates has offered his words about Carr from a deep place and that will help those not familiar.Then we have a lot of essays.  From the beginning.  And everyone who respected him or wants to familiarize will relate to different ones.  There's a lot about his struggles with addiction, about which he'd already written a memoir (before they were everywhere).  I'm not someone who reads those memoirs.  I support every addict's recovery and people who have passed in and out of my life have gotten the best I could give, but it's a personal thing and for me a bore to read about.  It creeps into a lot of his work -- and I get that, just don't remember it doing that -- from the early interview with Tom Arnold who was a newly minted celebrity madly in love with Roseanne (remember them?) and suddenly they pivot to addiction to a short piece decades later on the death of Phillip Seymour Hoffman that almost reduces his life to his addiction.It's not pervasive because that was not his job.  Carr wrote columns and covered the media and culture and the media culture for the New York Times, New York Magazine and The Atlantic.  I read many at the time and of course these things fade with time and they're such a snapshot.  There's a lot of political stuff and pieces dealing with the corporatization and conglomeration of the publishing world, changing journalism, sands shifting under everyone's feet.  Those pieces are a stark reminder of what we've lost there and what still remains.  There aren't the column inches anymore in most magazines or papers, or the word and page counts, but we are blessed with other great writer-journalists dedicated and devoted to keeping us informed and, at least in my case, sometimes sane.  So much of it stands out and so much holds up because of anachronism or prescience or both, as is the case in his 2008 piece on Fox News.And there's this: whether he was writing about the WWF or Breaking Bad, both of which I could care less about, or his family or cat LaToya or the piece where he confessed he was part of the media's enabling of Bill Cosby, David Carr put his soul on the page in some damn fine writing.From ""That's All Folks!"" (12/17/01):""What does it mean when a corporate visionary such as AOL Time Warner CEO Gerald Levin -- a guy with a reputation for seeing over the hill -- looks into the future and decides he doesn't want to be a part of it?...In the vapor trail of September 11, concerns such as gross revenues seem, well gross.""There are others doing the same job, for better and worse. There will, of course, never be another quite like him. Great writing from a man who did it with fully engaged brain, heart and soul, a guy whose name isn't known outside certain circles but who mentored Ta-Nehisi Coates till he was too sick to, who raised two little girls alone for a while, who raised himself from a cokehead who did time in prison to a voice of reason, wisdom and wit, who shortly before his death collapsed at the New York Times.  It is only fitting to give him the last words.  These are from 2014, from the syllabus of the journalism class he taught at Boston University until his death in 2015:""If you text or email during class, I will ignore you as you ignore me.  It won't go well.""""I expect you to behave as an adult and will treat you like one.  I don't want to parent you -- I want to teach you.""""Excuses: don't make them - they won't work.  Stories are supposed to be on the page, and while a spoken-word performance might explain everything, it will excuse nothing.""and, this great man:""If you are having trouble understanding expectations or assignments or instruction, please speak up.  I care a lot about not leaving anybody behind.""",4,0,4535,0.141,1
324,"RAIN WILL COME is a smart, well crafted thriller that pits two adversaries against each other in an elaborate game of cat and mouse.  The book starts out gradually, drawing the reader into the lives of two complex characters.  Paul is a brilliant, and bitter veteran detective who doesn't play well with others.  Daniel is a vigilante killer set on ridding the world of its most despicable people.  He intends to make them suffer, like their countless victims.When Paul links a gruesome Texas murder to the torture/murder of a Chicago couple, the action heats up and from that point forward it is a nonstop thrill ride to an explosive conclusion.  I could hardly  flip the pages fast enough.The writing is really good with enough philosphical and moral dilemas to keep the reader vested in the characters and the outcome.  The killer's wife adds an air of mystery, when she asks the detective to stop her husband's murderous rampage.  Her information all checks out, but her motive for helping is questionable.  Paul's instincts tell him she is hiding something important.  He has spent years honing those instincts.This book has horrifying torture scenes that are central to the plot.  The violence is extreme and not for the faint of heart.  Sexual content is minimal and if there was bad language, i did not notice.This is an outstanding book for anyone who likes an intense thriller, crime novel, or a good cat and mouse  game between well matched rivals.Outstanding!  A high stakes game of cat and mouse between two very smart adversaries.",5,0,1544,0.148,0
325,"I enjoyed the high energy side hustle concept with multiple streams of income being necessary for financial independence.  My issue is the example liberties for example if you don't take 40K to buy a car you could invest it for (x) amount of years, when likely the buyer would be using a loan and therefore wouldn't have the 40k principal to invest for 40 yrs.  Pulling from a Roth as a strategy involves a 5 yr wait period from start of Roth and on conversion the 5 yr window starts again.  Suggesting someone could save 80 percent of their W-2 income from a job also seems sketchy - when you consider the Social Security Tax, Medicare Tax and Federal Tax (maybe State tax) alone likely puts the taxpayer higher than 20% on 100k of income.  I understand what the author is driving at, but for newbies they should consult a tax professional.  On the positive side, I think this book gets people looking for financial freedom fired up on time value of money with investing early and often.  I was a little concerned regarding sequence of return risk on pulling funds out of the market in a down market could be problematic, but atleast he did mention to be prepared to change directions (more side hustles) on the fly and monitor your money daily.  Sage advice to only pull from your investment earnings and do not touch the principal, which I feel is the definition of financial freedom (living off the fruits of one's labor - leaving the financial tree alone)",4,0,1460,0.116,1
326,"Tom Rastrelli is one of the people making sure this happens!This is a very important book.  First of all, it is brutally honest.  Mr Rastrelli details all of his sexual activity from high school through leaving the priesthood.  Second, he reveals why the Roman Catholic Church has denied priests were sexually abusing and shows it continues today.  In the past thirty years a number of survivors have written books about their clergy sexual abuse, but few or none of them have been ex-priests telling all about what goes on in seminaries and in rectories between clergy.  All this needs to be exposed, but it is not at all cheerful reading.I recommend this book because, besides the above, Tom saw a dozen counselors during the years he write about.  He shares visit by visit what he was learning about himself, his sexuality, and what is entailed to live a celibate life.  For me, the most moving pages of the book were Tom’s realization of his internalized homophobia and the first time he was able to say out loud, “I am gay.”  He details his struggle to not act on his sexual impulses.  We see him come to realize the connection between his acting out sexually and his inability to believe he is loved and lovable.  He knew he did not feel loved while the priest was sexual with him or when the priest ignored him but, finally, we hear him insist that he was abused.

327,"I found the history of schizophrenia research, and this particular family's contribution to it, very fascinating.  I really felt the pain this family went through.  What a terrible genetic heritage.  I have a son with schizophrenia and am really glad that he has benefited from all the advances in this terrible disease.  I have a few comments though.1)  Why not more discussion about the research on the atypical anti-psychotic drugs that a lot of the patients are on now, like Zyprexa, Risperdal, Seroquel, etc.  The only one discussed was Clozapine, which is different than these others.  Also is there anything new coming down the pike?  As a mom of one of these young patients (29), I am desperate to know what new drugs are coming out that have less side effects .  I hope that when my son is 50 his brain isn't fried and his body isn't ravaged by diabetes and other disease of the meds.2) The comments at the end of the book that discuss treatment with out meds and treating patients ""holistically"", just seems like a pipe dream.  When my son is psychotic he is in so much physical and mental pain that trying to treat him without meds is just ridiculous.  I guess there may be a certain segment of patients with milder symptoms this may work for, but my son is terrified of what he feels like off the drugs.

328,"I've never read anything by this author before, but as I like historical fiction I decided to give it a chance.  I also enjoy mystery novels but was disappointed on that part as I certainly can't describe this as a mystery.  The story begins with the main character at the Big Lick in Kentucky where he and others are excavating some ancient bones.  They uncover a mastodon's bones which they name an incognitum and the reader finds out that they are excavating the incognitum bones to deliver to Benjamin Franklin in London.  As things unfold we find out that the incognitum bones, the Sons of Liberty, Benjamin Franklin,  the King's Horse Guards and others are all tied together.  Friends and acquaintances of the group are murdered and the Horse Guards do everything they can to keep the incognitum getting to London.  The book is well written and keeps you interested but once the reason behind everything is explained the plot seems a little thin.  The author does a good job with the historical setting, adding in real life people like Daniel Boone, Franklin and others; places like the Great Lick, Fort Pitt, and London; and even the incognitum which in real life was discovered at the Great Lick.Finally, this is something like the 6th book in this series and while I was able to enjoy it as a standalone novel, many events and characters are referred to from previous books which leaves a first time reader a little confused.  While I enjoyed the novel I'm not sure I enjoyed it enough to buy others in this series.",3,0,1524,0.226,0
329,"I'm a high school U.S. History teacher, and during the first week of school I show my students a photograph of young men climbing on top of a smashed up Baltimore City police car, one image of the unrest that followed the death of Freddie Gray while in the custody of the Baltimore City Police Department.  I ask my students what they see in the picture; some say a riot, others an uprising.  Some see the photo as an example of young people rising up against a broken system, while other students see it as a troubling disruption of law and order.  The point of the exercise is to get students to understand that depending on their own perspectives, they might have a completely different understanding of an event in American history than someone else does.  After reading Wes Moore's ""Five Days: The Fiery Reckoning of an American City,"" I'll now add another question:  ""What DON'T you see in this picture?""  The author very successfully captures so much of what is hidden just outside of the frame of that photo: the frustration and anger of young people who have been left behind in attempts to revitalize Baltimore, the pain of family members who have lost loved ones to the pervasive violence of the city (including violence perpetrated by police), the anxiety of police officers who were tasked to control an almost impossible situation, and, most importantly, the life of Freddie Gray and the obstacles he faced long before being placed into a police van where he received a fatal injury to his spinal cord.My grandfather was a police officer in Baltimore City, and before moving to Atlanta where I now teach, I worked with young people in West Baltimore as a counselor, advocate, and tutor.  So as I watched the North Avenue CVS in Baltimore burn on television, and a young man in a gas mask take a knife to the fire hose being used to douse the flames, I had conflicted thoughts.  I knew I couldn't really understand the pain and weariness that led to this destruction of property OR the frustration of members of the police and fire departments who were attempting to end it.  In ""Five Days,"" Wes Moore opened my eyes to so much that was not captured by the CNN cameras that week.  Another reviewer of ""Five Days"" claims that the author paints the cops as villains and rioters as heroes, but, in fact, Moore provides a substantial portion of the book to the point of view of Marc Partee, a major in the Baltimore City police force.  The author doesn't celebrate the destructiveness that followed the death of Freddie Gray but rather invites us to be just as infuriated and saddened by the burdens and dashed dreams of the very poor as we might be about burning buildings.  Surely that is a message worth pondering as our country reckons with, once again, the legacy of race and criminal justice in America.

330,"As someone from a traditional Taiwanese family where food is used as the language of pretty much everything -- love, guilt, shame, pity, condolence, comfort, spite -- I have been a sad foodie for most of my life, more as an active participant than an actual creator, because my mom, as the youngest of 4 girls, didn't really cook.  She had been spoiled by her sisters and sister-in-law, so she weaponized food, and the language of eating and feeding, but cooking wasn't a duty that she enjoyed.  As the oldest of 3 girls,  I picked up that message pretty young.  Imagine my chagrin to marry into a traditional Chinese ""chef"" family, where each dumpling wrapper was loving rolled out by hand, each bowl of fresh beef noodle soup customized for individual appetites, and each sweet red bean bun shaped into hedgehogs and bunnies.  In-law relatives would shake their heads in amusement and indulgence at the ""American one"", as if that explained away my failure to cook.  Phyllis Grant's Everything is Under Control is a balm to my fears.

It has 'go to' recipes for basic, beginning blocks of pastry.  Think cookies, sable breton, meringue, pate a choux, almond cake.It also has a section for fillings.And then for finishes. (icings etc)Each 'basic recipe' has additions to make your basic desert, and then suggestions/directions to use the basic recipe for a 'showstopper' version.  Typically there are about two suggestions for getting started and show stoppers per basic recipe.So far I have only noticed one small omission.. in using the choux dough for Paris brest.. he never indicates what size of piping tip to use.. the initial direction was a plain tip.. but it obviously is a star tip used in the picture.. yes you could pipe either way.. so I nothing drastic.One thing I really love, is that it has a recipe on how to make your own nappage.  I have never seen that listed in a home baking book.. as most pastry shops just buy nappage.In short, this book will be good for beginners for its basic recipes... and also good for experienced bakers to step up their game.  The pictures of finished products are also inspiring to help with construction and decorating to produce 'wow' desserts.All in all, after a quick perusing of this book digitally, I am ordering a hard copy to add to my robust,crowded cookbook library.. and it is a welcome addition.Recommended!",5,0,1485,0.119,1

I had plenty of questions regarding this book that were left unanswered.Vesta is a 70-ish widow living alone in a secluded area with her dog, Charlie.

333,"I knew of Dave only from the Jordon Peterson Podcast, and had never even heard of The Rubin Report.  I don't usually read political books, and normally prefer health & self help, but got interested after hearing him on Mikhaila Peterson's podcast.  Although I have a degree in Political Science, I've been busy the last 25 years teaching elementary and middle school, and then mostly being a stay-at-home-mom (3 kids) for the last 14 years.  Despite my dear husband's frequent rantings, I haven't kept up with politics much, until the Kavanaugh trial jolted me up out of my slumber.  These insane politically divisive times have had me scrambling to make sense of our current events:  extreme covid over-response, scary cancel culture, and dishonest mainstream media encouraging all kinds of bedlam, destruction, and instability in America.  The spin & propaganda is obvious to me, but why so many people buy into the narrative isn't.  My daughter (14 yrs old) asked me why the mainstream media (and social media) is SO unfairly biased.  I had a hard time fully explaining it.  How did it get this bad?  What happened to the journalistic integrity of my youth?  Dave's book helped me gain a much greater understanding of how we got to the mess we're in now.  It also gives me hope that all is not lost.  Awareness, knowledge, discussion, perseverance, can all make a difference.  I looked up many of the people and ideas Dave mentioned, such as Bret Weinstein/Evergreen College, and went down quite a few rabbit holes.  I feel empowered with so much new knowledge!  I've always considered myself fiscally conservative (want limited government intervention and bureaucracy) but socially liberal (do what you want as long as it doesn't harm others).  Dave helped me to distinguish the current state of progressivism (tries to shut down opposing views by unfairly labeling as hate speech, judges people based on group membership) from classical liberalism (values free speech and individual rights).  I think many on the left don't realize their true liberal values have been usurped by the far leftists (media savvy youth & Bernie Sanders) of their party, and they would actually fit in more with the current modern day Republicans, who value freedom and self-responsibility.  This book is easy to read (very conversational) and interesting.  I didn't want to put it down, and am excited for my 20 year old son to read it next so we can discuss it.  I love that Dave encourages his readers to resist being obsessive about politics, and to stay grounded and enjoy our lives. The news & social media can take over if we're not careful, and make us miserable.  Turns out this is something of a self-help book after all!  Disregard ALL the 1 & 2 star ratings from progressive hacks that don't want their cover blown.  This book is well worth the time and money!  It'll empower you to have the meaningful discussions that are needed to get America back on track and moving forward.",5,0,2974,0.158,0
334,"NOTE: This review should have read “Verified Purchase.”  Hidden Valley Road provided a fascinating look into a family and their struggles with schizophrenia.  Kudos to the author for taking a huge amount of material and condensing it into readable form.  The book was skillfully written and well organized.  The family narrative was interwoven with a history of treatment theories.  As a former psychologist, I was prepared for biases toward one treatment or another but found the author to be reasonably objective. It was a mystery story that included the question, “Why, despite all the treatments that have been attempted for schizophrenia (some of them primitive and brutal), have we not been able to find an answer for its cause or cure?""The most prevalent treatment for schizophrenia today is the use of drugs.  One of the most important passages in the book (p. 288) sums up the success and the state of this method in no uncertain terms:“ . . . traditional psychiatry has damaged them, which it has.  I mean, there’s no question . . . just looking at them—overweight, with tremors, stuck in their habits, unable to think of anyone other than themselves—you could tell they were no closer to cured than they were when they each had their first psychotic breaks.”Of course, there will be those who claim that drugs used for schizophrenia saved their family member, but in all honesty, has that individual really been restored to optimal functioning?I was surprised that the book didn’t mention Psychiatrist Loren Mosher, former Chief of the Center for Studies of Schizophrenia with the NIMH.  He founded the Soteria Project, which was based on a social rather than medical model.  One study on the Project demonstrated promising and remarkable recovery rates.Another book that would be useful to anyone interested in resolving the question of schizophrenia is Anatomy of an Epidemic, by Robert Whitaker, which includes a substantial section on the subject of schizophrenia.Like other reviewers, I wondered about some things the book left out.  Hidden Valley Road never really addressed what kind of discipline was used for the children.  Was it too harsh, too soft, or was there none at all?  How much influence did the father have?  Don seemed to be away much of the time, leaving the burden of raising all these children to Mimi.  Furthermore, many of the family’s problems seemed not to be related to schizophrenia at all (e.g., sexual abuse, sibling bullying, suicide, etc.), which raises the question, “How did these troubles come about?”  There was not much focus on the reason Don and Mimi had so many children, other than that Don wanted 12 kids, and they were Catholic.  Pregnancies bring a lot of attention, and Mimi may have had other psychological reasons for having this many children.  The book sometimes alludes to controlling parents, but it seems to me that there was often more chaos than control with too many kids for the parents to handle.Overall, I found Hidden Valley Road to be an intriguing story about a family and their efforts to survive the effects of schizophrenia.  It was well worth reading.",4,1,3129,0.105,0

337,"I frickin' loved this book!  It started out as one thing, and there was lots of humor and comfortable situations, and then it all of a sudden got very starkly and unapologetically dark.  I was like, ""Whoa.  What?""  I was just trying to get over that scene with the old neighbor lady and the raccoon when I realized that this book was not going to go according to how I thought it was going to go.I listened to this book on Audible.com, and the narrator, Bahni Turpin, is unbelievably good!  She made all five of the book club ladies have different ""voices,"" and there was no difficulty whatsoever discerning who was speaking.  And they were all so believable!  She spoke their voices just like you would imagine the dialogue in your head.  She was awesome!  She made this book flow just like you were listening to a movie - with all the different actors speaking their lines.  I would like to give some big, big kudos to Bahni Turpin.  In the future, if I see her name listed as the narrator,  well, that makes it just more likely that I will buy that book.I have trouble doing a 'review' without a bunch of spoilers, and it is hard for me to tell you how much I liked this book, except to say that I listened to it over about four days, and I had a very hard time going  to bed at night because I wanted to just keep on listening to the story.  So this is all I'm going to say.  BUY THIS BOOK.",5,0,1394,0.131,0
338,"I am going to be completely honest in this review.  When I first started the book I thought, so....this is a business book pretending to be a novel?  Or is this a novel pretending it is a business book.  I honestly, did not get it.The first few chapters were slow to start, but this is what authors call 'character building'.  You need time to tell a backstory and get the history taken care of.  Maybe this is also 'World Building'??After I got through the first few chapters, I looked at the clock...10:07pm.  OK, enough time to read a couple chapters before bed and then I can put it down and read the rest later.  I looked at the clock again...12:35am.  Just another chapter or two.  I need to see what happens to Jake.  2:45am still going.  About 4:30 in the morning I  put it down.  I was up at 7:30 to finish the book.The lessons in this book are very direct without feeling like they are pressuring you.  YOU CAN ALWAYS DO MORE THAN YOU THINK is one of the big take-aways and it is true in this book and in life.  The second lesson I learned was to hug the ones you love a bit longer and tighter.  Life is a gift and we are made to enjoy each it and each other.Purchase this book.  Buy another copy for the senior that is about to graduate and is worried about this uncertain time.  Get a third copy for the book club.After reading this, I am seriously considering starting a THIRD WAY group in my local town.  Chris, how about it?Thanks!",5,0,1446,0.144,1
339,"I have tried Alkaline eating and had great success with it.  I had an herbal doctor tell me I was suffering from 'overacid condition' and he reccomended it, and gave me a list, and I tried it a few weeks and it worked great.  I kept with it until I started dating this guy and we went out to eat a lot and I just drifted right off it and lost the list.This does have a list in it, which I'd hoped for when i got the book, and it points to an even more comprehensive one online.  THat's really what I was wanting, but I liked getting a good explanation of the diet, and it answered some questions I had always had, like why are lemons on an alkalizing diet?I don't much care for this diet plan though.  It's not very family friendly, and these days I am cooking for men who really push themselves with construction and weight lifting and they want a lot of protein.  I can pretty much read any recipe and know if I'd like it or not, and I don't like a lot of these.  I don't like green smoothies, and a lot of these recipes remind me of ginger flavored rabbit food.  I would not ever enjoy that diet, but I did find it nice that the author includes shopping lists for people that want to follow it.  I'm just glad for the alkaline food lists, and the lists of foods to avoid and walk away from.The book is well written and easy to understand.I would especially recommend this diet to vegans and vegetarians.",4,0,1406,0.192,1

I loved every little thing about him, but nothing more than the way he treated and accepted Piper for who she was.As a construction worker, Piper doesn’t do frilly.  She especially doesn’t do marriage and babies.  Although there is a part of her that desires it, she recognizes that something inside of herself is broken and she’ll never be able to be the type of woman to find it.  What she didn’t expect was to learn that her best friend Harley has been waiting for years for her to open her eyes and see him as more than a friend.Harley recognized that fortress Piper had built around herself and he was determined to take baby steps until he could pull them all down.  With his quick wit and charming humor, it didn’t take him any time to find a place in my heart.  Add in the big burly bear of a man that loves to cuddle, and yeah, I was a goner.This is a longer read but has a very nice pace to it.  The drama is internal for Piper and familial for Harley.  Harley definitely has to do the greatest giving but when it came time for Piper to make a choice, despite the struggle, she was able to face things like an adult, with a lot of bakery items thrown in.I loved this story and everything about Harley and Piper as a couple.

Her partner, Tommy Whistler, works from home.  CeCe, their fourteen-year-old daughter loves acting and has dreams of becoming a star.  Life is not perfect, but Alexis and Tommy are happy and look forward to a lifetime together.  This vision is shattered the day that Tommy tells her that he has been diagnosed with terminal cancer and that he wants to leave Atlanta to spend his remaining months at their summer home in Destin, Florida.We learn early on about Tommy’s illness and know that this is not going to be a happy ever after ending.  But we also get to know and feel how the special people in his life respond to him and to each other.

Their relationship felt 'real'.  This wasn't just happily ever after- it included all the messiness of real life.  They felt like real people and I appreciated that.  I would love to meet any of the characters in this book and believe I would relate to and like them.-I appreciated the sensitivity of how the author handles Sloan's grief throughout the book.  Read the author's note at the end for more information about her inspiration.  It's very moving.-Tucker, the dog responsible for Sloan and Jason meeting, is wonderful.-Each chapter starts with a song title.  There is actually a Spotify list out there of all the songs.  I was too impatient to find and listen to the music as I read the book, but I would like to reread with the songs.  At a minimum, I will figure out how to at least listen to the playlist.  How cool is that?-I read an author interview- this was actually her first novel; The Friend Zone was written after this even though it was published first and takes place before this.  The author recommends you read The Friend Zone first.  That said, this will work as a standalone.

This applies to all the big things in life that we southern women were taught to never speak about, like politics and religion.

While I personally hold conservative values I dont believe in legislating everything.  I believe in free will choice, just as God does.

344,"Maybe it's not perfect in every respect but Scott's imagination of a First Encounter is so plausible that it should serve as a clear warning to humankind when (and if) we begin interstellar exploration or colonization.  Certainly, if there are other intelligent space-faring species in our galaxy, there is a distinct possibility that they may not be friendly or benevolent.  Perhaps the safest approach would be to send untraceable, unmanned probes to star systems with potential life supporting planets to recon for intelligent life prior to ever sending manned expeditions.  These probes could do preliminary exploration and determine the sophistication (and potential threat) of any sentient life and broadcast the results in numerous directions to prevent giving away Earth's direction.  The probes could also be rigged to self-destruct if tampered with which should be adequate to prevent any analysis that could derive their origin.Overall, I though First Encounter was well-written, the characters sufficiently developed, the plot reasonable, the science acceptable and the story adequately entertaining.  Scott has a vivid imagination and his plots generally tie all the details together as the story unfolds.  Understandably, the story ends leaving the reader wanting to know what happens next.  Unlike some, I thought the breaking point in the series was reasonable as It brought closure to the colonists journey and reunion with their family members.  I look forward to the next book in the series.  Keep 'em coming, Jasper.",5,0,1536,0.179,0

346,"I came across Hidden Valley Road from the NYT review, a happenstance stumbling click at the bottom of a completely unrelated article I was reading.  The description drew me in, but I was utterly unprepared for the true depths this novel plumbed.The parallel mystery/narrative of the family’s journey, especially the focus initially on Mimi’s history and trauma, contrasted with the difficult and twisting path of the entire psychotherapeutic and neurobiological professions in trying to parse schizophrenia was masterfully done.  The two pinged back and forth like a tennis match and I was drawn in completely.  It is RARE to find a non fiction book that is a page turner like this.Still more amazing, despite the sadness and frustration and sometimes frank horror various members of this family evoke with their actions and experiences, by the end you come away from the Galvins feeling moved, having grown and comprehended the trauma as their own journeys moved from bewilderment and pain to understanding.  I don’t know how Kolker managed, but to make something this foreign and gut wrenching to most of us end up as utterly sympathetic and human, even after all the abuse and death and regret?  It’s an amazing feat of writing, on top of the incredible research that obviously went into this.Hidden Valley Road is easily one of the best books I have read, in any genre, in years.  And for such a dense tome on such a weight subject, it was a shockingly fast read.  I couldn’t put it down.",5,0,1492,0.15,1

When Parker finally had a chance to rekindle their romance, trouble looming with her former bakery in NY.  Parker has to find a way to balance it all, or risk losing her business and her love.

348,"Loretta Lynn has delighted us with a wonderfully warm memoir, delivered in her trademark straightforward, down-home style, about her special, once-in-a-lifetime friendship with the larger-than-life star of the Grand Ole Opry, Patsy Cline.  Me & Patsy: Kickin’ Up Dust charts the professional and personal ups and downs of two women who joined forces to conquer the obstacles they both had to overcome in order to launch successful careers in country music.  The book is a breezy, quick read, tracing Lynn’s initial meeting with Cline in 1961, to their final day together in 1963, right before Cline tragically died in a private plane crash.  Well, maybe a little too quick.  Lynn’s narrative falls slightly short of supporting the book’s subtitle, but it still scores on several fronts: (1) Cline was a “Kennedy-esque” figure in American Pop culture, and Lynn reintroduces us to a genuine artist who was taken from us before scores of generations could be truly inspired by the full scope of Cline’s amazing talent; (2) Cline is remembered, despite her phenomenal success, as having a heart of gold, taking newcomer Lynn under her wing, rather than snubbing her as a potential competitor, and showing her the ropes; and (3) Lynn proves that despite her now-iconic status as a country music superstar, she’s still a straight-talking gal from Butcher Hollow, Kentucky who will always value her friendship with Cline over and beyond all the acclaim and wealth she’s amassed.

She tells it to her family as they come to visit her, feelings come back, and life’s choices are second-guessed.I always find it interesting when someone retells their lives story.  They are able to look back and see how choices could have been different, how the choices they made changed the lives they are living now and see how different feelings made a difference in the choices they made.  This is true of Betty.  While living an amazing life with her grandparents she wanted a different life.

351,"Ok, somehow book #1 propelled this author to my all time favorites list and book #2 has cemented her place there.  The Friend Zone was no fluke.  Abby Jimenez has an absolute cutting wit to her that carries into her writing beautifully.  She fleshes out characters in such a relatable way that even when a side character disappears for chapters on end their return is seamless because that innate essence of who they are remains, she doesn't go all sideways with them and make you want to slap her and say ""NO she would never DO that, STOP!""  No quick brushing over of the hard emotional parts of relationships and restoration, no pretending love is perfect or blind or conquers all or any other cliche thing that sounds good but doesn't feel true to life.  Abbey (I think she'd let me call her Abbey?  I'm going with it.) nails the merger of comedy and romance in a sentimental, sexy, hilarious, tear-inducing tribute to living authentic lives in the midst of horrible grief.  She doesn't shy away from deep feelings, or even deeper grief, and while some parts wrecked me every page left me begging for more.  Many more pages made me laugh than cry, and the ones that made me cry did it in a way that felt cathartic and a bit healing.  If you're on the edge take the plunge, you will not ever regret reading this book!  Bonus - reading this book will keep you safe from murder hornets, viruses, and boredom.

352,"I am pretty good at baking bread, so I am familiar with yeast baking.  I picked “Classic Cardamon Buns”on page 41, because I have heard so much about it.  I read through the recipe and looked at the photo on the previous page.  The photo on page 39 looks like the classic cardamon bun with the twists and swirls.  However, on Step 7 of the recipe, the author instructs the reader to “punch down the and shape it into 12 equal balls”.  What happened to cutting into strips, twisting, and then swirling to make a bun?  The way she instructed, it won’t even look like the picture.The other issue I have is her recipe instructions.  She gives the total amounts of the ingredients in the beginning.  In the actual instructions, she likes to divide the ingredient as she goes along.  She uses the word “remaining”.  For instance, in this recipe, you start with 4 cups of flour, then you use 1/4 cup for your roux.  In step 5, it instructs you to “stir in the remaining flour”.  I had to stop and subtract 1/4 cup from 4 cups.  Who has the time?  I measure ingredients out as I go along.The recipe “Savory Rusks with Brown Butter and Herbs” is also confusing.  In step 1, it instructs to “add the milk”.  Then the last sentence states to add “remaining milk”.  Wait, I just poured my entire milk!  I do NOT recommend this book.

353,"4-4.5🌟stars. #TheJoyOfFalling  #NetGalleyI have to admit that the New Zealand setting of the bulk of this novel first attracted me.  In fact, the gorgeous South Island scenery is a prominent element of Eva and Angela's story and totally lived up to my expectations.  It brought back some fond memories of my own brief summer visit to Wanaka, Arrowtown and Queenstown.But the heart of this story was so much more.  Suffering bereavement of a partner and learning to surmount the grief and find purpose in an altered existence drove Eva and eventually brought her closer to Angela, her  sister-in-law and fellow widow.  They began their journey from very different perspectives and, in the course of their New Zealand adventure, came together in their determination to accomplish a daunting athletic feat.  Along the way they discover new romance and agonize over the fears, rights and wrongs of moving on to a future that does not center around their dead husbands and the life interrupted by their sudden demise.  Heavy stuff, but told in a sensitive and realistic manner.I am happy that the New Zealand connection drew me to Lindsay Harrel's novel.  It was not a quick read for me, but the inspirational and transformational aspects combined with a wonderfully hopeful ending made it a great read.Thanks to publisher Thomas Nelson and NetGalley for providing a complimentary copy of the book; this is my voluntary and honest review and opinions expressed are completely my own.",4,0,1478,0.2,0

However, Dull Knife and his group were intercepted and brought to Fort Robinson in Nebraska.  Prior to this Fort Robinson was known where Chief Crazy Horse was brought captive and murdered chiefly by Little Big Man who was now working for the government.With the threat of being returned to Darlington in Oklahoma Dull Knife and his followers made a break from Fort Robinson on January 9, 1979.  Knowing they faced almost certain death either from the cold winter weather or from the bullets of the army they were determined not to return to Oklahoma.  Rations of food and water were denied prior to the escape and  the book relates the pain and suffering those that survived endured at the hands of the American army.Blame from various officers to one another for the fiasco that took place is included and guilt feeling by one officer for his part in the suffering the Cheyenne endured bothered him in future years.

I am so lucky to have found you through your YouTube channel and even more through this book.Love Without Borders is beautiful – a diamond in itself, just as Angela describes her children to be the jewels of her life.  Her story tells of the deepest valleys that faith – and fear – can lead us to.  But this 200-page snapshot of her family shows the awe-inspiriting beauty that can be found from the top of the mountains we spend our lives climbing.This book is a story of faith, and despite the fact that Angela’s has foundations in American Christianity, I believe her message can serve across the spectrum of types of spirituality – or simply serve as inspiration and encouragement to live with and through the fear we have faced, are facing, and will continue to face.  Hers is ultimately the story of learning and living with a heart of hope and love.You can tell her intimate and honest storytelling is born from love – love for her husband, her children, her faith, and the world that both hurts and heals us…and also for us, her readers, her audience.

356,"An immersive journey through the most fateful years of Blackfoot history, Beneath the Backbone of the World provides a poignant perspective on how our continent was shaped across eras, who shaped it, and why.  There is no barrier to entry for readers with limited knowledge of the subject matter; Professor Hall provides room for all with an engaging authorial voice that converts obviously deep research into an easily accessible narrative.The story surfaces through recreated moments of Blackfoot life, the bulk of which are surprisingly intimate and richly detailed given our distance from the source material—they cover both the sacred and the mundane, the profound twists of fate and the everyday glimpses into people and their motivations.  The result lands far beyond a mere thread of moments, thanks largely to the author's empathic pen and eye for how both internal and external forces exerted themselves across time.  It is a heartbreaking story, but also one of glory and dignity—a story every American ought to take some time to understand.  Unlike most treatments to which non-native Americans are usually exposed, this book animates its subjects not merely as victims of circumstance and colonization, but as willful agents of change—shapers of history, of borders, of American life.  Though I'm sure it will be incredibly valuable to scholars and students of Indian and First Nations histories, I especially recommend it for readers like me, who come into it with little background in the field.",5,0,1510,0.122,0

358,"I finished this book last night and really had to think about what I wanted to say in my review.  First, it is a work of fiction.  I had to remind myself of this fact a few times when I started reading.  It took me a little bit of time to get through the first part, Sepphoris which was about Ana, a young pistol of a girl.  I think she was 14 or 15 years old who was disliked by her mother.  Her father help feed Ana's longing to write by sneaking her papyri and, If I remember correctly, teaching her to make ink.  It was an important part of the book because this is where the footprint of her life following begins, and where she meets Jesus.This book is Ana's story and it is such a beautiful story.  One that women should read and think about and learn to identify and embrace their own longings.  As a reader, you have to remember that while some scripture is shared, the character of Jesus is before he was Son of God, King of the Jews.  This is a character imagined when he was in his early 20s and the imagined marriage to Ana.  Ana has many longings burning inside of her.  Jesus embraces and loves Ana for these longings.  Jesus has a longing burning inside of him to become a disciple of John the Immerser which Ana embraces.  It is because of this that they come to belong to each other as much as belonging to themselves.",5,0,1336,0.091,1
359,"I thoroughly enjoyed savoring the stories, overarching themes and personal experiences written by author Ashlee Eiland in Human(Kind).  I found myself reading through it deeply and slowly; allowing the themes and experiences to sink deeply into my heart.  These stories can have the power to change you if you allow yourself to consider your own narratives, experiences and story in relation to the personal narratives that were voiced with vulnerability and truth.Author Ashlee Eiland has profound questions to provoke reflection in each of us; desiring to ultimately extend radical kindness to each person in order to bring humanity back to connection with one another.Intertwined throughout is the bigger story of grace.  Grace for herself and her own story, grace extended to the reader and God’s grace for us all.You will be thrilled to partake and savor in this book!  Human(kind) has the potential to change you if you allow the author’s voice, stories, lessons and challenges to change the way you interact with your neighbor, your community and any that you have the opportunity to show human kindness to as we navigate each day forward.It will expose some ways within you that you have allowed privilege, assumptions, judgements to categorize people as “other” and will kindly challenge you to do better with grace.This is a book I have highlighted, underlined, put hearts and stars within its pages as I plan to return to it time and time again!",5,0,1456,0.166,0

361,"This was a pretty good story, focused on Elizabeth (""Bet""), who takes over as interim sheriff in a small town in Eastern WA after her father and predecessor, Earle, passes away.  She is undecided on whether she really wants to stay there and run for the office of Sheriff or go back to LA to chase her dreams there, when a murder occurs that gets her deep into secrets held by the residents of the town.I thought this was an exciting story and it gave me good imagery of the lake and the mine, which were really fascinating.  There were also a couple times where I thought something was missed or misspoken, but the author went back to it and tied up all of those loose ends as part of the story.The only thing I didn't really like is that there were SO MANY characters, some with similar names, that it just got confusing.  I found myself having to either page back to remember how characters were related to each other, or break from the story and remind myself how everyone fit together before continuing.  I think this would have been an equally effective story with less characters, and/or more thought put into similarity between names.All in all, I enjoyed this book and assume its part of a series- I expect that I will read the next one (and I'll already know all the characters by then).

So clear, so honest, so conversational, so comprehensive... full of everything you've ever wanted to know and everything you've ever wanted to understand about this intriguing new realm.As a nurse, I have never trusted anyone who has ever wanted to talk to me about trying any of this.  When I go online, I'm overwhelmed by all of the people out there trying to sell me their stuff ... so frustrating & so confusing.  I just want to understand how CBD works!A few months ago, my boyfriend had this CBD cooling gel that he got from On The Green (the CBD company for golfers) that he swore by for his sore muscles, but I was always way too afraid to try it because I was certain it was going to somehow make me high (which I cannot stand, it makes me sick as a dog).  I couldn't get it through my head that it was just CBD, and absolutely no THC whatsoever (back then I didn't even know what the difference was!).Sure enough, after 18 hours on my feet one day, I had THE most horrible cramps of all time in my feet and lower legs.  I rolled this gel all over them and in about 20 minutes my cramps were literally totally gone... and I have been a believer ever since.This is the BEST book to buy, because it is so easy to read and so easy to finally understand the science of CBD!",5,0,1344,0.118,1

When she gets there she sees her father's friend, Blake, and he shows her the beautiful library, where she finds Charlotte McAdams, who is appraising the books.  Addie offers to help, and her cousin, Kalea, arrives and agrees to help.  They find some priceless, old books, including first edition Sherlock Holmes.  They update Charlotte's computer while Charlotte is off in another room.  The next morning, when Addie arrives at Hill House, she finds the library door locked.  Blake gets a handyman to break into the room, and they find Charlotte dead, her computer missing, and the valuable books missing.  When the police arrive, it is Marc, who has been away for 3 months, and Agent Ryley Brooks from the FBI.  Addie is sure Charlotte's death and the missing books are related.  Ryley immediately decides that Addie is the culprit for both murder and theft, and she is arrested.Addie is released the next day, but is still the prime suspect.  Thus, she must solve the crime to prove she is innocent.  To do that, she puts herself into some very dangerous situations.

364,"A tender heart and a crusader for justice spirit lands young lawyer, Daniel Pitt, in a maelstrom of fire when one arson murder becomes two and an expert witness gets debunked in a spectacular way placing Daniel, and even his family and friends, in danger.  It built slowly, but when it got there the tension was breathlessly taunt in this historical mystery by a favorite author.One Fatal Flaw is the third of the Daniel Pitt series which originally spun from the Thomas and Charlotte Pitt series.  The story could standalone though it is also strongly connected to what comes before both in the series and the previous series.One Fatal Flaw is set in 1911 when England is in the last years of the Edwardian Era and seeing great advancements in the sciences specifically forensic science.  This latest Daniel Pitt tackles arson.  Daniel is a young, intelligent, and hardworking, but he can lead with his heart which lands him and his friends into all sorts of trouble including this latest case about poor warehouse gang members.  Daniel is a junior at Marcus fford Croft’s law firm and meant to assist Kittering, a promising trial lawyer.  I have to laugh each time because the senior Kittering ends up being dragged into troublesome underdog cases by Daniel each time.  Daniel does the investigating and Kittering does the trials and Miriam fford Croft and Dr. Ottershaw act as the forensics team for the firm.  Love seeing them all working together on these intense cases.The previous books focused mostly on Daniel, but this one split the narration between Daniel and Miriam.  This is because Miriam was at the heart of the story.  She is a woman interested in forensic science which is a career closed to her just as she studied at university and took all the classes, but could not have the actual degree.  For the sake of justice and her friendship with Daniel (which I keep thinking is slowly turning into something more- very slowly, but there), she goes to a person from her past, sacrificing pride to ask one of her old professors now a famous and brilliant forensic expert to examine the evidence to see if there is anything to get Daniel’s client off.  Miriam faces her inner demons in this one just as Daniel gets a bit more of his naïve newbie shine wiped away when he makes mistakes and learns a lesson about reading people and their motives.The author writes her characters, their situations, the historical backdrop and social history so articulately and brilliantly.  There are layers of development that immerse the reader in the people and their story so it’s not just a historical mystery.  This one does have some disjointed places and got off to a slower start, but that didn’t stop me from engaging completely with the story once it got rolling.Like earlier books by the author, I can highly recommend this one/series to historical mystery fans.",4,0,2870,0.14,0

So of COURSE I wanted Jeffrey's cookbook (love his videos) as soon as I heard it was out!  I downloaded the sample onto my Fire tablet and loved everything I saw about it.  But hmmm, which should I get, the Kindle version or the book???  I didn't want to wait several days for a book to arrive and then have to choose, so I went online and ordered it from my local mall's national chain bookstore so I could pounce on it immediately.  I gleefully brought it home and then discovered a couple of challenges for these post-cataract surgery eyes:  First, the photos in the print book are mostly very small.  On the Kindle Fire, they generally fill up a full screen - wonderful!  Second, I have to find my cheater glasses to read the print (a bit too small and too light) in the print version, whereas in the Kindle version, I can read it well with little or no squinting.  It's a bit more work searching on the Kindle than picking up the book and flipping to the table of contents or index.  But the print version went back to the store and I'm busily putting electronic bookmarks on lots of super yummy sounding possibilities for the near future.

366,"For the first time reading about America’s early days, I felt stymied by not having read the other books in this series.  Duncan McCallum, the protagonist, never really became clear to me - and, if the characteristics attributed to Daniel Boone in this novel are accurate, I no longer have much reason to admire him.The descriptions of the times rang true - the colonies were growing increasingly restive under the crushing laws and tariffs imposed by England’s king.  The Sons of Liberty was formed as a beginning of the  movement to obtain freedom and independence from England.And, the novel opened with Duncan McCallum in a Kentucky wilderness, digging out fossils in preparation for delivering them to Benjamin Franklin.  Franklin was in England, where he served as an American representative.  Why did Franklin want the fossils (gigantic dinosaur bones)?  I kept reading to find out, as it seemed like a real stretch that these fossils would do anything to improve the relationship between England and the colonies.I have to admit that I gave up. 414 pages of small print, made it a tough slog.There is no doubt that the author spent limitless time in researching this work of historical fiction - and it is also well-written in an easy writing style.  For me, there was just too much that needed to be explained along the way.For those who have read the series, no doubt this novel will fall neatly into line for you and you will enjoy it.",3,0,1446,0.148,0

But one person she can’t say no to is her partner/friend, good-looking Major Seb Marshall.  He hired her several years ago to be his digital PA, but their professional relationship has evolved into a close friendship as they chat online together just about every day.

368,"This is an Amos Decker and a Will Robie book and I expected a fast-paced suspense that would have me on the edge of my seat.  Unfortunately, I was disappointed.  Maybe it was the setting, in North Dakota, where nothing much happens.  Maybe it was the whole idea of a cover-up and a plot by foreign agents that was kind of ho-hum to me.  I’m not sure what made me lose interest in the book since I normally really enjoy David Baldacci books and have read all of them.  Nevertheless, I did not consider this a great book.  It was okay.  I must say that I was disappointed that the author decided to bend to the will of the  vocal minority and feature a gay couple in this book, so I can’t recommend it as a wholesome mystery to my friends.  I look forward to Baldacci’s next book, but this is not one that kept my interest.  Too much was happening in the book  so that even Decker with his brilliant mind was having difficulty figuring things out.  The main plot was one of some kind of conspiracy at an old military base in North Dakota.  The sub-plot was two men competing to be top dog in the town.

370,"I received a free copy of THIS MAGIC MARMOT (Book 5 of the Abracadabra Mysteries) by Sharon Pape in exchange for an honest review.  Kailyn Wilde is a witch and the owner of the Abracadabra potion shop; she’s also facing her ten-year high school reunion.  Kailyn’s happy to reconnect with her childhood friends, but she’s nervous about encountering the still-grieving girlfriend of Kailyn’s best friend Scott, who died tragically on prom night.  When one of Kailyn’s childhood friends is murdered at the class reunion, when Scott’s ghost begins appearing to her classmates, and when several of Kailyn’s other classmates are affected by horrific incidents, it’s clear that Kailyn must find out, not only who was behind Scott’s death, but also who’s hunting Kailyn’s graduating class.  The hunt for a familiar by the time-traveling wizard being hosted by Kailyn’s family adds some levity to the otherwise serious goings-on in New Camel, New York.This book was very entertaining.  I haven’t read the prior books in the series, but I had no problems connecting to the characters or keeping the storyline straight.  The introduction of each character was organic/fluid without any in-depth discussion of or spoilers for prior stories.

371,"I thoroughly enjoyed the first two books and looked forward to the highly anticipated third, and final, installment.  What a let down!  According to the author's own acknowledgement, he squeezed this book in just prior to his publisher's deadline.  And the book reflects that.As another reviewer noted, the author overuses narrative exposition.  There were points in the book where I wondered if I would ever see any dialog again!  Many of the pertinent points in the exposition could have been handled through dialog.  But understandably, dialog takes time to structure.  Maybe the rushed submission of the book had something to do with this?I found the ending generic, expected and uninspired.  As I was reading, I was routing for any ending, but the one I received.  In addition, the story-line of a certain ""distant planet"" felt completely forgotten about, only to be quickly summarized in the end (no pun intended) pages.If there is any upside, where there is dialog, some of the banter from my favorite ""foul-mouthed"" character is entertaining.  But is it worth the price of the book?  I would say no.So what was is the author's excuse to his rushed book?  He was distracted by the the 2019 politic news cycle.  Really?  And, then makes some political commentary about voting.  A message to the author: I purchased your novel to be entertained, not to coached on politics.

I loved  the city then, but when I visit now, I am saddened by the changes tech has wrought.  In fact now, even if I could afford it, I think it would be too depressing to return to.As for the story of the author's hippy parents, on the edge lifestyle, pot business...while fascinated, I also found it very depressing.  What a way to live, raise a kid!  But she seems to have turned out okay, so who am I to judge?  I admit, I've never understood the infatuation with drugs and have always looked down on those who make it such a big part of their lives.  So wasteful.  One need look no further than the author's parents.  Both students at great universities at one time so they must have had something going for them.

373,"I decided to buy this book even after reading the reviews (some unfavorable) because I saw the author on Kristen Miglore's video featuring the author's recipe Jammy Tomato Anchovy Sauce (Kristen at Food52).  The book is divided between the ""memoir"" and then separately, the ""recipes"" which follow.  I really had a hard time following parts of the book, because of its fragmented flow.  For example,  I had to read the section about her daughter's birth more than once because I initially thought a description of the author's emotional state regarding screaming babies meant that her daughter died sometime after birth.  Some of the sections are brutally honest and emotionally draining, especially her difficulties regarding the births of her children, her miscarriages and her decision not to have more children.  I admire that the author was willing to share so much about her life.  I agree with other reviews that the book seemed short, and I would have like more detail about earlier experiences, especially in the restaurants, dating and her husband, which were sometimes covered by a single sentence or a short blurb.  I read the book in a single sitting and I will be trying some of the recipes.

It consists of six novellas, mostly loosely connected to one another by characters or location; or to previous Winslow work.“Broken” involves Jimmy McNabb, a New Orleans cop, drug dealers, family & revenge/justice.  It’s reminiscent of Winslow’s powerful novel “The Force” set in NYC.Crime 101 shows the danger of changing your pattern with a memorable new Winslow “hero” – San Diego Police Lt. “Lou” Lubesnick, who turns up in a later story.“San Diego Zoo” is a tribute to Elmore Leonard, and it perfectly captures that great author’s blend of comic absurdity and a pulsing mystery plot.“Sunset” is riotous blend of SoCal surf culture and Duke Kasmajian’s attempt to catch a bail bond skip before his business closes.“Paradise” is a clash between local Kauai drug dealers and haoles who want to grow marijuana in the land of Puff the Magic Dragon, with a soupcon of surfing again thrown into the mix.Finally, the “Last Ride” returns to the familiar territory of Winslow’s absolutely terrific trilogy of Mexican cartels, the DEA and immigration, smack into the trail of his book “The Border.”Every story is right in Winslow’s wheelhouse, covering worlds and issues that he knows inside and out, to readers’ great benefit.

377,"During Doc's extraordinary ABA career, he was quite simply the most exciting, innovative, boundary-stretching athlete that I've ever seen perform in any sport.  (In the NBA, he was merely a superstar, one of the top 12 of all time.)This is a surprisingly well written book; thoughtful, philosophical, genuine and largely honest (though Doc does plainly hedge about a few things in later life).  No so much a tell-all basketball gossip book as an description of one remarkable American's rise to great fame and his earnest struggle to balance the good and bad his life presented - not always as successfully as he might have liked, as he readily concedes.As a great fan of the 2-time ABA Champion NY Nets, it did leave me convinced that Doc would have been better served (both in '76-'77 and for posterity) by putting off the salary concerns that forced his ""trade"" to the (then talent-laden but utterly dysfunctional) Sixers, and instead entering the NBA with the title-winning '76 Nets intact.  I suspect the latter would have brought him far more satisfaction (and titles) in the world's biggest media market (and his hometown), given him the freedom to continue in his own remarkable style (rather than conforming it to convention and the multi-star Sixers' needs), and would surely have delighted his fans even more.All told, a surprisingly substantial autobiography of a remarkable innovator, even if it does leave one wishing things had turned out somewhat differently.",4,0,1475,0.255,1

Using ten questions, Maxwell guides you through the process of thinking about the content of your dream, the course in which you should maneuver, and the characteristics needed to make the dream reality.But it's more than just about your dreams, but about how those dreams can change you and the world around you.If you have the time, you can easily read through the entire book in one sitting--at least a few hours worth, though.  I did it in the course of a couple of days because I needed some time to process through some of the helpful questions that were asked at the end of each chapter.  Each chapter essentially builds upon each other, but can be easily referenced for closer reading at the later time.

It is a LOVELY book in so many ways and it doesn't matter how long you've been a herbalist, there is always something new you can learn or be refreshed about.First, the quality of the book.  The spine, the paper cover and the pages are of excellent quality.  None of that flimsy stuff!  This is a book meant to keep for a lifetime or at least until you outgrow it and pass it on to another .The sections/chapters are broken down into a very consciously thought out format. 1.  Creating Your Foundation2.  Spring  3.  Early Summer, and so on with great chapters in each category on a nice array of herbals great for the beginner or intermediate herbalist.Particular plant info is broken down staring with amazing drawings and photographs to help you identify plants, then on to things like ""How to Identify"", ""Ecological Connections"", ""Medicinal Properties and Energetics"" and so on.Detail to proper use of grammar and language (English) are apparent, then ending each herbal profile with a couple of herbal recipes as medicine or food.This is just a taste of what is to come your way.  BUY THIS BOOK.  It will become a cherished  addition to any herbal library.  Rosalee and Emily, BRAVO and thank you!",5,0,1378,0.161,1
382,"This is the first book I've read by this author and I am really excited to be able to add her to my list of historical fiction authors to follow!  I am a fan of historical fiction and this one was so engaging and interesting to me.  The 1940's setting in Paris during WWII was the perfect backdrop for this book.All three of the main characters (Kat, Barrett and Ellie) in this book were so interesting.  It was a pleasure getting to know them and understand their fears and dreams and see how those motivated their actions.  They were all layered and human, making mistakes, making sacrifices and showing courage.  Trust didn't come easily for any of them yet they all desired it.  Trust and love.  Which leads me to the growing romance between Kat and Barrett.  Mmmm, yum.  I loved it.  The attraction, the chemistry, the kissing.  Yup, it was nicely done.Once I got into this book I had a hard time putting it down.  It had an excellent balance of intense situations and emotional moments.  The plot moved forward at a good pace and I was fully invested in it.  I was surprised a few times with the twists the plot took which is always a good thing!  I loved this story!Content:  violence, peril, kissing, mention of affairs and mistresses (with no details)- I received a complimentary copy of this book.  All opinions expressed are my own.",5,0,1343,0.3,0
383,"During her first season, Lady Violet Grey met and was caught up in a whirlwind romance with Lord James Audley.  A true love match, they were hastily married, but after a year of wedded bliss, they had one fight that brought their relationship to an apparent halt.Four years later, they barely speak to each other and, after what could be construed as a simple misunderstanding for other people, they’ll embark on a game of deceit and manipulation that will either bear a winner or kill them both.Unconventional as she is, Violet won’t take her husband’s indifference without a putting up a proverbial fight and the very proper James will not allow his wife to manipulate him further.  With the complicity of their extremely meddling friends, these two will also involve an actor and other people in the play of their discombobulated relationship just to get on each other’s nerves.As soon as I read the blurb I knew I had to read this story.  I Love Lucy meets War of the Roses in this fun and romantic tale.  I found myself laughing out loud more times that I expected while I fell in love with the stubborn couple.The writing was fluent and extremely creative, though I found the book a tad long for my taste.  Still, it was a witty and charming read about two people in love who fight for their relationship in the most unconventional way.3.75 stars",4,0,1352,0.221,0
384,"This well-written novel is really three stories in one, with each one growing out of the previous one.  It is set in London in 1910.  Daniel Pitt is a young (25 years old) lawyer.  He is approached by a seemingly naive young woman, Jessie Beale, to defend her boyfriend, Rob Adwell when he is accused of the murder of a rival gang member.  Believing her, he enlists the aid of Miriam fford Croft, daughter of the senior lawyer at his firm and a budding scientist frustrated by the treatment of women in the early 20th century.  She enlists the aid of her former teacher and now renowned forensic scientist Sir Barnaby Saltram, to testify as to the cause of death in the first case.  Adwell is acquitted which leads to the second case, eerily similar to the first.  Pitt and Croft and their associates begin to see some anomalies which brings their original conclusions into question.  And the the final third of the book is about redemption, with a little bit of vengeance.  This is the third book in Perry’s Daniel Pitt series.  Daniel is the son of Carolyn and Thomas Pitt, the protagonists in an earlier series by Perry.  There is plenty of tension in this mystery.  And it has peaked my interest to read some of Perry’s earlier novels.  My thanks to Ballantine Books and NetGalley for the opportunity to review the ARC of this novel.",4,0,1337,0.074,0

It was nice to see the very similar recipes in this book when compared to the recipes given to me from family members.  The results of these recipes and instructions have been spot-on so far for the items I've attempted.When you follow the author on her blog or Instagram, her photos are amazing and very much lend to the appeal of her recipes.  I am one of those bakers/cooks who is very influenced by pictures.  So I was disappointed to find only a few pictures throughout the book.  Please please PLEASE in future versions of this book, include pictures for most items in the book!Her lefse recipe is spot on and she describes how to make it very nicely.  I was intimidated to do lefse by myself for a very long time.  It can be daunting, but she breaks it down very well.Her book covers: The Art and Heart of Scandinavian Baking, Breads and Other Savory Bakes, Coffee Breads and Pastries, Cakes, CookiesScandinavian cooking really covers the countries of Norway, Denmark and Sweden, and each recipe shows the origin country/countries, which is really fun.The author's Crispy Farmer Cookies are similar to a Norwegian cookie called Bruna Kakor which we make all the time.  This version with the almond extract and chopped almonds is really yummy.I look forward to making more of these treats for my family.",4,0,1426,0.068,0
386,"i read somewhere that one of the greatest philosophers in history who was also jewish responded to a question of how he was able to write such a brilliant work and Spinoza replied that it was the Torah that sharpened his mind to a razor's edge (Spinoza was THE jewish prodigy in the Amsterdam synagogue in the 1640's and astounded the rabbi's with his genius) and its also interesting to note Einstein loved Spinoza's rational acumen more than all the other rational philosophers combined and the common motivating thread between spinoza and Prager is coalesced in Prager' work where he condition's the solution's to the greatest intellectual puzzle's on the absolute existence of a supreme intelligence which  BECAUSE of this very condition becomes a relentless search for truth no matter where it may take you despite the intellectual indulging short cuts so many other 'thinkers' take especially these days-as Prager's example of the Torah's advanced insights regarding the law of disobedient children and the intriguing results in jewish history where there is NO instance where this ultimate punishment was carried out- that in itself seems unprecedented in ancient or modern history - Dennis Prager beautifully follows  this thread throughout his work which immediately captured my attention and the added benefit is it raises my level of joy- rarely these days does any writing accomplish both like ""The Rational Bible"" does!",5,0,1432,0.226,0
387,"I have been waiting to read this book since I first heard about it and I can tell you it was well worth the wait.  The Lost Lieutenant had me engaged from beginning to end with the delightful characters and the charming storyline.  Well, there is one character who is not all that delightful, in fact he is a horrible person but important to the storyline.  After meeting Evan, I forgot all about the annoying character although he pops up throughout the book.I enjoy a marriage of convenience and I especially enjoyed the one between Evan and Diana, mainly because I wanted to see her settled and away from her threatening and evil father.  Of course, since this is regency at it’s finest there must be an overbearing parent.  Enough about the villain though, let me tell you about Evan, he is kind and caring, just what Diana needs after living with her father and keeping a family secret, it was time for her to have a happy and peaceful existence.  I loved how their relationship grew and how they shared their past experiences.Overall, I though this novel was fantastic.

388,"No Ordinary Dog is an up close and personal story that follows the life of Will, a young man who knew he was destined to be a Navy Seal and Cairo, an extraordinary military working dog who saved Will's life.  We follow Will through basic training, getting picked for Seal training, the different phases of BUD/S, the friendships, and the mental and physical exhaustion he experiences daily.  As he moves through training, Will is introduced to the military working dog program, and gets to see up close how amazing these dogs are.Cairo and Will become partners and work side by side on many missions, which further strengthens the bond that these two have.  In 2011, Will and Cairo become a part of Operation Neptune Spear, which resulted in the successful elimination of bin Laden.As time goes on, we see Will and Cairo work together and save each others lives again and again.  While we get an in depth look into both human and dog military life, this book also shows the incredible bond that can develop between a man and his dog.Reading this book was an emotional rollercoaster, and I often found myself feeling several emotions at once.  It was interesting to learn more about the Seal team process and how amazing military working dogs are.

Are you willing to do anything to make that dream a reality?In Put Your Dream to the Test: 10 Questions that Will Help You See It and Seize It, John Maxwell identifies ten questions you need to ask yourself, and answer ""yes"" to, in order to see your dream through to fruition.  Asking questions like, ""Do I clearly see my dream?"" and ""Do I have a strategy to reach my dream?"", among others, Maxwell gives us the tools needed to help make our dreams come true.While John Maxwell has included a lot of great leadership material here, much of it can be found in many of his other books.  That said, it is still helpful to have good material refreshed in my mind occasionally.  Maxwell has done just that with Put Your Dream To The Test.Put Your Dream to the Test: 10 Questions that Will Help You See It and Seize It gave me some great ideas and encouraged me to examine my passions.

390,"I have read nearly all of Baldacci's books and truly love his Amos Decker character.  Baldacci created a fascinating hero in Decker.  Unfortunately, most of what makes him riveting was not present in this book.  Decker seems to be dissolving into an ordinary man just like everyone else.  He still has his keen sense of problem solving but I kept looking for evidence of what makes Decker stand out from all the rest...and it is no longer there.  Sad.  And I don't know what it is about Jamison but she annoys me.  Always has.There were at least three plots going on at the same time, which is the norm for Baldacci.  The prisoners angle was sort of lame.  The biochemical weapons angle was interesting.  The love/greed angle was complicated.  One of the biggest and best surprises of the book was the appearance of Robie and Reel.  It was like the merging of two of my favorite Baldacci worlds!  I wonder if those worlds will continue to mingle in the future.  I kinda hope so.I had a hard time putting this book down as Baldacci is such a smooth writer.  He makes even the mundane sound exciting.  I enjoyed the book very much but I gave it four stars because of the disappointment in Amos Decker's character.

391,"This work of historical fiction comes at a time in our country where we are struggling with a pandemic and long-endured racism--and it, too, depicts the impact of pandemic and racism in a small, Southern town in 1918 Georgia, with World War I also concurrent.  This is a read which calls for our participation.  Camille N. Wright, an author who evidences her attention to historical accuracy and passion for equality, draws us as readers into a world so well described that we feel alive and present in it.  One feels with Anne Aletha what it's like to hear that a male is more entitled to real estate ownership than a female; what it's like to set intentions to rightfully include People of Color in education and property ownership and then be shunned by one's town community; what it's like to feel unsupported by town community while standing up to others who are racist; what it's like as a female to have no right to vote.  One can also feel with Anne Aletha her responses to what makes us human: what it's like to reposition oneself to get a good night's sleep, looking for a cool spot on the mattress on a hot summer night; to delight in the antics of a beloved pet or a creature in nature (nature's flora and fauna are prominent characters in this work); to feel the visceral response to someone attractive; to self-question and worry; to survive being a single, young, equality-minded female newcomer in an established, rural, small South Georgia town.  This is a rare glimpse into real life in the 1918 rural South, through fictional Anne Aletha's experience.  We learn that it is in this very same, everyday existence, where activism happens.  We observe it even as it jumps off the pages into our own lives.  We also see that this is only a glimpse, and that her story continues even after the book is over--just as our story continues.  Like real-life, what unfolds here may seem simple and subtle, beginning with only an idea of teaching school to all children.  Then ideas become actions, which have much larger repercussions: the KKK threatening life and livelihood not just for Anne Aletha, but for her Black friends as well; and ""polite"" racists in most of the town shunning the newcomer teacher.  We see White Privilege exposed as a systemic, institutionalized, socially-sanctioned evil: it is a theme throughout this book, as it has been a theme throughout human history; and it is a theme to be addressed most certainly now in our times.  Anne Aletha, as she partners with Nellie and Alex, show us that one can make a difference in the little things: supporting each other, not giving up hope, and acting in kindness and love.  Wright challenges our belief systems with all of her characters, and we witness how those beliefs and values may clash.  We begin wondering about our own pasts: back to our own ancestors in 1918, and those even before that, who handed down family values to their children, and then to their children, all the way to us in this current moment.  For this reader and perhaps others, these handed-down beliefs and behaviors have included racism.  For some, it could be so ingrained that there is no awareness of racist thoughts and behaviors at all.  Can Anne Aletha help us to see what this looks like, see it perhaps in ourselves, maybe motivate us to change, if we open to this book's offering?  Wright sometimes falls back on the Greek philosophers, such as when Anne Aletha has philosophical discussions with her uncle.  What is true and good in a society never grows old as a topic, and it surely applies in current times.  For us today, it is vital, as an ongoing step toward actions to promote justice, righteousness, equality, and safety for People of Color, and every gender, orientation, ability, nationality, race, belief....and including the environment itself.  The book Anne Aletha is accessible, not too long--with current-event-relevant themes, colorful descriptions of a WWI era, and an engaging story. It is well-suited for book club discussion, and includes questions to start group dialogue (or personal reflection) in the back of the book.  It is a worthy read.",5,0,4129,0.144,1
392,"Once I started reading this book I could not put it down.  It was the perfect blend of serious thought and interesting antidotes mixed in to make it an easy read.  The author used psychology and Biblical references throughout the book.  I also appreciated how Maxwell used examples of spiritual leaders and heroes in our society to prove his point.  This made the book more personal.The book starts with asking the reader if they have a dream.  Then each chapter asks a challenge question in regard to that dream.  The chapter then gives practical tips on how to determine if the answer to the question is honest.  Each chapter moves the reader deeper into understanding his own dream and how to make it a reality.While Maxwell hits hard to challenge the dreamer to be practical he also gives a lot of room for hope and growth during the process.  Maxwell has a good balance between teaching reality and accepting our own strengths/talents and yet guiding the dreamer to go beyond their comfort zone to find an enriched life.The difference with this book and other ""self-help"" books I have read is that Maxwell's book offered step by step guidance that made sense.  His points were ones that anyone could follow no matter what their dream was.I received this book for free from the publishers through booksneeze.com and I was not required to write a positive review.",5,0,1366,0.199,0

394,This book addresses the very issue which has clearly prevented a two state solution and largely sabotaged the quest for peace that has been attempted by well meaning parties.  The Arab Palestinian right of return is a false right which no Refugees have ever possessed in history.  the actual refugees for the most part chose to flee premised on the belief that the invading Arab armies would destroy the newly reestablished State of Israel.  International law confers no right of return especially where the UNRWA has allowed 2nd 3rd and 4th generation Arab Palestinians to be improperly classified as refugees.  How can Israel agree to such a false claim where allowing millions of Arab Palestinians who have no real interest in living in peace beside a Jewish State over populate Israel threatening to destroy the very sovereignty and Jewish character of the country.  No Nation would agree to that and such a false and unjustified claim is something that only Jew haters would propose hoping to bring about the destruction of Israel.  The authors forcefully target a key issue which if not abandoned by a potential moderate leader of Arab Palestinians who can convince them to abandon such false aspirations will continue the conflict for decades to come.  This is a definitely a book worth reading which makes a major contribution to the debate on how to achieve a lasting peace in the region.,5,0,1397,0.154,1

A young woman is found dead by the side of a local road with no obvious signs to indicate the cause of death.  The situation is too close for comfort for Russ who was a primary suspect in a very similar death back in 1972.  Yet a third death in 1952 also strongly resembles the other two.  Russ and his police team realize their job is difficult trying to solve 3 crimes committed decades apart.  Mixed in with this is pressure from local townspeople and politicians as solving the crimes might just be the catalyst to prevent an upcoming referendum from getting passed that aims to eliminate the entire local police force and bump their duties to the state police.This is the ninth Russ Van Alstyne/Clare Fergusson mystery and I did feel like I was missing a bit of back story by not having read any of the previous books.  It took awhile for me to read - partly due to adulting, but also because it is more of a slow burn mystery rather than fast paced and the dialogue did seem to drag on at times.

401,"I used to read a lot of these multi-generational sagas back in my younger days.  Danielle Steel wasn’t my top favorite (Judith Krantz held that honor), but I did read and enjoy more than a few Steel novels during that time.  So I got a nostalgic thrill when this one came up on my NetGalley Dashboard.  One of my favorite things about these books was the Cassandra-like feeling that I, as a history buff, would have a pretty good notion of what was happening next.  You know – it’s 1912 and a character is heading on a sea-voyage?  Someone’s going down on the Titanic!  Well, when I read the first chapter and the heroine is a banker’s daughter and it’s 1928.…  I settled in for a real fun read and I wasn’t disappointed!  That said, Steel (or possibly the genre itself) is showing her age a bit.  These books used to be behemoths, with tons of flash and glitter and glamour.  This one was much, much shorter than they used to be and the characters were all more simplistic.  In this book there were Good Guys who were all smart, kind and devoted, and Bad Guys who were pretty much trash people.  Nonetheless, I enjoyed it a lot.  One doesn't read Danielle Steel for literature, one reads her for fun.  And I had a lot of fun reading this book.Thanks to NetGalley for providing an arc copy for my review.",4,0,1304,0.269,0

But I gave it only four stars as I found much of the novel lacking the energy I had become accustomed to in the first 8 novels in this series.  This was the case in about the first 3/4 of the book.  However, the ending did have a creative twist to the reasons for murders, etc., and the author left a great opening mystery to carry over into the next novel.  I enjoyed seeing where Russ and Clare's relationship had progressed and that they have a baby.  My one disappointment was that the author didn't tell readers anything about how Russ proposed marriage being the romantic that I am.  The novel simply began with the reader learning that they were married and had a baby. (but she did include the birth).  I was glad to see that Hadley Knox was still a cop in town and there are some surprises regarding her relationship with Kevin Flynn.  I appreciated the author's introduction and that she shared some events in her personal life that stopped her from writing for many years (my sincere condolences for her losses).

Gardeners will enjoy the beautiful descriptions of the flowers.  They are heirloom varieties that include roses, irises, lilies, daylilies, bleeding hearts and so much more.  We learn the meaning of each flower (the language of flowers) as well as how they were propagated and how to care for them.  Iris’s garden sounded magical (it would also send my allergies into overdrive).  I like how each chapter was titled after a different flower which was then featured.  The story alternates point-of-view between Iris and Abby.  It also goes between past (begins in 1944) and present (2003) to tell each woman’s story.  The Heirloom Garden is confusing in the beginning, but, once you get into it, it becomes easier. The pacing is gentle (not slow or fast) which suits the story.  Abby Peterson is a chemical engineer who is developing a special marine paint and was hired by a local company.  Her husband, Cory came home a different man from Iraq.  He spends his days drinking and sleeping.  Lily is a curious little girl who is quick to make Iris’s acquaintance.  Lily was a delightful addition to the story.  She added lightness and humor.  The two homes are Sears kit homes (I would love to live in one).  The author provided good information on the homes and I enjoyed the vivid word imagery.  I like how the two story lines were blended and came together for a special ending.  The Heirloom Garden is a heartening story with a cheeky child, a gorgeous garden, paint problems, a gripping grief, special seeds, a worried wife, a dispirited soldier, and marvelous memories.*I voluntarily read an advanced copy of this book.

404,"After reading The Earl Next Door, I was eager to read Gone With the Rogue to get Julia's story.Julia is a widow and is totally at the mercy of her father-in-law, who just so happens to be a duke.  It's a scenario which would have been very possible during that time when women had little control over their own lives and were sometimes at the mercy of the men in their families.  In Julia's situation, her father-in-law wasn't treating her in the kindest manner and her situation was definitely not a good one.  To complicate things further, she has a son that he wants control over.  She needs to change her situation to be able to keep her small little family intact and not lose her son - - but she needs help to do so.  At this point, the hero comes along...Garrett Stockton.  Even though he's known as a ""rogue"" in society...hence the title, he is chivalrous and respectful to Julia.  Garrett proves himself to be a kind and caring man who is capable and willing to put others before himself.The book basically deals with coming up with a plan to get Julia out from under the Duke's thumb.  Along the way, it gives her an opportunity to understand there's more to Garrett than just the rumors.  It's a very sweet story.  There were a few times it felt as if it drug a bit, but overall I enjoyed it.",4,0,1303,0.184,0
405,"The Idea-Driven Organization should be read by all managers, executives and business owners.  The authors start out stating that, “Most managers have difficulty believing that there is enough value in employee ideas to justify the effort of going after them”.  But, “some 80 percent of an organization’s potential for improvement lies in front-line ideas”.Hellooooo.  Anyone who thinks otherwise is totally off-base.  The people that know the most are on the front lines – the people doing the jobs.  They see the everyday in’s and out’s – what doesn’t work or how it could work better.I’m not bashing consultant’s (most of them anyway), but your own people have far more working knowledge.  Start there.  Great leaders make great things happen and Robinson and Schroeder show HOW to make things happen by implementing employee generated ideas.The key is in creating an environment in which employee’s feel comfortable submitting ideas.  Not just one, but multiple ideas.  This book shows you how to take off the blinders to become open to ideas.  For one, take a look at those stuffy, idea-quelling SOP’s to see what kind of impact (positively OR negatively) they’re actually making.There are so many great stories/examples from around the world, and thought provoking ideas to implement, that you’ll be ready to make drastic changes to your organization before you’re half way done reading.",5,0,1392,0.133,1
406,"Lee Emolin writes about some problems about quantum mechanics.  Scientific theories are supposed to tell us how the universe works, but quantum mechanics seem to tell us it does not know how the universe works.  Quantum mechanics can't determine if a cat is dead or alive in a strange story told as the ""Schrodinger's Cat"".What is currently true is that there are wide spread support for the traditional approach to quantum mechanics known as ""shut-up and calculate"".  As long as the formula gives correct predictions then never mind about the strange natures of a funky formula.Smolin reserves the majority of the book to describe alternative quantum theories.  Bohm's Pilot Wave theory tells of mysterious waves that guides where particles are found.  Everett's many world interpretation has the universe splitting into many alternative copies when coins get flipped.  In spite of all this, we are still waiting for a version of quantum mechanics that can tell us how the universe works.There is a second problem with quantum mechanics because it is not compatible with Einstein's General Relativity.  Smolin lays out some tentative principles for a possible merged theory based on elements found in his previous Loop Quantum Gravity research.  Since we have no experiments able to probe these merged theories, these tentative theories will be in dispute for a long time to come.",3,1,1381,0.044,1
407,"I like this cookbook for bringing something new into my kitchen:  Scandinavian recipes.  Although the recipes aren't without flaw (more on that later), author Strong brings the flavors of the region -- cinnamon, cardamon, fruit, rye -- to delicious life.  Unfortunately, like most cookbooks from Rockridge Press, Modern Scandinavian Baking contains few photos.  It says a lot that the first two recipes I tried -- Glazed Raspberry Pastry Slices with Sprinkles and Seeded Crispbread with Cherry Preserves and Cheese -- are among the few pictured.  Without photos, it's easy to skip over an otherwise delicious recipe.  Most recipes are easy and straightforward, especially since the author uses a food processor a lot.My main issue with the recipes has been the baking times.  As an avid baker myself, I know that my oven temperature is accurate, but based on my experience, I'm not sure that the author's is.  Printed baking times fall short of the actual time needed.  (My first attempt at the crispbread yielded not crisp-enough crackers, even though I baked it 5 minutes longer than recommended.)  Other than that flaw, however, the baked goods taste delicious.Yes, this cookbook needs photos, and yes, the baking times either haven't been tested or are off.  For those reasons, this cookbook will likely appeal to seasoned bakers even though most recipes are incredibly simple to prepare.-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann",4,1,1416,0.067,1
408,"I have to say this was one fun book to read, i always loved the character but never got a chance to read these stories, and see what made the so great.  This is exactly the stories that show, wolverine is not just a berserker.  I loved almost all the stories here, although i have to admit that the hulk stories were my least favorite, at least the first ones where wolverine made his first appearance, those are just kinda lame, and only really serve as the showing which comic he made his first appearance, nothing brilliant about them.You really get to see more in depth view of wolverine from his stories during the weapon x program, to his adventures in japan joined by kitty pride, and to  the adventures in madripoor.  So goes from tortured soul to tough loving sense to street wise patch where even the bad guys are hero's.My only real annoyance with the book is that almost every single issue he mentions either something about his healing factor/adamantiam body/the best at what he does, and what he does isn't nice.  At some point you just get annoyed with hearing that over and over again.  It's like ""ok i get it, can you not mention it anymore""I love that marvel is doing these omnibuses they can give you one bulk of characters history in one massive tomb, i hope they keep at it !

409,"We met this author after the publication of his second book (this is the third).  The quiet, single-minded manner with which he approached his new life as a writer, bringing to bear the same qualities that enabled him to become a Navy SEAL leader, left us with the impression that we had met a singular individual.  Like most really good writers he was first a dedicated reader, and his list of relevant books is impressive.  Whether his success is due to his own singular character or to his training and career as a SEAL ... doubtful he knows himself, by this time, but the combination has produced an author who has not his like in any other rank or genre.  This book is riveting; I read it in a one long, enthralling day, but lost my situational awareness for much longer in thinking back on what I had read.  Brutally penetrating observations on politics and historical precedents;  deep understanding and reverence for warriors of different times and countries; the strength of true comradeship, tested and proven over years and battles through danger and treachery and desperate injury; the love soldiers can come to feel for their leaders and each other, a brotherhood like no other ... they are all here.

410,"According to Rosie Makinney (and many others), porn use is rampant in society, marriages, and even among Christians.  She married someone addicted to porn and they struggled through it together, healing their marriage and going on to help many other couples.  In Fight for Love: How to Take Your Marriage Back from Porn, she offers hope for escape from the cycle of porn in marriages.  Speaking from her own experience and the experiences of many others she and her husband have counseled and met, she shows a path to healing and reconciliation.Makinney is adamant about a few things.  First of all, no matter what defense one might make of the industry or of particular genres of porn, she writes that ""there is no way that pornographic use can be considered acceptable in the eyes of God.""  Sexual immorality is roundly condemned throughout the Old and New Testaments, and Jesus leaves little question when he says that anyone who looks at a woman lustfully has committed adultery in his heart.Writing from a Christian, biblical perspective, Makinney calls on the church to own up to the issue of porn, speak openly about it, and offer paths to healing.  According to one survey she cites, ""at least 78.8 percent of all men that attend evangelical churches watch pornography. . . . Sixty-four percent of all Christian families have an acute problem with pornography.""  Yet churches, for the most part, are silent or uninvolved in leading men (and women) out of the traps of porn.  Churches have to be willing to ""publicly show the world that Christians are just as tempted by porn as they are!""  The response, though is key: to show that ""we have a great hope in Christ.""Makinney is very positive and hopeful, not condemning at all but encouraging and empathetic.  I did wonder about the disconnect between her numbers and the reality I observe in church life.  Here's my question: if a strong majority of Christians are using porn, why are churches not full of broken down marriages?  I mean, I know there are broken marriages in churches, obviously, and many couples become skilled at covering up their problems.  But if 3/4 of evangelicals are using porn, it makes me wonder if there's a continuum of users, from those whose marriages are basically unaffected and pretty healthy, to the worst cases whose marriages and lives fall apart due to porn use.  I think of a parallel to drugs and alcohol use, a continuum from the social drinker to the functional alcoholic to the addict who destroys his life with drugs and drink.  Nevertheless, whatever the degree of dysfunction that porn has introduced into a marriage, Makinney has help, and Jesus brings hope.Thanks to NetGalley and the publisher for the complimentary electronic review copy!",4,0,2745,0.115,0
411,"On the surface, Jennie Trotter might not seem like a woman who would have two men wanting to declare their interest.  She's a thirty-seven year old widow with seven children who tries to avoid men.  She knows that her Amish community will expect to marry again, but she is emotionally scarred and fears repeating past mistakes.Jennie's trauma is experienced through vivid flashbacks, as memories are triggered by the simplest of things, sending her spiraling into panic.  Trauma she doesn't realize has affected her oldest son as well, until he begins acting out.  It is in this and other life challenges that Leo and Nathan attempt to help Jennie, with varying degrees of acceptance and success.As I consider this book, it is possibly the relationships between each man and the Trotter children that endeared them to me beyond the way they treated Jennie.  Though I would wish that more of the children felt more fleshed out, the three that are were just right for this story.This was a sweetly satisfying, gently paced novel of wounded people in need of healing.  The writing sweeps you into the story and the characters hold you there.

412,"4.5🌟stars 🔌📱Spalding did a fine job confronting the current addiction to technology and social media in a light-hearted, humorous way.  After a health scare and an enlightening visit to his physician, lead character and electronic media addict Andy logs off except for his work requirements.  He pretty quickly realizes how shelving his devices improves his health and opens him up to actual experiences, and even sweet romance, rather than living through swipes and the screens of his smart phone and IPad, though it's not all smooth sailing.  The author makes a heap of thoughtful points but in an entertaining way.My favorite (LOL) scene involves a blind date set up through the local paper's personal ads;  my least favorite was Andy's interminable journey through country roads with no electronic navigation assistance.  The work road trip was just strung out too long.  But there are a number of other memorable moments that made this a relevant and touching tale.  Devotees of social media who read Logging Off may well decide to give Andy's detox, or a modified version, a try!😊This was my first time reading a Nick Spalding novel but it won't be the last.

413,"First of all, bring out the box of tissues  because you will need a bunch by the time you've absorbed the last word and closed the book.I did experience some irritations, but they had nothing to do with the writing style.  For one of them, Alexis drove me nuts!  She was so wrapped up in her job that she couldn't eke out enough moments in her work-focused life to be active in her daughter's life.  And irritation number two was Cece's snarky attitude.  Granted, she is a teenager and that's who they tend to be.  But it was still irritating to see how little respect she had for her mother.All of that was balanced out by Tommy.  His love for, and patience with, Alexis and Cece were beyond amazing.  I fell in love with him and his commitment, emotional strength, and down to earth personality.  Is there really a man like him out there?  If so, I want to meet him!Thank you to NetGalley and William Morrow Paperbacks for an ARC in exchange for my honest review.

414,"Buffalo police officer Shea O’Connor is 23 but looks younger, and she is recruited by the FBI to work undercover posing as a college student to investigate the disappearance of three young women.  She navigates life as a “student” while trying to identify suspects, remain undercover, not run afoul of her nosy landlady, and occasionally come to the rescue of a neighbor no one else bothered to help.  The story is engaging, with Shea having plenty to do and lots of avenues to follow.  Trust and betrayal are consistent themes, whether it’s Shea’s past experience with and mistrust of the agent who assigned her to the case, the students' innocent belief in Shea’s orphan story, or a budding relationship built on a lie.  The immersion in the college setting and the romantic subplot make this feel slightly like a young adult novel.  I probably would not have felt this way if Shea had spent more time interacting with her fellow officers on the police force, but her undercover status essentially forces her to be in a world populated by students and to relate to people as if she were really a teenager.  The ending is not a big surprise, but Shea’s path to the solution was enjoyable to follow.Thanks to Netgalley and Crooked Lane Books for a digital advance review copy.",4,0,1276,0.141,0
415,"Heiress for Hire is the first story in the Duke’s Heiress series, and it begins with a delightful tale full of intrigue, unexpected love, danger, suspects, and questions – some that will linger on throughout this series.  I have long enjoyed this author’s stories for her heroines are strong, established in their own right, and usually take no nonsense from anyone, including the hero – you’ll find all that and more in this series’ first release.Chase’s night and his investigation into his uncle’s unexpected beneficiary aren’t going quite as he intended – seeing as he’s been hit over the head, rendered unconscious, tied up, and set upon for some intense questioning by Minerva herself.  He is certainly surprised at the results of his break-in since he considers himself a professional at snooping around and rather intrigued by the lady who is at the top of his list of women to find who have benefited from his uncle’s will, and possibly the very woman who sent his uncle to his death.  He is equally surprised by the intelligence of the lady who has her own investigative business which can, and does, rivals his own.  Chase definitely didn’t expect to be working alongside Minerva to discover who was involved in his uncle’s death, or the very strong attraction he feels for this woman full of secrets of her own.Minerva has her own reasons for keeping Chase at arm’s length even while her attraction to this man who, unknown to him, has played a role in setting her on the path she’s taken with her life is raging out of control.  Her past won’t stay there for long, and soon she and Chase will be deeply involved in not only discovering what happened to the Duke – but falling in love and fighting for their own future as well.I enjoyed Heiress for Hire very much.  There is worldbuilding, I expect that in the first story of any series.  And we certainly have several suspects to consider, including the men in the stories to come.  If you need full closure to all mysteries in any given book, then you’ll want to know that the Duke’s death is a thread that is woven throughout the entire series – we won’t get all the answers we seek right away.I liked Minerva and Chase both together and individually.  There is a chemistry between them from the start, and I enjoyed the journey of watching them work together and fall in love along the way.  I would definitely recommend this story and I’m most definitely looking forward to the rest of the coming stories in this series.*I received an e-ARC of this novel from Kensington Books via NetGalley.

416,"The Diva Spices It Up by Krista Davis is an engaging cozy with mystery, mayhem, and murder.  It is the 13th A Domestic Diva Mystery and I believe that it can be read as a standalone.  I have only read one book many years ago, and I had no trouble following along.  Krista Davis never disappoints with her developed characters and wonderful settings.  Sophie Winston is a freelance event planner who is wore out after handling four conventions in four weeks.  She is looking forward to some downtime with her cat, Mochie and dog, Daisy.  Unfortunately, Mars Winston needs Sophie to do him a favor.  His client’s wife, Tilly Stratford’s cookbook ghostwriter quit without notice and the cookbook is due to the publisher in just a few weeks.  Sophie’s bathroom needs a remodel (tiles fall off while she is in the shower), so the generous salary would come in handy.  Sophie did not count on getting drawn into a mystery.  There is quite a bit happening in this twisty whodunit.  A welfare check finds a body in the freezer of the ghostwriter’s home, a suitcase pulled out of the river by a fisherman, two missing women, mysterious code, and another lady is beaten badly.  There are subplots going on at the same time.  Sophie spies a man doing some odd things about town.  She wonders what he is up to and is it related to the main case.  Tilly’s husband, Congressman Wesley WInthrope has had his email hacked and the contents are being bandied about social media causing an uproar.  The mysterious code was intriguing (what mystery reader does not love a cipher).  I had just watched a movie that helped me figure out that part.  The author did a wonderful job plotting out this knotty mystery.  I like how everything came together at the end.  I had a good time following the clues and arriving at a solution.  I could not wait to see if I had landed on the correct resolution. There are delectable items cooked up in between sleuthing sessions.  Sophie is a whiz in the kitchen (she should be on television, not Natasha).  There are recipes at the end including one for macaroni and cheese.  I like how well Mars and Sophie get along even though they are divorced.  I enjoyed the secondary characters like Eunice, Frannie and Nina along with the cute animals.  The Diva Spices It Up is a pleasing and puzzling cozy mystery with a missing mother, curious code, located luggage, a confusing cat collar, a stiff stuffed in a freezer, and a horrible hacker.*I voluntarily read an advanced copy of this book.

417,"Finally, a real progressive who fully understands the threat and implications of the mobster-in-chief and the “transnational crime syndicate” that put him there.  Yes, this is a bold assertion.  There are multiple books to support this - books by Wayne Barrett, David Cay Johnston, David Corn, Seth Abramson, Craig Unger, Luke Harding and others.  Hiding in Plain sight has served as a conclusion and summary of what I have learned from others, with added personal insights and original observations.  An example of this is “networked authoritarianism”, a description of our current social media ecosystem of bad actors, conspiracy theorists, bullies, true believers and others doing the bidding for the current administration.  It is far more effective than state surveillance and propaganda, and it may prove to be more dangerous, with unpaid foot soldiers doing the work of what would have to be a massive government operation in a totalitarian regime.There are more voluminous works that go into fine detail of Trumps corruption before and during his presidency, as well as the orbit of Russian mobsters, corrupt financial institutions, and bad actors from countries whose national interests aren’t always in line with peace and democracy.  These are not being read and reported enough, perhaps because the amount of detail is staggering, a dizzying array of LLC’s, dark money, shady real estate transactions – eyes can glaze over in the details.  Hiding in Plain sight highlights the corruption, avoiding mind numbing detail making the larger works incomprehensible to many, yet still presents enough to draw the same conclusions.Though written before the COVID-19 pandemic, reading it during the pandemic seemed highly relevant to today’s news.  Kendzior warns of an elite that sees tragedy as an opportunity, the world is for sale at bargain prices.  The disaster capitalism Naomi Klein warned us of is about to go into overdrive.  Trump’s incompetence at handling the pandemic serves them well.  His daily barrage of outrageous tweets and insults distract us from the larger dismantling of our political and justice systems.  His fake populism hides the dark elitism that drives this regime.Trump is a product of the U.S.A.  Years of financial mismanagement and fraud with impunity have led to his rise, enabled by a system that favors prosecuting small street crime. His gateway to the mob, his previous attorney Roy Cohn, operated between the worlds of the political establishment and the New York mafia.  Mob influence in our political systems has long been with us, but now, instead of being a primarily local phenomenon, it has gone global, transnational, and frighteningly authoritarian.  Putin learned how to weaponize it.  And now they have their man in the White House.",5,1,2786,0.057,1
418,"First, I must thank NetGalley and St. Martin’s press for providing me with an e-ARC of this astoundingly dark and brooding nightmare of a book.  This book will plunge readers into a realm of darkness and will make them yearn for a tiny shred of light, yet they will still be thankful for the harrowing, heart-rending journey.The story starts where Wicked Saints left off and illuminates the broken beings the three main characters have become.  They are all enveloped in varying degrees of darkness and are reduced to playthings of a seemingly immutable and inescapable fate.  Nadya is floundering without her gods and with the slowly dawning knowledge of her latent power.  She is lost and in need of guidance, but she cannot sever her tie or unshakable bond to the boy who betrayed her.  Malachiasz successfully fashioned himself into a monster yet must continue to smother the small amount of humanity that remains within.  He, too, cannot sever his connection to Nadya despite their incompatible beliefs and loyalties.  And finally, Serefin, the newly anointed Tranavian king, is slowly unraveling under the unrelenting influence of a pair of “lesser” gods.  He is losing himself through the incessant chatter of the gods who wish to shape their fate and is unwillingly dragged to a conclusion he regrets.  Through their journey they continue towards a dark fate, actively betraying one another in the basest of ways.  They are all pulled by their mutual goals to rectify the crumbling world around them but are divided by their stalwart adherence to their personal ideologies.  This continual conflict forms the crux of the story and provides the tension that never ceases.  The conclusion deposits the reader in a dark realm of possibilities and provides no indication of what fate awaits our battered protagonists.The writing of this book, though dark and depressing, is well-done.  The main characters are thoroughly entrenched in misery and Emily Duncan deftly plunked me right alongside them.  Ruthless Gods spins a bleak world out the fraying threads of flawed gods and humans and it is difficult to trudge through emotionally.  The story churns slowly and is infuriatingly indulgent and redundant at times, but never enough to drive me away.  I am bound to all three main characters and I hope they are able to emerge unscathed in the conclusion.  Duncan is skillful in her ability to make her characters sympathetic and manages to forge a lens that positively skews them despite committing the vilest of deeds.  The story seems to be careening towards a bleak ending that I am resolutely prepared for, but I am hoping that love can ultimately conquer all.",4,0,2668,0.104,0

As a Red Sox fan born in Pennsylvania in 1988, I was not intimately familiar with the '68 World Series and although I consider myself a baseball nut I had only a passing knowledge of what transpired that fall.I found the format of this book to be instantly engaging-- it is not a mere recitation of facts.  One of the things I was surprised by was how much I laughed while reading-- the players' recollections are laced with good humor and frequently differ, which makes the reading process all the more enjoyable, especially when the author intervenes to reveal what ""actually"" happened.  It generally feels as though the reader is sitting with the entire team as they rehash the events of that Series, maybe over a few adult beverages on the veranda at the Otesaga Hotel.  It is a lot of fun.The stories are organized such that they are easy to digest and one does not need to read this in order, front-to-back, to be able to enjoy it.

Quite honestly, I have done a lot of reading about the Holocaust, but I knew nothing about Latvia.  This was my first exposure to a Nazi hunter . . . and it was not at all what I expected.The book begins with an introduction to the main character, then moves on to a history of Latvia and the purge.  It is brutally hard to read at times, but not anywhere as brutally hard as it was to live.  The process of tracking down the Silent One (Cukur, a war criminal) and killing him . . . then the resulting impact on the politics in Germany and the world . . . it is all so engrossing I finished the book in three days.

Not much happens except to the cats and Georgie's unsuccessful abductor (not a spoiler, it's in the first chapter and on the blurb).I think if I hadn't read it during stay-at-home for COVID-19, I might not have finished it.  But given the general hideousness of the world today this was a real comfort read.  Nicholas' profession as a physician was interesting and I'm glad Georgie was able to find a way to be part of that despite the U of Edinburgh being closed to women.  I will admit to some historical confusion here since physician was not a typical option for a peer's son and Nicholas is actually acting as a surgeon which was definitely not a gentlemanly pursuit.  I handwaved it away as N being the fourth son and church/military professions already taken.There are some funny scenes especially with cats and very likable characters.  It ends rather abruptly with a brief epilogue showing Georgie being something of a physician herself which I was more interested in exploring than many of the previous events.For a time when you don't want to read anything too angsty or serious, it's a lovely, sweet story.Purchased on kindle.",3,0,1332,0.151,0
423,"This was fantastic!  It had all the elements that I loved in the author's Charley Davidson series but with a new set of characters and a whole new world that I absolutely loved.  I am so excited for this new series.  I can already tell you this will be a series I will want to re-read often.Those elements I mentioned is the snarky heroine, fun sidekicks and an incredibly intense hero.  To me it's the perfect formula to an entertaining series.  As fun and entertaining as this book was, it also had some pretty heavy material.  I can admit that I cried a couple times.  There are a few sad moments that really pulled on my heart.  It's a well rounded book with everything it provides.This author really knows how to build up the intensity for her couples.  She seems to love that delayed satisfaction and normally I would say that I want it now, but I can't deny that it's worth the wait.  The longer it takes for the couple to get together, the more the intensity builds.  I think this couple will be another explosive relationship to look forward too.If I thought it would do any good, I would beg for the next book to be published soon after A Bad Day for Sunshine.  This doesn't end on a cliffhanger but you also know there is more to come and I can't wait!",5,0,1263,0.293,1
424,"After almost 20 years together, Nina Garrity’s husband vanished one day under rather strange circumstances leaving her alone with their children.  Not able to determine whether he’s dead or alive, Nina struggles to move on, but the more questions she asks, the more it seems she didn’t know her husband at all.Barely a year and a half later, Nina is in a new relationship, moving into a new house with a new man despite her youngest child’s lack of compliance.  Simon Fitch seems to be the perfect man: loving, attentive and always guessing Nina’s needs before she has a chance to voice them.I have to say I was very attracted by the book’s blurb and wanted to find out what this story was all about, but I found myself with a rather predictable psychological thriller with a few unexpected twists.The writing was good, fast paced and the story makes for a mildly entertaining read.  I enjoyed the fact that the book was not only from Nina’s perspective, but her daughter Maggie’s as well and I have to say I liked the latter best.  The author definitely managed to capture that pesky teenage attitude quite well and the delivery makes for a great visual image, like I could see the attitude pouring out of the character as I read.Overall, I say it’s a decent read, but not high in my chart on this genre.3.5 stars*NetGalley review*",3,0,1332,0.224,1

426,"Rating:  3.5 rounded up to 4 suspenseful starsHow would you feel if your small son disappeared during a moment of inattentiveness?  This is where Jennifer Hillier’s latest book, “Little Secrets” opens.  Marin Machado let go of her small son’s hand for a moment at Seattle’s Pike Place Market.  When she looked up from her phone, he had disappeared.  CCTV cameras captured Sebastian walking to the Market’s parking garage with an unidentifiable adult.  Now fast-forward sixteen months.  We see the toll that Sebastian’s kidnapping has had on Marin.  It has affected every aspect of her life, including her marriage.She struggles to get through the day.  Only with the help of a very able manager is she able to retain her high-end salon business.  She and her husband Derek both have high-profile professions, and are high achievers.  They are well known amongst the movers and shakers in Seattle.  However, Sebastian’s kidnapping changed all that.  Now it is all Marin can do to get through the day, some days just to get to the next minute.  She and Derek hardly interact any more as he focuses on his business, and is often out of town.Then Marin discovers that Derek has been having an affair.  That seems to motivate her, or at least kick her revenge motive into high gear.  Slowly we learn that all is not as it appears on the surface, and people sometimes make uncharacteristic choices when emotions run high.  The story picks up pace, and grows more complicated as it unfolds.  Marin continues to recount the ways that Sebastian’s kidnapping still affects her every day.  Her sorrow is almost debilitating.  Not knowing his fate is almost worse for her than learning that he has died.  Almost.Surprises galore are unearthed as the books careens toward its climax.  I was satisfied with the twists at the end.  I anticipated a few, but some were true surprises.  That is the best kind of psychological thriller, or mystery.  I hesitate to give this five stars because after a while I thought the story was a bit bogged down in Marin’s navel-gazing.  Ms. Hillier did a good job at describing how I imagine a parent of a missing child might feel like.  Unfortunately, for me, the space devoted to Marin’s process slowed down the plot, and made me a bit impatient.I would recommend this for readers who enjoy a psychological thriller.  I would also categorize this as what I call a ‘domestic’ mystery.  It is a smart book, if just a tad bit heavy on the angst for me.‘Thank-You’ to NetGalley; the publisher, St Martin’s Press, Minotaur Books; and the author, Jennifer Hillier for providing a free e-ARC copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.",4,0,2657,0.116,0

428,"THE SOUTHERN BOOK CLUB'S GUIDE TO SLAYING VAMPIRESI love vampire stories and also books set in the South.  Wow, this was the perfect combo for me.  Author Grady Hendrix [where have you been all my life?] takes readers on a ride they will not soon forget.Patricia Campbell lives in Charleston and is the mother of two rather surly teens.  Her husband works long hours and is never around -- and when he is around, he doesn't pay much attention to Patty except to maybe belittle her and not take her very seriously.  Patricia also has her MIL to take care of as she is living with them and is in failing mental health.  Patricia's saving grace?  Her books and her book club friends.Things are going well as can be for Patricia...until one night something so astounding happens when Patricia is taking out the trash.  This event causes Patricia to meet her newest neighbor, the very handsome and charming James Harris.  He is the nephew of Patricia's elderly neighbor and he has come to Charleston to live with his aging aunt.  Sound sweet....?  Um, it isn't.  Things start to happen in the neighborhood and surrounding areas...kids go missing, kids are hurting themselves, things are just WRONG.There were so many things I loved about this book.  I loved the wit and humor that was apparent during the entire book.  Even when the most horrible of horrible things were happening, there was humor.  The women in the book have loyal, deep, and true friendships.  They may not agree all of the time, but they have each other's backs constantly.  Well, most of the time.  Each lady is different, each lady has a totally different home life, but they all click! and are friends.  The plot is unique and fast-paced.  The characters are so totally down-to-earth and real.  The book is so well written that I hated to stop reading.There are plenty of graphic and brutal scenes; chapter 39 especially so -- now, don't go peeking ahead, it will ruin things for you!  But this is what you get with a vampire novel.  There is plenty of manipulating, sneakiness, men not caring or believing their wife because she is a woman, a little bit of history, and plenty of things that go bump in the night.  And friendship.  And love.  And blood.I am a huge Stephen King and Robert McCammon fan and love the vampires they have created over the years.  However, the vampire Grady Hendrix has given birth to is far different from any other.This is an action packed, fun, witty, scary, creepy book.

Angie Turner and the staff of The County Seat are participating in a new challenge.  They’re competing in a themed competition against other regional restaurants at the Idaho State Fair.  During the first two rounds, the competition becomes a matter of life and death as each round’s winner is attacked.  This leaves everyone else a little relieved to fall short of the top slot for the first two rounds.  With a week of business-as-usual before the final two rounds, Angie has plenty of time to investigate the attacks.  Is the competition or something more personal motivating the bad actor?  This time local Sheriff is happy to encourage Angie’s investigation as the State Fairgrounds is out of his jurisdiction, and the investigators in charge are going to great lengths to classify the incidents as accidents.  In the meantime, several enigmatic figures enter Angie’s life.I liked this book and enjoy the series.  I recommend this book to fans of the series.

430,"'Savage Son', Book 3 in this series, does not disappoint the reader ..not even for one page.  It is a thriller and a page turner.  I would recommend buckling up your seat belt and trying to settle in for the non-stop action.James Reece, former Navy SEAL (is there really such a person as a former SEAL?), is recuperating in Montana from brain surgery.  He will make his way to the Russian Mafia where all hell breaks loose.To add to the action, there is a CIA officer who is involved with a conspiracy and the Mafia...As the reader will discover the hunters will become the hunted.Definitely a high octane thriller with action throughout.  The author has a firm grasp on human emotions and their instincts.  Having this innate ability to transfer those items to the written page makes this an 'over-the-top' read for me.  And, his background as a Navy SEAL allows the reader to trust what he has written concerning the weapons, etc.All in all, just an excellent and thrilling read for me.  From page one to the very last, it is a well developed novel, including the characters, and a multi-layered plot.  The descriptions throughout also contribute to the story as they are so vivid.Bravo Zulu to the author and with gratitude from me for his service as a USN SEAL.

431,"This is a remarkable blend of a legal thriller and a story of strong personal relationships enduring, or not, over time.  In the opening section, Clint is representing his childhood friend Nicky who has been accused of murdering his wife.  I thought this was going to be the only plot line of the book, and early on, wasn't expecting more than a standard fare did he, or didn't he, court case with a surprise at the end.  The story of the trial moves quickly though, and I realized it was wrapping up and I was only a quarter of the way into the book.  After the trial, we jump ahead many years, and Clint's wife Anne picks up the story from her perspective, including recollections of how the trial impacted everyone's lives since.  This is followed by two more sections, one narrated by Nicky, and a final narration by Clint.  I like where this book took me, again, Mitzner has created characters that are easy to connect with and make you want to read their stories.  The characters are complex, their flawed, and even the ones I like make decisions that are hard to agree with.  Although this is technically the third in a series, it's only that because of recurring characters, it's a wonderful stand-alone book.

432,"When a self-proclaimed ""underachiever"" becomes a distinguished teacher, attorney and (in his words) ""critical thinking evangelist"", you know that this author has both credibility and a wealth of information to share.  Colin Seale's book details how his thinkLaw curriculum can be used--indeed, HAS been used--by educators of every persuasion--those who teach gifted students, ELL kids, and every other kind of learner who enters our classrooms.  Believing that critical thinking is 1. the set of skills and dispositions we need 2. to learn what we need to learn 3. to solve problems across disciplines 4. that are grounded in the spirit of doing right instead of simply being right, Colin Seale adds a three-dimensional context to the ways that teachers across disciplines can weave critical thinking  strategies into their lessons.  Ever the realist, Colin Seale also includes some time-tested adjuncts to his repertoire--wait time, rubrics, fishbowling--which allow teachers to mesh his thinkLaw strategies with other teaching practices they use already...or should.  My only concern with the book is that some teachers might find the extensive reviews of actual law cases, and how to apply them in the classroom, a bit intimidating on first read.  However, once the entire thinkLaw curriculum is explained and fleshed out in latter portions of the book, any initial intimidation show fade quickly.",4,0,1400,0.048,1
433,"I jumped on the opportunity to get a pre-publication galley of Little Secrets because I'm a big fan of Jennifer Hillier.  And let me tell you, her latest novel does not disappoint.  Little Secrets is really about huge, gargantuan secrets.  Secrets between husband and wife, Marin and Derek, and others in their lives.  It starts with Marin and her son, Sebastian, doing some last minute Christmas shopping at Pike Place Market.  When Marin gets a call from Derek, mere seconds of her distraction result in their son being abducted.  The story quickly moves to 16 months in the future when Marin is a shadow of her formerly fabulous self and her marriage to Derek is dying a slow, quiet death.  Marin is still searching for her son so she hires a private detective to keep the investigation going.  While the PI is getting nowhere on the search for Sebastian, she does discover that Derek has been having an affair with a much younger woman.  And it's a roller coaster ride from there.Hillier is at her best taking the reader on a high-speed, twisty tale of suspense that will have you saying ""just let me finish one more chapter"" until the pages come to an end.  I couldn't put it down.  The characters are beautifully developed and Hillier is a fabulous storyteller.  Five bright stars.",5,0,1287,0.125,0

In short, he likes what he likes, not that there’s anything wrong with that.The day his lady friend Cass calls and informs him that she’s in danger of losing her apartment, things change in more ways than one.

Best decision she could have made because she meets Angela and her son Otis and her world opens up.  This might, if you read the promotional material, seem like something you've read before but it's not.  THere's a depth here that I appreciated as well as a strong beating heart- Morrey clearly likes her characters (and she's a great storyteller).  Missy is a Cambridge grad who married Leo, who grew into a famous biographer while she stayed home with Melanie and Alasdair.  Leo's gone now and  so are the grown children.  How she comes to reconcile with Mel (as well as the reasons for their estrangement) is so nicely done and all the secrets won't be revealed til near the end.  Angela's request that Missy foster Bob (later Bobby) the dog starts off as an imposition and turns into a love story in itself.  Missy makes a family, even though she doesn't realize it, with Otis, Angela, Sylvie, and other others and, by the time her 80th rolls around, she's in a better place.

436,"This was a domestic thriller that didn't really bring anything new to the table.  It centers around Nina, a mother of 2 whose husband Glen disappears under suspicious circumstances almost 2 years ago; since then, she has met and moved in with a new beau, Simon.  There are also some chapters told from her 13-year-old daughter Maggie's POV.I found the plot to be predictable in this one, and Nina's character to be frustratingly dense.  I also found myself annoyed with both her best friends and her therapist, who heard what she was dealing with and didn't bother to do anything to help her.  Maggie, the young daughter, made the smartest decisions in the story and seemed like the most believable character.  Nina's son, Connor, was such a bit character that I don't know why he was even part of the story.  I also found the writing to be a tad verbose- the story could have been told in less words/chapters overall with the same overall impact.Overall, this one was not for me- it just felt like a predictable story that has been told before.

441,"Let me start by saying I'm a big fan of Annabeth Albert.  She writes really awesome, strong men who fall for other men.  They is usually a lot of character depth and almost always an interesting background and of course fantastic chemistry and hot sex.This book hit most of those things but felt a little off in the character depth department or maybe I just feel that way since I just couldn't reconcile Linc's thought processes.  His best friend is seriously homophobic and we are told that he doesn't hold back and makes bad jokes and homophobic slurs even though he knows Linc is gay.  Linc feels like he owes Wyatt since he saved him by befriending him and giving him a surrogate family since Linc's was crap.  I really disliked Wyatt.  So when Wyatt's brother comes out he makes Linc promise that he'll never be with his brother, Jacob.  Now at first I can understand this if it was an age related thing since there is some years in between them and at the time Jacob is 19 and seems to be a sheltered 19.  But later we are told that Wyatt seems to somehow blame Linc for turning Jacob gay which is just so ridiculous.  But even more ridiculous is that Linc has this unfailing loyalty to Wyatt and it doesn't matter what Wyatt says/does he stands by it.  I just didn't understand the depth of why this was the case.  I needed more on why Linc felt he owed Wyatt so much especially once he realized how much he cared about Jacob and after Wyatt died.  Secondly, Linc also feels like he isn't good enough for Jacob and again we never really find out where his lack of self esteem comes from.  Of course it isn't just Wyatt who is homophobic but the rest of Jacob's family as well which is apparently another reason Linc thinks they can't be together even though Jacob admits his family will have a problem with it but doesn't care.  Jacob has a ton of self esteem and no issues even though his entire family is homophobic he doesn't seem to struggle at all with this or that his family has issues with his sexuality.Now this might seem like I didn't like the book and that isn't the case.  The connection between Jacob and Linc was amazing.  You could feel it from the opening scene throughout the book.  I also loved the smoke jumper background and found that part very interesting.

It was an interesting experience to re-encounter a book we hadn't read in at least 35 years.There were parts that we remembered as if we had read them yesterday, and other parts where we were able to examine the author's writing technique, the descriptions that were typical of the time when the book was written, and the life lessons that were presented in a very pleasant way.Because we were reading from a variety of editions, we noted that cover pictures varied from the dark haired child that most of us remembered to a presentation of a blond child.  Those individuals who had illustrations included in their books, some of which had been owned for 50+ years, happily shared them with the group, producing many more comments about clothing, the Alpine scenery, and the characters as we had imagined them.Discussing a book from our childhood is not a regular practice of the group, but for this one time, it elicited many personal comments about our memories and our admiration for the author and her technique.",5,0,1325,0.064,1

Granted, I spent many years as a social worker at a state hospital where I had the privilege of working with people diagnosed with schizophrenia.  Nevertheless, I cannot imagine anyone who has any interest in families, with or without mental health issues, who would not find this book fascinating.Other reviewers have already provided sufficient information regarding the content of this book.  To their comments I would only add that this is a journalistically driven, nonfiction book that reads as fluidly and compellingly as a novel.Although the topics of psychiatry and psychopharmacology are woven throughout the narrative, the author’s focus is always on the family.

445,"I loved reading Girl Decoded and found the many different themes explored in the book very inspiring.  First of all, this is Rana el Kaliouby’s life story, from growing up as a “nice Egyptian girl” to becoming one of few women founding and leading an Artificial Intelligence company.  As a scientist turned entrepreneur, a Muslim-American and technology thought leader, el Kaliouby is a very welcome new voice in the technology industry … an industry known to lack in diversity.  Her story is one of self-discovery and will resonate greatly with anyone who has struggled to find their voice.  Also, the book is an exploration of innovation in technology.  El Kaliouby talks about Affectiva, the company she founded, and about its mission to humanize technology.  She describes how she created artificial emotional intelligence (she calls this Emotion AI) and explores the many transformative applications of this very new technology.  I appreciate how she, very openly, describes the challenges in creating ethical technology and what she and her company are doing towards that.  I think this book will speak to both young people embarking on their careers and personal growth, as well as seasoned business leaders who might be jaded and need a fresh perspective on leadership.",5,0,1277,0.19,1
446,"As a fan of Hot Tuna and a devotee of Jorma’s solo careeer I was looking forward to the release of this book.  Yet I found the book to be hard to navigate as it went on.  There was a constant tone throughout the book concerning his relationship, or lack of relationship  with important people in his life, from his grand parents to his  parents, his first wife and his brother.  He acknowledged his brother as someone he never had a relationship with, but the others come back in his writing again and again but with little development of who they were, or how they figured into, or impacted his life.  But I couldn’t believe that Jack Casady wrote the afterword.  Jack speaks warmly of Jorma as his best friend and musical partner for 60(!) years.  Yet while Jorma takes responsibility for walking away from Jack and ending Hot Tuna in the mid 1970’s, it was just another event in his life.  I think what was missing for me was the heart and soul of Jorma.  He talks about his recovery from drugs and alcohol abuse , but there too was a lack of depth to give me some inkling about Jorma.  Lastly, the book suffers from a lack of organization and chronology, and a dose of melancholy as Jorma reviews those who are no longer with us, again and again.",3,0,1250,0.081,1

He loves his friends who are also on the line with him.  But, when tragedy strikes, Linc has to shut off all emotions in order to continue doing his job.Jacob has wanted to be a smokejumper since he was young.  Watching his older brother become one also helped secure his interest.  After his brother is lost to a large fire, despite his family's protests, Jacob isn't going to let that stand in his way of his own dreams.One of those dreams is that Linc would fall in love with him.  They had one steamy encounter, but since then, Linc has kept his distance from, not only Jacob, but Jacob's entire family.  Linc has always been around and when he pulls away, he's missed by everyone.When Jacob makes it as a smokejumper, Linc is also less than pleased.  What follows is a back and forth, push - pull relationship that seemed incredibly YA.  Linc likes to live his life in guilt and Jacob just wants people to see him for his abilities and not for what he's lost.These two, while they are great when working together, they have a forced chemistry.

Lady Julia Kitson Fairbright is the widow of the Duke of Sprogfield's youngest son.  The Duke is publicly pious and very controlling of Julia and her four year old son Chatwyn.  The Duke threatens to take Chatwyn if she fails in his demands.  Our H - Lord Garrett Stockton is a gentleman who works!  He has a profitable shipping line, and a reputation as a rake.I liked the outset of the book with Julia in a tree and Garrett coming to her rescue.  I can see how they would each become intrigued with the other.  However, the book then slows down and we repeatedly hear the Duke will take Chatwyn.  There is instalove with no real development of chemistry.  The author doesn't provide enough character development, or emotional involvement for us to care what happens to these people.  I did enjoy the scene with the two ""Ladies"" trying to make bread and soup - ""it can't be that difficult!"".

449,"Anyone who read and was enlightened by (I won't say ""enjoyed"") Kim Ghattas' ""Black Wave"" should follow it up by reading Krithika Varagur's ""The Call.""  This book zooms in only on how the Saudis have spread their brand (or at least a collateral branch) of Islam in three countries: Indonesia, Nigeria and Kosovo.  Varagur spent at least two, possibly three years writing this book and interviewed scores of people (mostly Muslim clerics and scholars) in all three countries.Varagur has almost certainly forgotten more about Islam than I ever learned.  She explains something I thought I would never understand, the real relationship between Wahhabism and Salafism (but does not rule out the possibility that the Wahhabis were simply the first Salafists).  Both were inspired by Ibn Taymiyya, who may have been the most influential Muslim thinker of the second millennium (Western calendar).From this book, we learn that the Saudi transformation of Sunni Islam and corresponding decreasing tolerance of other strands of Islam (to say nothing of other religions altogether) is a phenomenon not limited to the Middle East, even if it hasn't driven most non-Sunnis out of Indonesia and Nigeria.  The book's granular level of detail is an asset (Varagur estimates for example that there are anywhere between two and nine million Shia in Nigeria).  There is the occasional error, but only about Western governments (e.g. Bruce Riedel gave national security advice to four Presidents, but was not the National Security Advisor for four of them), so I didn't deduct any stars.  (Indeed, having briefed the National Security Council about the Saudi relationship to other Sunni societies, Varagur probably knows more about Western governments than I know as well.)Of all the people Varagur interviewed for this book, my favorite is Drilon Gashi, a moderate imam in the city of Peja, Kosovo, who tells his flock at the end of one sermon, ""If you don't enjoy life here, you won't enjoy the afterlife.""  I believe what he is trying to say is that we should all enjoy the good things in life (since all religions will acknowledge you can't enjoy ALL of life).  Movements like Salafism came about because (largely as a result of Western imperialism) Muslims who in previous centuries had had access to what they considered the good things in life did not by the nineteenth century, when Salafism became a strong movement in Islam.  Anti-Muslim movements from India to America point to the rise of Salafism as justification for their stance but just as with the Salafists, the more their populations embrace and empower them, the more the good things in life, from bikinis to beer, will tend to disappear.

451,"stand alone but would be best if you’d read the 1st two volumes.“Savage Son”, by Jack Carr, is a good book that could be a great book, even spectacular.  Each chapter alternates between locales.  In the beginning, it was hard to catch the story threads due to the short chapters and quick changing scenes.  It evens out but towards the later part of the book I found it annoying.  Fewer chapter breaks and longer periods of development would have been more satisfying, IMO.The book is written from a third person POV, which I also found unusual, especially knowing the experience and gravitas the author could add as the narrator thru character, James Reece.  The relationships between the 3 main characters was intricate and interesting but I so wanted to have Reece be the storyteller.Action and adventure scenes are magnificent and show the expertise of the author along with the intrigue.  Since the copy I read was a review arc, when I came to the first redacted place, I tho’t it was an error in the manuscript!  It wasn’t until the 3rd or 4th time that I figured out it was a literary device 🥴 Very imaginative on Carr’s part, not so quick in the uptake, for me...All things considered, a good thriller without gratuitous violence, sexual content or foul language 📚",4,0,1272,0.177,1

Lydia and Samuel were forced to marry by their parents after she became pregnant.  They went from lust to marriage skipping the courtship stage of the relationship.  Lydia wants romance and a chance to fall in love with the husband she hardly knows.  Samuel and Lydia are asked to introduce Joe, a co-worker of Samuel’s to Beverly, a friend of Lydia’s.  The foursome have a lively dinner together and then a picnic.  Lydia and Samuel like watching their friends fall in love.  It gives Samuel the idea to court Lydia.  Just when they are getting to know each other, Lydia and Beverly begin looking into the local homeless woman with a mysterious past.  Samuel wants Lydia to avoid the woman, but Lydia wants to help her.  Will Lydia and Samuel get the chance to have a traditional marriage?  While A Beautiful Arrangement is the third book in An Amish Journey series, it can be read as a standalone.  I have enjoyed all three novels and I recommend reading Hearts in Harmony and Listening to Love.  I thought A Beautiful Arrangement was well-written with realistic characters.  Lydia is a seventeen-year-old who is unready for marriage especially to a man she hardly knows.  Her six-month-old daughter, Maddie has been crying each day and Lydia does not why.  She feels like a bad mother (I know that feeling).  Lydia and Samuel want to improve their marriage, but they do not share these thoughts we each other.  They both have fears, regrets, and hopes.  When they introduce Beverly and Joe to each other, they get to join them on a couple of dates.  It gives Samuel and Lydia a chance to get to know each other.  They are each afraid to make the first move, though, for fear of rejection.  Samuel is also worried about his elderly parents.  His father has heart problems and his mother is unable to care for him like she used to.  Beverly and Joe were delightful additions to the story.  Joe is a lively man with a humorous side. I liked the addition of the mystery involving the homeless Amish woman.  It added more depth and interest to this engaging Amish novel.  I quickly found myself engrossed in this appealing story.

I have read some bad reviews of this book, and of course I respect them, as each person has his own preferences in art and art learning as in everything else: nevertheless some of the bad critics are  based in the quality of the drawings shown in the book: I think these  reviewers maybe are missing the fact that  the majority of the  drawings of the book are diagrams,  sketches and what the author calls ""learn drawings"", not finished pieces, as the intention of the author is to show his method of constructing the human figure, not a porfolio of his fine art.",5,0,1272,0.085,1

However, many will probably find this boring due to it being mostly one and done issues that don't lead into any immediate stories.  But for those who have read his previous Marvel work and his East of West (probably his best work), then this is par for the course.  It's just amazing world building for the X-Men who have entered a new status quo since Hickman's House of X and Powers of X.  Each issue brings a new enemy or concept into the fold that I can't say I've ever seen before in X-Men, and it all works perfectly (my favorite issue in this has to be the one where they talk to the Earth's human leaders).  Every character is also written perfectly, Magneto asserting his dominance, Professor X being kind but also leader-like.  Also, since Marvel has revamped X-Men and has put all their efforts into the mutants, this series has also gotten top tier art.  The art by Yu and others is perfect, it provides all the details that make every panel worth reading.  The awesome coloring also plays a role in the issues, especially the one with Mystique.

A year after their whirlwind romance and marriage, Violet and James had a huge falling out and have barely spoken to each other for the last four years.  A slight mix-up after James suffers a head injury from a horse accident leads to Violet feigning an illness to get back at her insufferable husband.  The hilarious hijinks that ensue left me with a smile on my face the entire time!Normally, enemies-to-lovers is one of my favorite romance tropes, but the lovers-to-enemies-to-lovers storyline in this one was even more fun.  The back-and-forth banter between Violet and James had me cracking up.  My only complaints are that the book was a little slow to start and there were times when I was just so irritated with Violet and James and their lack of communication, but it did make the growth of their relationship even sweeter in the end.If you like enemies-to-lovers, give this one a try for a little something different!

A shape-shifting figure follows him from Egypt, intent upon getting revenge on Lessingham.  While the book has some interesting aspects, it lacks important plot elements.  For example, (spoiler alert) the book builds up to a confrontation between the ""good guys"" (Lessingham and company) and the ""bad guys"" (the Beetle).  Yet, that confrontation never occurs.  The end of the book also leaves some loose ends.Despite the plot problems, and the archaic attitude toward race mentioned by other reviewers, the book has some fascinating aspects.  The character of Sydney Atherton, a lovestruck mad scientist, is especially compelling.  He narrates the second section of the novel; later, we read other characters' impressions of him.  This dual view gives a fascinating portrait of Atherton's character.The novel also differs from most canonical Victorian fiction.  It openly mentions nakedness more often than I've seen in any other novel from this time period.

They lack interesting twists, intelligent dialogue and character development.  ""The Missing Sister"", in particular,over uses they same gimmick that was over-used in Dead Letter.  That is emails between identical twin sisters who've been out of touch for several years because one has chosen to decamp to Paris leaving the other to tend to family responsibilities.  The emails take up much of both books.  Yet, they provide little insight into the twins or their relationship.  They're a garble of resentment, of not knowing each other, and of asserting that they have some sort of magical connection.  The endings of both are predictable.  Finally, on page 8 of ""The Missing Sister"", a character tells one of the twins that he and her sister have matching Gemini tattoos on their ankles.

It covers a time period with which I have only basic familiarity, and there were a lot of personal connections I hadn’t understood before.Unfortunately, I also found the book slow going and the explanations of the connections vague.  This isn’t a whodunit type of mystery; rather, the mystery centers around why the beast (a recently unearthed set of dinosaur bones) is so important to the king.  Although this is eventually resolved, I found the resolution unsatisfactory and overall, the book just seemed to plod.  I did a lot of skipping and never seemed to lose the story at all.This is the first book I’ve read in this series, and I had the sense that perhaps it wasn’t working well as a stand-alone story.  There was some development of relationships among the characters, but lacking the foundation for these, I didn’t care much about how they proceeded.

If ye keep reading this log then ye have been forewarned and continue at yer own peril . . .I really enjoyed book one of this series.  It had wonderful world building, excellent characters, a fantastic magic system, and a heist gone wrong.  So I was super excited to get a chance to read book two.  Sadly this was just okay.The main issue for me is that the scope of the novel was too big in terms of ideas.  The first novel was a character driven story that felt intimate and fun.  I loved watching the characters grow and influence the world around them.  And of course so much of that fun involved the key.  Now I didn't read the blurb and went into this blind.  Mehaps that was the problem.Now don't get me wrong, I still love the characters and the world in general.  I loved the set-up for this book and was looking forward to the scrapes that Sancia was going to get herself both into and out of.  Well sadly, both her and the other characters get lost in the minutiae of the set-up for the big showdown in book three.  Also suddenly all of the characters seem to have acquired the ability to be super-humans and conveniently get themselves out of everything with rather little effort.  Sancia in particular just seemed to ease her way through every magic situation with her talent.  I wanted more struggle and character connections.Really I wanted the character-driven story back.  The plot also became a bit too meta for me.  I can't get into it because of spoilers but it was both convenient and lackluster.  Perhaps this was because I have read other books where the same type of magic happens.  There wasn't enough difficulty in execution and adjustment.  The two main characters in this situation just seem to take it in stride and it became a little too woo woo in terms of making human relationships better.  Argh!  I wish I could explain this better but I don't want to ruin it for those who may find these circumstances mind-blowing.The crew has overwhelmingly given this one five stars.  Wish I could say the same.  I am likely to read the last book because of how the battle has begun.  I actually did think the ending was the best part.  I am interested in seeing how the mess gets resolved.  I just be sad that book two didn't make me fall in love the way book one did.I received a copy from the publisher in exchange for me honest musings.",3,0,2489,0.181,1
469,"The premise of this book was fabulous and timely.  The writing was spot on and engaging.  The characters were well done, and the conflicts were angst ridden.  I was totally invested in the story.  Unfortunately, the ending felt rushed and a bit unsatisfying.There were so many relationships woven throughout the book and as I turned the last page, I was left with many questions.  What happened to Finn and his brothers?  Did Francine and Drew marry?  What about their baby?  I assume that Sawyer and Serenity stayed together…at least they’re both there when they visit Reagan in New York.  Where does Rally end up?  What about Lorelei?  Lucy?  How did Serenity’s siblings take their new relationship?  With the twist at the end, do Serenity, Reagan, and Lorelei have other siblings?  Way too many questions.  The epilogue seemed like a cliff hanger, rather than a vehicle to tie up the loose ends.I’m a fan of Brenda Novak and her books are on my auto-buy list.  I’ll continue to purchase and read her books.  As I stated above, the writing is always good.  Sometimes the stories are detail heavy.  With One Perfect Summer, the details were relevant and moved the story along.  I’m hoping this is book one, and we’ll see the resolution of the sister’s story in book two!",3,0,1271,0.102,1
470,"This book has a lot of great historical information regarding women’s roles in numerous innovations that unfortunately in the past were only credited to men.  These innovations included poetry, novels, medicine, astronomy, architecture, chemistry, mathematics, and many more.  I liked that the author focused much of this book on the many female innovators that did not receive recognition during their lifetime.  They are now able to receive credit for their great accomplishments even though it is long past due for many of them.  I also liked that the author gave each of these female innovators their own chapter, which detailed out their life from birth, how they developed into the person they came to be, their accomplishments, and their struggles with gender discrimination.  I really enjoyed reading all these women’s stories which were very inspiring to see what they were able to accomplish even with many of them having to remain anonymous.  It was also sad to see how these women were treated but it was also uplifting to see that they were leaders in changing how women are treated today.  There is still progress to be made in gender equality but this book does a great job of showing the great progress we have made.

471,"Before hearing about ""The Joy of Falling"" on social media, I had not heard of or read anything by Lindsay Harrel.  I was immediately drawn to two things about this book other than the fact that the plot sounded really good.  One of those things being the beautiful cover of the book.  The colors of the cover alone drew me to want to read this book.  The second thing that immediately drew me to wanting to read this book was that one of the main characters and I share a name.  Once I started reading this book, I really hated the times I had to put it down in order to get other things done.  This author did an amazing job of drawing you into the lives of Angela and Eva.  I felt like I was right there with them and experiencing what they were going through with them.  I found myself wanting to encourage both of them when things got tough and listening to them when all they needed was an ear.  I really loved this book so much that I would recommend it to anyone but I would especially recommend it to anyone who has lost a spouse because it seemed like there was great advice in it for someone who would find themselves in a similar situation as these two women found themselves.",5,0,1187,0.138,0

473,"I received this beautiful book a few days ago.  I like to try a few recipes throughout a new cookbook right away, so I decided to make the “Classic Cardamom Buns”.  Also, this particular recipe is the base for at least a couple other recipes in the book. At first glance, the recipe looks intimidating, because not only does it call for a mixture of melted butter, milk and cardamom (which I use quite frequently), but also the author prefers to use a technique which is supposed to extend the freshness period of the buns.  This involves making a roux, the method many of us use to make sauces and gravies.I’m a fan of the mise en scene school of cooking, where one prepares all of the ingredients prior to cooking.  Some of the ingredients, such as the milk and flour, need to be divided.  Therefore I used the recipe along with the ingredient list to prepare for the various steps in the recipe.  Here I found a big problem.  The recipe calls for 1 1/2 c milk.  Yet if one goes by the recipe, 2/3 milk is used for one step and 1/3 for the next.  This adds up to 1 c milk.  Where does the other 1/2 milk go?I also was somewhat confused about the statement that the dough should be somewhat sticky and a bench scraper could be used to remove the dough from the kneading surface.  I’ve been baking bread for over 40 years, and I know that there is a great variety of stickiness in yeast doughs.  Those using milk and butter are also difficult to judge for this factor.  I added a moderate splash of milk to the dough, because the dough produced from following the directions was very heavy.  Again, this is typical of doughs using dairy ingredients.  I ended up with a sticky, heavy dough that didn’t rise as expected, even though I put it on top of a range with the oven heat at 350F.  I ended up extending the rising time and even so it never reached a size double to the original.  I further extended the baking time to 15 minutes and the rolls were not too dry.Just in case one wonders about the quality of the yeast I used, I used the same yeast on the same day and produced three light a fluffy loaves  challah.If I make this recipe again, and I probably will, I plan to use bread flour and adjust the rising times accordingly.  But first I’m going to do some research about this milk problem.I did give the book four stars, which might be prematurely over generous, as I have only tried in recipe so far.  I hope to update this review later as I discover how effective the other recipes are.",4,1,2498,0.072,1
474,"This (mostly) easy-to-read book reads like a magazine article written  by a committee and stretched on a rack until it reached book length.Part of the committee was trying to write a book about the 2015 Baltimore riots/protests, from the points of view of a police officer, a city councilman, a couple of lawyers, a baseball team owner, a businessman in one of the city's poor areas, and a couple of protestors.  For each of the five days, each of these observers gets a short chapter or two.  I mostly liked this part of the book, even though I felt some of the stories were less engaging than others.The other part of the committee was busy writing bits and pieces of well-worn liberal dogma, inserted here and there throughout the book (and at the beginning and at the end as well).  For example, here's a sentence that looks like it lifted from a college term paper: ""If sports fandom has a politics, it's decidedly conservative- not in terms of policies but in a sense that professional sports frequently affirms narrow, retrograde ideas of patriotism, gender roles, capitalism and race.""Nevertheless,  the book doesn't conceal the reality behind the headlines: that after the riots, a few bad cops got caught, but otherwise life got even more dangerous for Baltimore's poor.",3,0,1280,0.043,1

I cannot say I agree with everything Pastor Anna embraces in her views, but one thing is certain in my mind: Jesus would LOVE this garden church, and because of that, the walls in my mind are starting to come down.This is absolutely church re-imagined.  Traditional church has become so steeped in historical comfort that the walls are not just physical, but used as a barrier to keep our couch comfy minds appeased.  We say ""all are welcome"" but the walls themselves are a barrier to those who are truly in need.  The needy are not comfortable to be around.  It takes patience.  Patience that I do not currently possess.  The walls give me security.  This is what I have gleaned from reading this book.Gardening is not my thing, but I certainly see how this wall-less, roofless oasis, strategically placed in the center of need can transform life.

The botanical drawings are also beautiful and scaled to be accurate and useful.  I also love the ecological and caretaking approach introduced in the first chapters.  The seasonal organization is also so sensible, as is the consistent organization of the plant chapters.  The book even tells you how and when to harvest.  And don't forget that most of the plants are useful for nutrition (i.e., delicious recipes) as well as medicine.  Another thing to pay attention to in these precarious times.

While these traits might be admirable, in the practice of law, this might also bring about another set of problems.  This is an intricate story with not one but three cases to be tried. - Two in 1907 and one that springs from a past case.  This time period is in flux, between the use of horse drawn carriages and the fledgling automobile.  World War I has not occurred yet, so the decimation of a generation of men is still in the future.

She has in prior books provided valuable insight and information to Daniel.The initial mystery centered around the murder of two conspirators in theft and the arson of a warehouse.

In fact, I recommend that if you ever read Sun Stand Still, you follow it up with Put Your Dream to the Test.  This book can help give greater clarity to your visions for the future, help you discover whether what you are seeking is a dream or a delusion, and gives much practical advice for following your dream to the utmost.

Shayna doesn't know who to trust and follows a trail of breadcrumbs that she believes Angela left her to find out the truth.I initially wasn't sure I would be interested in the story, with side plots around human trafficking and Parisian history, but I was fascinated by the storylines in those areas.My primary issue with this book, which is why I am rating a strong 3 starts instead of 4, is that I was unable to truly understand Angela's character.  You get to know her through Shayna's memories/thoughts as well as emails that she has sent throughout the years, and I felt like all of these things were in contrast with each other, and I just couldn't figure out what kind of person Angela was.

The only point of engagement was the recognition of characters from the prequel Camino Island.It was very amateurish writing.  The characters were very two-dimensional.  The dialogue was not engaging.  The whole story felt like it was being unemotionally told rather than being drawn in.Worst of all, it was a murder mystery with no mystery!The entire story plot was revealed in the first three chapters and the rest of the book was just substantiating data for what had already been revealed.Because of my high esteem for John Grisham, I plugged ahead with reading, thinking there would surely be some redeeming surprise plot twist at the end.

It took me a while to accept that Pitt, the son, was the main protagonist in this series, though Pitt Sr, appears briefly in each book, as does Lady Pitt.  The apple didn't fall far from the tree, as Pitt Jr. displays the same passion for justice as does his father--and mother!  The English legal system worked a bit differently from the American system, but the differences in both the time period, and the approach taken, are so interesting.  In 1910/1911, women are also starting to come into their own, though male privilege, in ALL classes in this country, is still rampant.  That becomes very apparent in this book as well.  Supporting characters are becoming more fleshed out as this series continues, and they are proving to be of great interest too!All in all, another winner from Anne Perry, and l am still looking forward to new books in all her other series!

488,"Thank you to #NetGalley, the author and the publisher for providing me with a digital copy of this book prior to publication in exchange for my review.  This is Big: How the Founder of Weight Watchers Changed the World (and Me) is really two stories.  It is Marisa Meltzer's story of her own battle with weight but interwoven with her own story is the story of Jean Nidetch, the founder of Weight Watchers and the parallels between their stories.  Meltzer's weight issues began when she started her first diet at age five.  In fact, she and her mother joined Weight Watchers together when she was in elementary school.  Meltzer's story is very relatable as  talks about being frustrated with her body image and the mental, emotional and physical toll that food and dieting take on an individual.  As she grew up, food became the defining relationship in her life, something she addresses honestly and with humor.  I think the message that really stands out in this book is that each of us is struggling with something and we just need to be aware of that and realize that we are not alone.

Taking one chapter at a time, and using Becky's guidance at the end of each chapter for being quiet in your own inner chapel, will turn all heads towards our God.  Your inner chapel is the place in your heart where only you and God reside.  Use her suggestions of Scripture passages, or your own, to hear what God is saying to you in his own words.  Our God who loves us and never leaves us alone, will come into your life in a more vivid way than you could have ever possibly imagined.  Becky uses her ordinary life with her family, to provide examples of how God is walking with us every moment of every day.  Reading about how she has grown to realize that God is with her, helps the reader to visual moments in his/her daily life where God was there, but unrecognizable until later.

490,"When you can’t even afford a burrito and you live with your parents, how can you possibly even think about finding financial freedom?  Well, as crazy as that sounds, Grant Sabatier did just that.  Part autobiographical, but mostly a down-to-earth, how-to guide, Grant chronicles his remarkable five year journey from broke to millionaire.  Sabatier, creator of Millennial Money, wrote this book to educate, encourage, and inspire others to forge their own path to financial freedom.In Financial Freedom, Grant thoroughly discusses the mechanics of earning more, optimizing expenses, and investing intelligently, customizing the journey for your circumstances.  He offers a step by step plan to stay in tune with your money, showing you what to do each day, week, month, and year.Sabatier’s Financial Freedom stands out because it presents a cohesive way to design your financial life.  Few other resources offer such a systematic approach.  Grant’s personal story, and the commentary from others who have achieved financial freedom, show the concepts discussed in the book in action.Grant’s writing style is conversational and approachable.  You feel like you’re having a beer with him, rather than reading some dry finance book.  The informal nature of the book makes for an easy, enjoyable read.Further, Grant generously shares many tools and calculators that he created in order to facilitate your understanding and application of the steps outlined in the book.  It’s clear that he’s invested in your success.There’s no surprise ending or plot twist here. Grant applied the financial principles presented in this book and, in half of a decade, found himself financially free.  His message is that his story could be your story — adapted to your personal situation.This book further cemented for me that hard work and discipline can create many more financially free people than there are today and that financial freedom is a worthwhile aspiration for all.  However, I realize that personal circumstances can either facilitate or hamper the journey to get there (a fact that Sabatier also acknowledges).Personally, with 300k in debt and a desire to be financially free before traditional retirement age, Grant’s message was very inspirational to me.  I highly recommend Financial Freedom to anyone that’s ready to challenge their thoughts about money and build a life that they love.Disclaimer: I was given an advance copy of this book in exchange for writing this review.  I may also benefit from other indirect compensation from the author.  However, that has in no way influenced the opinions that I have expressed here.",5,0,2627,0.268,1
491,"In ""Put your Dream to the Test,"" John Maxwell challenges his readers to look closely at their dreams.  Many of us dream, yet few of us actually achieve them.  This book offers practical insight into why that could be so.  Maxwell asks 10 questions that focus on topics such as clarity, reality, passion, strategy, cost and fulfillment.  Each chapter begins with an inspirational story of someone who has achieved their dream.  Maxwell then gives practical advice on how the reader can do the same.  The book begins with a dream test and concludes with a section to help you map out your dream.  These tools help turn the book into more of a workbook, as opposed to simply a good read.I personally enjoyed this book very much.  Reading it not only helped me to clearly visualize my dream, but it also acted as a reminder that there is sacrifice and cost involved in achieving that dream.  I highly recommend ""Put Your Dream to the Test"" to anyone with a dream looking for an inspirational book combined with practical advice.  It could also make a great graduation or retirement gift.

492,"As a long-time fan of Jen Hatmaker, I was already looking forward to reading her latest book.  What I didn't realize is how much I needed this book in my life right now.  Jen has an easy, comfortable writing style that is always accessible, honest, and funny.  While all of that is true in this book, Hatmaker truly lays it all in the open here.  Divided into 5 sections: (Who I Am, What I Need, What I Want, What I Believe, and How I Connect), she manages to draw the reader into self-analysis through her own relatable antedotes and ties in more controversial topics such as gender equality, LGBTQ rights, and personal faith and organized religion with grace and understanding.  Drawing from her deep well of personal life experience, readers will learn, think deeply, and be inspired to be Fierce, Free, and Full of Fire themselves.  While not a particularly long book, Fierce is not a quick read.  I found myself pausing after each chapter to digest what I had read and frequently went back to reread particularly outstanding passages.  Fierce Free and Full of Fire is not just an excellent read, it is an important book for all women searching for their true selves. (News Flash: that is all of us.) Highly recommended.",5,0,1224,0.212,0

494,"Seriously, the narration of this book sounds exactly like a low budget black and white film from the late '30's or early '40's.  A common device used in those flix was to have the main character narrate everything in that drab, cheesy way so they didn't have to actually film much on location, and most of the action happened in one or two rooms, with a lot of driving around in a big old car with fins front & back & our heroine invariably coiffed in a ponytail with those ugly curled under short bangs like Ronald Raygun's first wife used to wear.  This was enhanced by the ever increasingly 'need a man to help me outta this jam' ascared actress driving in the rain cranking that steering wheel back and forth like she was driving on the tiniest zig zagging road ever built.  I just couldn't go on.  How on earth does a modern writer use such a weak brained 80 year old unemancipated ""I'm goin' off my nut, can't ya' see??!!?"" patois for a modern female character?  The plot is ridiculous and reads like something out of a bad 1970 Saturday afternoon aired scary movie set in two rooms of a 'mansion' in England where a bunch of miscreants & reprobates who are loosely related must stay overnight to hear The Will.

495,"This is a new author for me (have not read anything of hers before this) so was excited to start the story.  I found I was immediately pulled in with opening scene of Winter's divorce signing, so I knee this was going to be a fast moving story.  Winter is a very likable character to me, one I got behind right from the start., yes she was a bit flawed in her insecurities (but the ex seemed to contribute to that), but so strong and supportive to her friends and to Pandora.Pandora, the other leading character, was this image I had in my head of Gretta Garbo or Marlene Dietrich, beautiful and so mysterious.  Throw in a night club, some nasty patrons, and a meddling Aunt and you have your self a story.The book moved along at a good pace, and the relationship with Winter and Pandora was a good mix.  I also enjoyed the different turn of phrases the author used being Australian (I am American), I just overall enjoyed the story line.  I will definitely be looking for more from this Author and will look to pickup some of her older books.I received an ARC through Netgalley in exchange for an honest review, but would have written the same opinion if I had come across this author on my own.",5,0,1196,0.192,0
496,"If the purpose of a book is to take you to a place you’ve never been, then this one fulfilled that role.  Seoul, Korea and the young girls trying to make their way in a competitive world where beauty is the sole focus and plastic surgery is the norm.This book is just heartbreaking right from the get go.  It delves into the lives of five young women that live in the same apartment building.  We hear from four of them, in alternating chapters.  This book was a real eye opener for me.  I knew about the consumerism and boy band fetish.  But I hadn’t realized what a strict class system Korea has, despite being a capitalist society.  And while in some ways modern, in other ways Korean society remains extremely misogynistic.This is a character driven book.  It reminds me of Elizabeth Strout’s style of writing.  The chapters overlap and the characters interact, but the chapters aren’t linear or tightly joined together.  These weren’t necessarily women I could relate to and I definitely didn’t like some of them.  But yet, each one touched my heart.  Their lives are so tough.  And this isn’t a story that gives you happy endings for them.This novel is extremely polished and doesn’t come across as a debut novel.",4,0,1219,0.107,0
497,"I don’t know why, but every year I feel compelled to read the annual installment of Ms Thompson’s “Gaslight Mysteries” series featuring Frank and Sarah Malloy.  Maybe I am hoping the plots will get better.  The earlier ones were much better.  “Murder on Pleasant Avenue” was easy to read, but they are all easy to read, because it is just full of dialogue.  There was minuscule amount of action, and Sarah seems to have faded into the background.  The author did state in the author’s note that fans wanted her to focus on Gino and Maeve.The plot in this mystery (loosely termed here, because the answer was apparent from the beginning) is that an Italian woman was kidnapped by the Black Hand.  The Black Hand was a notorious group of Italians back in the nineteenth century.  They kidnapped people and then extorted the relatives for money.  I was more intrigued by this bit of history than I was by the story.  Back to the book...then a young lady also disappears, and Gino gets arrested for the murder of a Black Hand member.  As mentioned, The Who-dun-it was predictable and in my opinion, the ending was unrealistic.  I give it 3 stars, because it did inspire me to research on The Black Hand group.",3,0,1205,0.187,0

In this book, he outlines ten checkpoints that will help guide you to whether your dream will stand the test.These checkpoints include:  * The Ownership Question - is my dream really my dream - when it all comes down to it, do you truly believe in this dream, if not you need to re-evaluate  * The Passion Question - will I follow my own dream - will I be passionate to see it through so that I can bring others along eventually  * The Cost Question - will I pay the price for my dream - sacrificially giving to the dream, sometimes the cost is manageable and other times, the cost is too high - there needs to be a healthy balance  * The Significance Question - will this dream benefit others - if the dream doesn't benefit others in the long run, you may want to double-check the dream - help others grow!This book will challenge you to put action to your dreams.  Many people dream, but putting action to them is a different story.  John challenges you to answer each question fully.

And it's one you can read over and over again at various points in your life and get something different out of it every time.  What a beautiful and continuous gift this book is!No matter where you are in your spiritual life, the author's words and writing style gently coax you into digging deeper.  Like a comforting friend, Becky Eldredge takes your hand and slowly walks with you on the path to find your own Inner Chapel where God resides and has always been.  Becky does this through genuine and heartfelt testimony and stories, which allows the reader to get to know and trust her.  In one of the chapters, I loved how she was able to genuinely convey her own doubts and how she fell victim to others' hurtful or thoughtless comments.  She then identified that God wanted to free her--us too--from the prison we can be put in by the words of others or by feelings we have in response.  How powerful is that?  And that is just one small example from this jewel of a book!Before you know it, you realize that Becky has intricately guided you into a deeper spirituality--your own Inner Chapel and you are better for it.",5,0,1234,0.216,0

It is the mission statement of our Delilah, to let each every heart and soul we come across know... that they are valued.... they are worthy of love... they are unique... and they are created in the image of the most awesome artist and creator.

502,"Martine Murphy’s debut novel, THE LAST SUMMER OF ADA BLOOM, is set in southern Australia during what seems to be a very hot, sultry summer.  (Northern Hemisphere readers:  Do remember that summer in the Southern Hemisphere would be during the holiday season.)  Ada, in sixth grade, is the youngest born of Mike and Martha.  Her siblings are young adults or nearly so.This novel tells of a particular summer, when Ada discovers some secrets about others in the family and has her own secret place to go when she wants to be alone.  The eyes through whom we see this novel change from one character to another as the novel progresses, though Ada is the primary protagonist.  There are incidents of adultery (Ada’s parents) and underage drinking (her siblings) making this a novel more for adults or older teens than youngsters Ada’s age.One issue I found that I hope experience will help:  The style and sentences throughout, even when Ada is not the highlighted character, seem to be almost like a youngster’s.  Murphy doesn’t seem to change the style and structure to go along with the character she’s bringing forward.  As I say, though, perhaps experience will help here.Overall, though, whenever summer occurs where you are, you will probably find this novel interesting.",4,0,1274,0.138,0
503,"Based on history and events of the past, this book helps one understand why offers of land have not led to peace between the Israelis and Palestinians.  Coming from the Left, Wilf was part of this process and apparently still hopes for a two-state solution.  Yet, it is clear that ""Return,"" in other words the dissolution of Israel, is prioritized over Statehood by the Palestinians, and that this fact is what is getting in the way of a path forward.  As is often expressed by Palestinian leaders and civilians, that is the true message behind such statements as ""Free Palestine"" and ""From the River to the Sea, Palestine will be Free.""  As Wilf and Schwartz communicate, many millions of people displaced by war and the transition from empires to nation-states resettled and prospered.  If Palestinians would accept the prospect of building a state in the West Bank and Gaza, and Israelis were to leave certain areas deemed essential to Palestinians or offer acceptable  land swaps, peace could be within reach.  The notion that millions of people and their children,  born and raised as citizens of other countries, are still considered ""Palestinian Refugees"" is beyond unreasonable, and serves to maintain the culture of victimhood of Palestinians and the stagnation of the peace process.",5,0,1292,0.113,1

This is told to readers through the vantage point of 8 different people from drastically different backgrounds whose lives all were touched by the unfolding events.The story centers on Freddie Grey's hard life and early death, tracing how systemic, institutional poverty and racism create a system of inequality so extreme that children like Freddie have no chance.  Against this backdrop are 8 people struggling to find their own justice or fairness in a system designed to deny exactly that.Seeing through the eyes of both prominent and unheralded residents of Charm city allows you to understand the community in ways the news media cannot.

The businesses of Redwood Cove are all pitching in on an event meant to raise awareness of how many of the area veterans are struggling as well as to raise funding for the projects in place to assist them.  Local wineries are sponsoring tastings, and professional chefs are foraging for wild edibles in preparation for the culinary competition associated with the veterans’ event.  Lots of mischief is afoot in the small coastal town: plant poachers, hostile environmental activists, murder, theft, kidnappings, ransom demands, and a frame-up.  With so much going on, can Kelly and the Silver Sentinels get the mysteries solved in time to support the local veterans, or will the super sleuths be overwhelmed?  This time, someone may get away with murder.I liked this book and enjoy the series.  I recommend this book to fans of the series.

507,"When talking hoops with people these days, it’s sad because the legends of the past are often forgotten.  And that’s the case when talking professional ball or street-ball.  You watch TV and you would think that the game was played by only Magic & Bird in the 80’s, followed by Jordan in the 90’s.  Growing up in Philadelphia I know better.  One of the most popular figures of my childhood was Julius “Dr. J” Erving.  He was larger than life in the city.  He was also a legend in street-ball.  Most of the older men in my neighborhood wanted to be him and all of the older ladies would have given him their love canal if they had the chance.  Not only was he considered a great ball player but he has always been considered someone who carried himself with class.The great thing about biographies is the chance to hear stories and learn details about someone’s life you had no knowledge of.  The Doc was an amazing ball player and he did carry himself with class but he was far from perfect.  This book is not only filled with amazing stories of legendary games and players but it also talks about his shortcomings and his personal struggles.  If you are a hoops fan and love the history of the game, this is a must-read.  The stories of playing one on one with Pistol Pete and George Gervin are amazing.  His relationship and thoughts on other legends such as Kareem and Bill Russell are also great.  There are also stories of Moses, Barkley, Magic, Bird, and many more.Much was made of his story of fathering a child with a woman who was not his wife.  Not because he cheated but because in the words of Jadakiss, “It’s no way she gonna have a baby out of her mouth”.  Doc said she only became pregnant because she couldn’t give him a twirly due to getting braces and they had “traditional” sex only one time.  Now when I first heard about that excerpt I laughed and said, “damn, Doc was foul for talking about the mother of his child that way”.  When reading what he said and putting it into context, it doesn’t come off the same.  Don’t get me wrong, Doc is still a creep, but he was being honest and transparent when telling his story.As a hoops fan and one who loves the history of the game, this book was amazing.  I may overrate it based on the fact that I’m a hoops junkie.  This was a great story that dealt with race, poverty, basketball, business, family, and making love to a lot of women.  That will always be a recipe for a great book in my opinion.",5,0,2464,0.193,0
508,"This is the first Chronos book I have read.  I found it to be confusing with the different sets of characters from 2 different times in the future.  Some were better developed than others, but with all the time jumps, rules about them, ancestors, relatives, etc., I could not follow what was happening much of the time.  I generally enjoy time travel stories, especially the assumptions about what was and was not possible, but this book seems to assume readers know a lot of those already.  Not knowing added to the confusion..Another issue is not knowing what historically was true.  I was glad to read that at the end of the book but would have appreciated it as perhaps in an introduction at the beginning.  I think in dealing with real history, it would have been useful to me as a reader to know about the historic events before the story addresses them.  I do, however like the idea of time travelers altering events and presenting the consequences of doing so.I was young when the Beatles first came to the US but didn’t know why they stopped touring here.  I am glad that Walker included those historic events.  It’s an interesting approach, and a nice glimpse into the 1960s and 1950s.",3,0,1195,0.162,1
509,"The Last Summer of Ada Bloom is a finely written novel that examines the inner workings of one Australian family during one summer.  It's full of family secrets, drama and all sorts of dysfunction.  It presents itself as a coming of age novel, which are usually associated with teen dramas.  This book is a reminder that it's often the adults who need to ""come of age"".  Ada Bloom is nine years old, an irrepressible youngster who charms everyone.  Unfortunately, she belongs to a family full of seriously flawed and often downright unlikable characters that turn this book into a sometimes distasteful slog.  The family members who need to grow and mature the most don't really show much change, which leaves poor Ada floating around like some demented little sprite.  I never totally bought into Ada's character, and by the end of this novel I was wondering just what exactly was the point.I bump this up to three stars simply because of the beautiful writing.  Rest assured the author perfectly evokes a hot Australian summer, and does provide a few perceptive, memorable moments that shine due to an expert turn of phrase.

510,"Authors MacFarlane and Salmon have done Sailors, Seamen, Yachtsmen, and Armchair Nautical buffs a great favor in bringing to the public’s attention, in this well-researched and written book, the round-the-world voyage, at the turn of the last century, of Captain John Voss in the Tilikum.  After reading the title of the book, and having spent some time at sea myself, my first thought was “that’s impossible.”  Even after learning that Voss had made significant changes to the 38-foot whaling canoe fashioned from a cedar log, in which he would undertake the voyage, such as bending in ribs, and adding a keel, ballast, sails, water tanks, and other essentials, I still did not believe it was possible.  Such an adventure came to fruition, because Voss was one of the greatest small-craft sailors that ever lived, incredibly tough, and lucky.  Of special significance was his design and mastery of a special sea anchor, which acted as a drag, and otherwise prevented the Tilikum from capsizing and sinking in large storms and typhoons encountered on the open ocean.  As it were the voyage was so incredibly challenging, that at the end of each leg, the mate aboard to help him sail the tiny vessel would quit, and Voss would have to find a replacement ashore for the next lengthy stint at sea.",5,0,1294,0.14,0

Their families are friends and always spend the summers in neighboring lake houses.  This is the last summer before they head out to college and Sydney is determined to make sure this is the summer she pulls off the best prank ever and wins their eternal feud.I absolutely loved the chemistry between Sydney and Asher.  Even as “enemies” their banter is wonderful.  The pranks they play on each other are hilarious and their interactions are great.  I loved how the author gives us flashbacks to past summers which answer questions not only we as readers, but they, the characters, also have throughout the novel.Asher and Sydney are adorable together and it takes them a few more pranks and an eventful summer to realize that they are better off as soemthing other than enemies.“It’s a lot weirder to pretend I haven’t had a crush on you for a million years.”If you love cute and funny enemies-to-lovers stories I highly recommend this one.*A huge thanks to Tor Teen for providing me with an eARC for review.

It has come at a good time in her life as something happened at her job in advertising back in Chicago (would of liked to have known more about that).  She is meeting up with her two childhood friends Diane and Beau who are brother and sister and meeting her in her new hometown of Little Acorn.  She is confused and not sure what to do but when she finds a body in her tomato fields as they are giving a realtor a walk around it pretty much forces her to stay.  The longer she is there the harder it will be her to go as the beauty of the farm and the animals especially Horse (who is a pig).  Charlotte feels a connection with the land and wants to do right by her Uncle and the current caretakers of Alice and Joe along with Sawyer who is farming the land.  The mystery was good and this is a solid start to a new series that I look forward to reading more of in the future.

516,"Shelves of books have been authored on Big Tech  (or the FANG - Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, Google).  This book adds to that genre without much deviation from the narrative format.  There are ""inside"" stories of founders and how they convinced investors (and a couple or so of those who missed the opportunity),  an idealistic vision going commercial very quickly, fallout among key players, scale and growth, etc.  Here, Frier succeeds in using case studies of how others have built successful business models on top of Instagram - the influencer model.  One clearly gets a unfiltered look into how curated these offerings really are and how they tend to provide a selective view.  The book also adds insights on how a user's behavior (clicks/likes/posts...any interaction) is really the commodity being sold by these companies with the actual producer (you and me) not really getting any direct monetary participation.  That shouldnt be news to most users of Internet, but Frier tells that story in the context of Instagram.  From a techie perspective, I wish the author went into more details on how the media created different challenges than search or improvements needed for image recognition etc.  Overall, a breezy read - more like a Businessweek-like feature story.",4,0,1273,0.144,0

This book outlines a strategy to bring a dream from the stage of dreaming all the way to making that dream come to life and come true.  John Maxwell is a Leadership Councilor.  And in this book he reveals ten questions that a person should ask themselves if they want to bring a dream to life.I found this book a very inspirational piece of writing.  Up until now I have never come across a book that caused one to think carefully over personal dreams that I harbored.  It gave me ideas and motivation to work on my personal dream.  It gave advice and was very realistic about whether a dream could come true and reasons why for some people it won't.  This book appealed to me greatly because it gave me ten questions to ask myself.  And each time I was able to answer a question with a yes I felt more and more enthused in regards to my own personal dream.

Also along the way she will discover that like in Harry Potter there are those who look down on mundanes (non magic folk) and marriages outside of the Craft (but as Ron says, without them they would have died out long ago).

520,"Consider just this one paragraph taken from this book:“…losing a debate isn’t a sign of stupidity or weakness, but a sign of growth if you’re willing to embrace it with humility.”It was when I read that one sentence I realized that this book was indeed very special, at least to me .It is a book that as you read it, you find yourself putting the book down, taking a sip of your coffee, sitting back in your chair and not just think about what you have  read, you truly think about what you have just read.  Most books you just read, a sentence, a paragraph or a page, one at a time.  This book I found impossible to do that with because it did make me want to think not only about what Rubin had written but more importantly how I felt about what he had written and I began to question my own beliefs about a lot of very topical subjectsLook at the sub-title of the book, “Thinking For Yourself In An Age of Unreason.”  In my opinion Rubin has created a book that accomplishes that, it makes you think, maybe for the first time regarding some very important subjects.As background, Rubin points out that he was born Jewish in a stable family life in the New York City area.  Went to college and grew up like so many people from that part of the country having strong left, Liberal beliefs. Rubin also describes how he is gay and married.  He draws a picture of someone people on the political right would describe as being Liberal thinking.  But his beliefs have significantly changed in a relatively short-period of time.  He explains how the change took place in this book and why the changes occurred.  He talks about such subjects as abortion, minimum wage, racism, language, sexism, transgenderism, education, free speech, gun control, etc.The value of this book can be summarized in the last two paragraphs of Chapter 9:“You’ve never had such incredible power and reach.  We have no idea how that awesome power has changed the world already and will continue to do so.  So how are you going to use that power?  What do you want to put out into the universe?”“Begin your adventure now and you will be amazed at how you can change your world.”Who should read this book?  Since it would benefit everyone, everyone should read it but especially those who still believe in a perceived honesty of the news media.Would I read it again?  Probably not, the lessons of the book were well learned.Would I give it as a gift?  ABSOlUTELY!",5,0,2432,0.167,1
521,"This book is not like any other diet book you will find.  While weight loss may be the ultimate goal of anyone reading it, what truly happens when you follow the self-hypnosis practice and listen to the guided hypnosis recordings (which are provided for free) is that you begin to heal the subconscious parts of you that cause weight gain in the first place.  By diving into your subconscious and addressing the emotions behind your habits and actions, you are able to transform them and, in turn, yourself.While weight loss is the goal, it is just one benefit that comes from healing these different parts of yourself.  You will also learn  how to stop negative self-talk, let go of limiting beliefs, self-judgment, guilt, and find appreciation for your body- for what it is and what is does for you every day.There is an incredible amount of positive support in this book.  It written in a very positive, nonjudgmental manner with a nice, realistic humor sprinkled in.  There is free access to hypnosis recordings, and a Facebook group where you can find support from hundreds of people.For the daily journaling practice, I would recommend using a separate notebook to record goals, insights and progress instead of writing in the book itself.",5,0,1245,0.167,0
522,"I felt pulled to read this book because Sue Monk Kidd has been one of my favorite authors for many years.  I felt I could trust her to write a story worthy of its subject.  It took me awhile to read the book because I was still having a hard time with the possibility that Jesus would have been a normal Hebrew Jewish man and so would have been married.  The fact that at least some of his disciples were married, but history completely leaves them out of the New Testament makes it not too much of a stretch to think of Jesus being married.  It also took me a few more weeks to read because we know how the story ends and it would be extremely painful to read of Jesus's crucifixion....again.  Anyway, I finally read this book and was so impressed by Ana and the other female characters.  Sue Monk Kidd did an excellent job of making  Ana the main story but melding it with the Jesus story.  Ana  was a strong, courageous woman surrounded by strong, wonderful female characters.  Don't wait...read the book.  You will be glad you did and glad Ana's story has been told by a superb writer and story teller.  It is a work of fiction with a strong ring of truth.",5,0,1160,0.225,0

539,"""My Wandering Dreaming Mind"" is a wordless picture book.  Are wordless books valuable to a young reader?  The answer is a resounding YES!!!They:  * develop vocabulary and oral language development, * foster observation and critical thinking skills, * improve writing skills, * build reading comprehension skills and *enhance the understanding of the story elements (character, setting, plot and theme).Sadie is a little girl whose mind wanders and daydreams and she has a very hard time focusing on things.  It affects her quality of life:  her schoolwork, friends, and her everyday living.  She recognizes she is having difficulty concentrating but her mind just takes her off track time and time again.Fortunately her loving parents address her struggles and help her.  They work with her and come up with an effective plan that inspires and lifts Sadies spirit so she feels empowered to take on her battle with ADHD and feel more positive about herself.  The back of the book includes a note to parents and caregivers giving them more in-depth information and help if they have a child with similar issues.The illustrations are lovely.  They enrich the message of the book and make it more meaningful to both child and adult.  I highly recommend this book.",5,1,1259,0.213,0
540,"""The Heirloom Garden: A Novel"" is exactly the type novel you need in today's world.  It is uplifting, filled with gentle humor and wisdom, and contains characters who are appealing.  While some might consider Viola Shipman's novel saccharine sweet and unrealistic, it is a welcomed relief from the current pandemic situation.Surviving the WW II loss of her husband and the later death of her young daughter from polio, Iris Maynard has become a recluse.  Once a renowned botanist and now an heirloom gardener working for herself, Iris lives next door to another home, formerly her grandmother's, she owns.  When she rents the home to Abby Petersen, a young engineer, Iris' world is about to be upended.  Abby's young daughter Lily befriends a reluctant Iris.  When Abby's husband Cory returns from Afghanistan, suffering from PTSD, it is Iris who helps him seek therapy and a return to his family.  In turn, the Petersen's help Iris emerge from seclusion and to integrate into their family and the community.Viola Shipman has given readers a thoroughly enjoyable book.  It is one I would have formerly rated as 4-stars, but its message is relevant to today and is one that, under today's circumstances, deserves 5 stars.",5,0,1220,0.108,0
541,"I loved this debut novel and am anxious to see what will be next from this writer!Kate lost her job in NYC as a result of sexual harassment.  This loss caused her to lose more than her job - she lost her self-confidence, her career, her home as she was forced to take a job across the country and to live with an aunt and uncle while trying to regain her footing.  The job she takes is to archive the personal collection of Miranda Brand, an infamous artist who died under mysterious circumstances.  As Kate starts to work, she quickly becomes obsessed with the artist and her family and is driven to find out exactly how Miranda died.Told in the form of Miranda's writings and collections as well as Kate's life in the present, this is a great character-driven novel, delving into the personal feelings of everyone involved.  It also explores many current topics - mental illness, sexual harassment, abuse, feminism, as well as personal feelings of inadequacy and the result of keeping secrets.I lost myself in both these women's worlds and loved the creativity of the way the story was told.

542,"I know as a sometimes runner - depends on time of year and how disciplined I am - but I've always known that the limits to my capability are always more in my head than in my lungs or feet.  It is a constant head-game and not easy, as it takes a lot of reminding myself of that ironically.  But the body is pretty much only limited by what the brain says - likewise the capacity for success.  This book is not a dieting or food book, unlike others written by Ian Smith.  Yes, the focus is still on good choices, healthy eating, and following a plan - but it is more a book about setting goals and reaching them, understanding your weaknesses, strengths, and how to come up with a plan that works.  There are interactive pages after each chapter for you to think about how the sub-topic can be applied for you so that you can develop the best plan, and come up with goals that are attainable, and measurable, broken down into tiny successes that cumulatively build on each other.  Even if you are not trying to lose weight, the book is a good training path for goals, for reaching them and attaining success in life - but only if you interact with it and make it your own.",3,0,1171,0.2,0

She sets the stage so beautifully and poignantly for the telling of these stories that until now, were at risk of being buried along with these plucky Americans, who were every bit as valiant and courageous as their colleagues in combat.After reading this book, you will come away with a broader understanding and appreciation of the many different roles and duties carried out by these unsung veterans.  I know I did.  But the theme I most cherish after reading this book is the overwhelming patriotism and resiliency of Americans in a time of great strife in our country - that we came together, those in active combat duty along with so many in supporting roles here and overseas.  The stories also deliver messages of humility, hope, faith and family that extended well beyond the war.The theme rings true today...no matter the war we are facing, if we stand together and support each other, we can thrive and be stronger for it...not only individually but as a country.Thank you, Rona - for bringing these memoirs to life and doing it in such a compelling and special way.",5,0,1225,0.215,0
544,"Thank you NetGalley and Orca Book Publishers for providing an e-ARC for an honest review.The Stone of Sorrow is a nuanced narrative that explores a deficient YA Fantasy niche.  Brooke Carter deftly weaves Nordic mythology into her story and conjures a world of brutal beauty and magic.  It is a bleak world of survival and sacrifice, but at its core is a story of sisterly devotion and love.  Though undeniably absorbing, it is plagued by some flaws, especially pacing.  It begins with long, languid strokes, but then proceeds with a rapidity that is detrimental to the story.  The first part is bogged down by a bloated backstory, but once the action begins, there are few reflective moments.  This jarring change of pace diminishes the impact of individual events.  This is especially evident in the latter portion, where events quickly transpire with little differentiation.  The conclusion ultimately comes too swiftly and neatly resolves the story despite the sometimes messy, meandering preamble.  It is ultimately a satisfying conclusion, but perhaps a bit too rushed and precise.  The story definitely has promise, however, and I intend to continue along with Runa on her journey.",3,0,1188,0.17,0
545,"I gave this 3 stars for a genius book title, a good beginning and a good ending.  The middle of the story was lacking - I wanted what the title promised, some strong Southern women banding together to fight a vampire.  I wanted some humor, some horror and a lot of fun in the story.  But the middle was just.......sad.  The women acted like it was the 1950's and all they were good for was cleaning house and deferring to their husbands (who were idiots).  It took them 3 YEARS!!!!! to do anything - all the while ignoring clues.  I mean is it normal for a bunch of killer rats to get into someone's house and eat their mother-in-law, her caregiver and the dog?  Wouldn't you at the very least call animal control to report this?  Is it normal to be attacked by a feral old lady who bites off your ear?  It is normal for her nephew to have some sort of strange condition where he can't go out during the day and Patricia (being a nurse and all) just accepts unnamed condition as true?

546,"I grew up with Andy Warhol as a cultural icon, but I didn't really know much about him.  Also, I am a big fan of Lou Reed and I was curious how they got to know each other and about their relationship.  After all, Reed (along with John Cale) made a memorial album for Warhol after his death, I figured there had to be some close connection.I was disappointed on both points.  Well, I did learn a lot about Warhol and the people around him, but it seemed mostly superficial.  I don't understand him any better, and I never got a strong impression that the author understood him either.On the positive side, the book contains a wealth of information about the New York art scene in the fifties and sixties.  This would be a great book for an art history class, with its many references to people and places.On the other hand, Warhol's homosexuality seemed to be the true emphasis of the book, with almost every reference to Warhol or his art pointing out how gay he or his art was.  That seemed to be the primary interest the author had in Warhol, rather than his art.For me the book seemed way too long.  Too much trivia was included.  Maybe a good edit would have helped.",3,0,1171,0.177,0

The storm is erratic, meandering unpredictably and waxing and waning in intensity until it takes a sudden unexpected turn and hits Camino Island, leaving the resort a shell of its former self.And so it goes with Camino Winds, a disappointing follow up to the enjoyable Camino Island.  Our favorite small town bookseller, Bruce Cable, would certainly have had several suggestions for the author: Start by editing out the entire State Police plot line, then provide some more insight into the bad guys and their shady ways , and,finally, place the protagonist in some actual peril to create tension and interest  But, alas, such suggestions have gone unheeded and the book ambles along for the first two-thirds until the bad guys are handed over on a platter and the book is wrapped up in the matter of a few pages.Camino Winds feels like a mere place holder for an interesting cast of characters.  There is sure to be more to hear from in the future about now-famous Mercer Mann, felonious Bob Cobb, and Gen Z slacker/sleuth Nick Sutton and one does hope that Bruce Cable reverts from crusading do-gooder back to the morally ambiguous antihero that inhabited Camino Island.",2,0,1237,0.116,1
548,"4 1/2  ""xx"" Stars...It's hard to know exactly how to review You and Me and Us.  Quite simply, it's a beautiful book about the parts of life that can be downright ugly.  Ms. Hammer wrote a love story with multiple facets.  It deals with not only the romantic love between a man and woman, but also the love between a father and his daughter, a mother and her daughter and the love present between close friends.  It's loving someone else so much that you prioritize what is best for them ahead of what you want or need.  Even in the midst of everything though, people are human and selfishness creeps in no matter how much we try to battle it.  Sometimes, it blinds us to what the best options truly are in a certain situation because a person just can't see past their own personal desires.""You'll always be his daughter, he'll always be your dad.""You and Me and Us deals with saying goodbye to the man who is the glue in the family.  Tommy holds everything together.  Alexis has relied on him for as long as she's known him because he always had her back.  How will she move on without Tommy to smooth everything over for her and to keep things running well at home.  Alexis and her daughter, Cece have anything but an ideal relationship.  Cece has always been closer to Tommy.  As Alexis and Cece prepare to say goodbye to Tommy and learn to live without him, they also have to learn to rely on and trust one another.""I remember he told me that some things in life were worth sticking around for, and that things would be hard wherever I went.  So he told me I should stay and work through the tough parts to get to the good ones.""You and Me and Us was a well-written women's fiction that chronicled the long goodbye to a loved one with cancer while helping the soon to be survivors figure out how to relate to one another again.  There weren't any surprise twists and nothing catchy, it was just straight forward beautiful words that pulled you into this family's story.  I was so engrossed that I really felt their anguish.  Their time with Tommy was a blessing but at times it was also tortuous because they knew what was coming.

Harriet practices herbal magic while Frances practices a darker type of magic.  Harriet is a healer and uses her magic wisely, while her cousin Frances uses her magic to get what she wants - a husband who has money and now she wants her step-daughter, Annis, to marry a man with a title to place her in a position to join the elite 400 in New York.Annis is also descended from from the Bishop line, but knows nothing about her abilities.

554,"Beneath the Summer Sun by Kelly Irvin is the 2nd in the An Every Amish Season series.  In this novel Jennie Troyer has been a widow for 4 years and is no closer to trusting herself in picking a man to be her life partner nor her children's new father.  In her first marriage she thought she was so in love with the best man ever when she married Atlee and Atlee had yelled at her and told her she was clumsy or stupid and sometimes that was worse than when he physically abused her or made her sleep in the barn.  Sometimes she could figure out what made him mad but many times it seemed that he just flew off the handle and she never could figure out why.  When he died in an accident she felt guilty that she was relieved but that didn't make her sorry that he was gone.  In the Amish faith when a person makes a vow to be married it is for life and there is no way out unless God releases you.  The Amish believe that if your spouse dies that if possible the widow should quickly remarry and ""get on with life"".  Her best friend Bess was getting ready to marry her first husband's best friend and was quite happy about it but Jennie was no closer to remarriage than the day that Atlee died.In her community were 2 men who thought differently, Nathan, a Mennonite man and Leo Graber an Amish man who had caught her eye before she married Atlee but now seemed to have renewed interest in Jennie.  Atlee had been kind and loving before they married but by 6 months was already mistreating her, so how did she know that Nathan or Leo wouldn't do the same thing?  She now had 7 children to think of not just herself.  Could Jennie ever learn to trust God and man again?  Both of the men interested in her seemed to have problems that they needed to overcome in the trust game also. How could she work on trusting herself and help them learn to trust also?  If she did learn to trust these men how could she choose between them?  Read this book to find out if Jennie ever learns to live the life that God intended her to have.I liked reading this book and think that any woman would also enjoy it unless the issue of domestic violence hits too close to home.

I'm on page 85, and have given up hope that there is any reason at all to keep reading.  The book is written in the driest sense with not much more than a recitation of facts.  It's written about each person, one at a time, so the timeline is confusing when it switches to another family member for the purpose of, in the most boring way possible, listing the events of their life.  I also have to say that when the author got to JFK and opted to quote ungentlemanly items he wrote to another male friend about a hospital stay he had, I was revolted by the choice to include that.  Completely unnecessary and not at all germane to the story.  That's about page 85, by the way, and the point when I tossed it (yes, actually tossed it) off to the side with disgust at the waste of money, and the author's waste of opportunity.Don't waste your time with this one - it's awful.

While our school kept up with reading and math assignments and writing assignments were done over apps, handwriting fell to the wayside.  It is a struggle to get my kids to sit and write anything - stories, comics, sentences, lists.  This book has helped us find ways for them to be comfortable, figure out what's making them tired/frustrated, and also gives them the power to help themselves.This guide starts with a quiz for the kids to determine where they may have difficulties.  Then it includes exercises, tips, strategies, and recommendations for each writing-learning style.  There are progress charts!  An appendix full of reminders and templates!  Like I said, this is written for kids (but also for parents!).I will recommend this book to all my friends with children who need help with their writing.  This is a strange time we live in and our homes are not the same as schools.  But this book will help us get through whatever distance learning is in our future.*I was provided an e-book copy for review by NetGalley.  All opinions are my own.*",5,0,1250,0.096,0
559,"I just finished this book which, I believe, is ground breaking in our understanding of Race Relations in this nation today and how African Americans view their place in American Society and Government.  It is also a reexamination of the writing of James Baldwin and his role in Civil Rights Movement of the mid 20th Century.  Professor Glaude has challenged me to read and learn much more about James Baldwin which I realize that I am sorely lacking.  I believe this is true of most White Americans and especially is true of the current Administration of Donald Trump.  His mantra of “Make America Great Again” is a naive euphemism of “Make America White Again” and has continued to deny the divisive impact his policies has had on the suffering of racial bigotry for people of color in this country.  These are Americans Citizens whom he swore to protect and defend when he took his oath of office.  The President also refuses to admit the presence of “White Privilege” in almost every aspect of American life and what is more egregious  is not using the influence of his office to push back against this immoral and unAmerican attitude.  If we try to convince ourselves that Constitutional Government as it envisioned in the late 18th Century made the United States an exceptional nation, we deceive the world community in what democratic government ought to be.  Jeffersonian ideals of life, liberty and equality as well as the Madisonian ideal of separation of power with its belief in checks and balance failed with the outbreak of the American Civil War.  If there was a second awakening with the passage of the 13th, 14th and 15th Amendments, it was shown to be a failure with the end of Reconstruction and the introduction of the Jim Crow Era with the election in 1878 of Rutherford B. Hayes.  The Assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr. in 1968 turned our nation inward and away from social justice for all Americans.  Let’s be hopeful that our nation is experiencing a new Epiphany and Renaissance as a free people showing our rejection of authoritarianism and nations that want to see an end to democratic government in the United States.  Be sure to vote in November to bring an end to tyranny and replace it with a government which cares about American lives.",5,0,2273,0.113,1
560,"It all started for me with a Vageode cake - a story on social media, and the author, Abby Jimenez, reacting to the comments on her bakery's geode cake done in a pale shade of pink.  Her spunk and snark are what drew me to follow her, and prompted me to buy her first published rom-com, The Friend Zone, when it came out.  And it just keeps getting better with her 2nd one!The Happy Ever After Playlist is more heartfelt, sweet, entertaining, and gut-wrenching than TFZ.  The main character, Sloan, is a wonderfully developed leading lady - just enough perfection mixed with humanity and flaws to be relateable.  The leading man sounds honestly like what we hope every country singer actually is, so perhaps not exactly totally quite realistic.....however, it IS a romance and he's NOT absolutely perfect, so it really works within the story's confines.  Plus appearances from some of our favorite characters from TMZ.  My only regret is I want more....I want more about Jason's family and their relationships with Sloan, more about Kristen and Josh and their growing family, more about all of the characters.

562,"3-4 stars.  This was not at all what I expected, not even sure I would consider it a real mystery, but with that said I did find it very well written, intriguing, and very much an important part of today’s current themes.  It really is one of those that I would consider beautifully written, but very slow burning and multilayered.  The characters development was amazing and the plot really fits with many of the things you would see in today’s headlines and other areas.  It may have some triggers, so if you are one that is easily triggered, not into feminist type stories, or looking for a thriller/mystery with tons of twists & turns, thrills, chills, and shocks it’s not likely for you, but if you do enjoy beautifully written, slow paced, feminist stories, which definitely use current events then you need to grab a copy today!  Overall, I think if you are into multilayer books, which use important social, political, and other current themes, then you will definitely enjoy this book!

564,"This book is really informative and makes you think.  However, it isn't what I expected.  I expected a review of what digs have found about cities and their development over the centuries, with a good smattering of graphics and pics.  This is not that book.  This book is an analysis of what the author believes the evidence shows was necessary for the development of cities, i.e. the psychological and sociological changes within the human species to make urban dwelling possible and even desirable over the hunter-gatherer lifestyle that preceded the development of cities.  She begins with the ""first"" true city around 6000 BCE.  But completely dismisses places like Jericho, Çatalhöyük, Göbekli Tepe, and on and on.  There is literally almost no mention of these historic sites, nor their impact or role in the development of urbanization.  All that being said, if you are looking for the socio-economic and psychological-physiological changes that led to urban living . . . then this IS the book for you.  It is well written and was interesting in its analysis.  It just really isn't what trips my trigger in the ancient history of humanity.",4,1,1146,0.085,1
565,"American Catholics maneuvers on multiple levels as a history book.  Although it provides the data & stats that one would expect on the history of its topic, it is not a top down survey with a routine historical trajectory.  Its historical review builds upon the foundation of where history actually happens – on the human level.  The book's meticulously researched details are brilliantly woven through the people who give personality to something that might readily be described by default as an institutional history.  As enormous as the Roman Catholic Church is – it is an establishment that humans built, for better or worse, a reflection of humanity.The book is not just about the Roman Church.  It is specifically about the Roman Church of America.  However, it sews the threads of precedence from Europe into a refashioned American form of Catholicism.  For example, the effects of each immigrant wave had an amalgamating outcome on the American Roman Church, a hybrid not previously known in Europe (which is not to say it was a smooth transition).  The preexisting cultural diversity and separation played out here in America which is quite interesting to note in juxtaposition to the common perception of an early ""freedom of religion"" ethos in this land.The growth of the RC Church in America was driven, severely driven, by individuals who quite apparently believed in something far greater than themselves.  Their energy did not recognize discouragement or dissipate under conditions that could lead to despair.  One can admire the lack of self-pity among those pursuing their vision of the church which did not allow them to be dissuaded by human vulnerabilities such as, ""Resentment, that most isolating of emotions."" (P. 159)  That said, the author does not disguise the pain the Church inflicted.  The documentation explores early European hegemony and dominance of the first residents of this land.  Midway, attitudes toward slavery and women are addressed.  The book ends with reviewing the latest revelations of sexual abuses by priests along with reactions and corresponding cover-ups.  An objective history does not favor the good or the not-so-good.  In that, this book maintains the scope of impartial scholarship.  As told, the human stories resemble an ethnography relying on words of those living in the time to describe their experiences and perceptions.  From there, the reader can apply personal affect on those experiences & perceptions.It's likely that anyone who finds American history interesting will find this book highly informative, even in some surprising ways.  Much of American culture relates to, or emanates from, the RC Church.  Religion is interactive, influencing & influenced by, all facets of culture.  The author skillfully places another important piece in the mosaic of American development.  She finishes the writing on a personal note.  Dr. Tentler reveals how she has maintained a sense of what the church means in her life despite its idiosyncrasies.My pleasure in reading American Catholics was augmented by the fact that I was once a student of Dr. Tentler's (SY 1976 – 77).  I trusted her scholarship and insights back then, and still do today.  Teaching on the college level over the years, I have often relied upon what I learned in her class.  That is, quality teaching goes far beyond acquiring and dispensing substantive information.  It needs to personify a genuine investment and care for students as well.  Professor Tentler has been a great example.",5,0,3516,0.096,1
566,"I don't really know where to start with this one on what our thoughts are other than saying that although we didn't hate it we didn't love it either.For us as a whole we really enjoyed the characters with their camaraderie and their love and loyalty to one another and we loved that most of them had really great personalities that made them engaging because characters like Skylar were a hoot.I liked Temper and Abbie but, here again didn't love them.I loved the fact that we saw a different side of Temper when he was with Abbie and we loved how easily Abbie fit right into the club and won over the men and women of the club so easily as they had her back and she theirs.For me Temper and Abbie lacked chemistry and passion and this story lacked a whole lot of heat.I have no problem with a slow burning romance but, you couldn't even call this that because their so called love affair was just getting started and boom their already in love.Temper and Abbie made a cute couple and we loved seeing Abbie's personal growth with being in a different environment and even making new friends and even with Temper's influence but, there was no burn between this couple at least for me and where was all Temper's so called alpha-ness ? hummmm""I didn't feel it or see it !""Overall this story was slow and boring and a bit confusing or you could so had ""no rhyme or reason with certain parts of the story"" because the story started out one way and that is how this couple ended up together with a situation gone a rhy.At one point its unclear of who has a beef with the club is it another MC or someone else?As the story progresses the story goes in a whole other direction for a bit but, is still connected to the original plot in some way but ,with a whole lot of surprises turning up in the mix but, I am left with a bunch of unanswered questions and a bunch of why's ? Certain things just didn't make sense....This story is part of a ongoing plot of vengeance or payback or what ever you want to call it that spills over into this book and for someone like me just coming in their is certain previous background which is important to the mindset of certain characters in this book so my suggestion for other readers is to read the series in order first.",3,0,2252,0.185,0
567,"Adult Contemporary Realistic Fiction.  I was pulled to this book by its title-- I'm always interested in anything to do with redheads.  Though this story actually didn't, as the title refers to a trick of the eye when the main character sees a fire hydrant without his glasses on.  Micah is a middle-aged man who lives comfortably in his basement apartment.  He manages the building that he lives in and also runs a mobile tech service ""Tech Hermit.""  He is in a relationship with Cass, a teacher, and pretty much keeps to himself otherwise.  But then a young man named Brink shows up at his door.  Brink is the son of a college girlfriend, who erroneously thinks Micah is his father.  Though Micah is not, he still gets pulled into the drama of Brink's life.  Cass is facing a potential eviction, and Micah's life all of a sudden gets thrown out of whack.This is a character-driven novel, with limited action.

569,"I have been a fan of author, podcaster, humorist, truth teller, speaker Jen Hatmaker for almost a decade.  I started following her on Facebook, then discovered her books, listened to every single “For the Love” podcast, and somehow as a fan, was selected as part of the advanced launch team to read an e-copy of her newest book, “Fierce, Free, and Full of Fire”.In her newest book, Jen shares from her heart all the life lessons she has learned. She challenges us, no matter our ages, to take a look at our own lives in the same ways.  She has five bigger categories, “Who I Am, What I Need, What I Want, What I Believe, and How I Connect”  and through the 12 subjects within those, helps us discover our own truest, freest selves.  In the introduction she says, “I discovered the world is hungry for women who show up and tell the truth, unafraid and free, expanding to the very edges of who they were always meant to be.”Jen writes with transparency, honesty, and touches of her natural humor, using stories from her life and childhood and backed up with solid research and references.  She teaches us, more so than in her last few books, to fully recognize that we are “literally created by love, with love, and for love by a God who loves us and is Love itself…..it’s for all of us.”  In her chapters we learn we are enough, fully interwoven in all our parts, that we deserve goodness, we can ask for help, that we all need more connection, we can pursue our dreams and choose our yeses.  That we can be spiritually curious and believe in justice and our causes with a passion.  That we can connect with honesty and without drama.  In all of this, we can teach our daughters and the next generations some of these lessons so they can be that further ahead in their personal growth.I would recommend this book to all ages of women who are Jen Hatmaker fans, and to all of you who are just learning about her.  If you are looking to fully know who you are (even if you thought you knew!), as personal as some chapters may feel, she is walking right through this with you with some laughs along the way.

570,"This is best example of not judging a book by its cover I've ever had.  The cover led me to believe this was a typical romance story of a couple that stopped speaking.  I imagined scenes of pots and pans clanging in a small apartment as they made noise during this silence.I was wrong.  Completely wrong.The story of Maggie and Frank was anything but typical.  It was an amazing story of marriage - the challenges, the memories, the losses, the tenderness.  All of it that unveils itself over the course of decades between two people, yet feels solid and complete as if built like that from the ground up.  Anyone whose been in a marriage of many years, enough to have felt the swings of boredom and chaos, children and job, in-laws and family dynamics knows that a marriage isn't built from a how-to guide.  It's delicate and vulnerable.  It's an invisible bond of endurance between two people.  Whose hair grays and faces wrinkle.  Whose shared love of their children and their togetherness are all that matter in the end.This beautiful story isn't a thriller or a fast-paced dramatic rendition.

I liked the introduction and hearing about the author's motivation and point of view.  I also thought her H.O.N.E.S.T system was interesting and I can see myself referring back to it  and the chapter about my type quite often.  In the chapter on my type, the author did an excellent job providing concrete examples and she gave solid advice.  Her writing truly shows her compassion and enthusiasm for the topic and you can tell she put a lot of thought into the book.  My two complaints is twofold: I didn't feel like the book gave enough details about the Enneagram system or what it is.  I especially felt like more explanation could have been given about the 'wings'.  I can see why the author might not want to have included that information so my second complaint is that I wish she would have given additional resources that readers could seek out.

572,"The first 30 minutes of this audio book reads like an Op-ed.  As the plot takes shape, the author takes on a scholarly preachy tone.  North Dakotans take a hit with the dismissive descriptors.  The book’s two main characters become completely unlikeable as they deliver their condescending appraisals.  And maybe it’s the audio book that sets this tone.  It’s not a very inviting start.  But, if you can get past the first 30 minutes, the story gets back on track and settles into an action-packed delivery.  The mystery grows and two things stand out:  a ton of characters, and a ton of plot twists.  I don’t think there is one missed opportunity for a misdirection.  This is that book you grab for a plane trip.  It offers rapid-fire entertainment but is easily forgotten, mediocre in quality.  The writing centers on story filler, a ton of action held together by a slim thread of character development.  Also not great, this series is veering away from its initial “perfect memory” premise.

Our hero, Garrett, is a seafarer, looking to settle down, although he doesn’t know it until he meets the heroine, Julia.  She is a widow, severely under the thumb of her over bearing father-in-law, and trying to escape.  Their initial meeting in the park is a “meet-cute” for the books, and had me captivated.  The story developed a bit slowly, but I really liked the way Garrett’s attraction to Julia was portrayed.  Julia was a little harder to connect with, as she wasn’t trusting of Garrett’s actions and words, yet talked about escaping her father-in-law’s tyranny.  I felt like we kept building to a big showdown with the father-in-law that kind of fizzled instead of being a grand finale.  As with the initial meeting, there were several great, lighthearted scenes that made the book a pleasure to read.  I also liked the set up with Brina’s situation for the third book.

579,"As I’ve mentioned in other reviews of Liz Talley’s novels, she has a gift for creating flawed, fascinating, and memorable characters.  The two main characters here are Melanie and Tennyson, who grew up as best friends and later became enemies after Tennyson trashed Melanie’s wedding by publically revealing a family secret.  It is now two decades after Melanie’s wedding to Tennyson’s ex-boyfriend, Kit, and Melanie’s daughter and Tennyson’s son Andrew are engaged.  This engagement forces Melanie and Tennyson together, despite the obvious antipathy between the two women.As Melanie struggles with her floundering marriage and dissatisfaction with her life, Tennyson likewise struggles with her own identity, and facing up to the havoc she wrecked upon Melanie’s family. Given the extent and consequences of Tennyson’s betrayal, I probably could not forgive Tennyson.  However,  I understand Melanie’s recognition that her life is better with Tennyson in her life, and Melanie’s subsequent need for forgiveness and moving on.Some reviews complained about the unlikability of Melanie and Tennyson.  Whether or not characters are likable is not important to me.  What is important to me is whether or not I can engage with the characters, and Liz Talley excels in creating the clashing characters of Melanie and Tennyson.  This point was driven home to me as I was reading the scene where Melanie, her daughter Emma, and Tennyson go to Dallas to pick out Emma’s wedding dress.  I don‘t really care about the details of wedding dresses, nor do I know anything about designers, but I realized I enjoyed this scene because I cared about these two characters and their interaction.Finally, some reviews slammed the book for not being a romance nor a romantic comedy.  This book, while humorous in places, is not a romance nor a romantic comedy. (Note there is a romantic element between Tennyson and a younger cop) Unfortunately, some sites (NetGalley, Goodreads, and BookBub) identified The Wedding War as a romance, and even a romantic comedy.  Given that characterization, I understand the reviewers’ dislike of the book.  However, as a women’s fiction book (which the book clearly is), this novel is excellent.

Anyone from Blue States or Red States over the age of 10 who is reading this book can go deeply into the question of ""who was this unique person before she assumed the role that others placed on her"" and catch a glimpse of what it means to understand the humanity of ""Mom,"" celebrate her multi-faceted journey in life, and begin to forgive her many imperfections.  Our society has not yet fully honored the new possibilities of how a Mom can express and explore all the parts of who she is--this easy-to-read book can help in that direction.  --Leonard Felder, PhD  author of ""The Dilemma of the 21st Century Male:  Choosing Each Day Between Retro and Forward""",5,0,1141,0.129,1
581,"Little secrets that are actually HUGE secrets can destroy marriages and lives.  Marin is Christmas shopping in Pike Place Market with her 4 year old son Sebastian.  As they walk along, Marin gets into a text conversation with her husband Derek.  Suddenly, Sebastian is no longer at her side.  Despite efforts of people in the crowd and the police, no trace of Sebastian is found.  All that can be seen on security footage is Sebastian walking out of the market with Santa Claus  eating his favorite sucker.  The story picks up sixteen months later.  Marin is, of course, devastated.  At one point she even tried to commit suicide.  Marin relies on her closest, dearest friend, Sal, to help her through his.  Marin and Derik are drifting apart.  Marin spends her days working, attending a support group and talking to Sal.  Derek has found his own way to cope.  He has started an affair with McKenzie.  But McKenzie has her own agenda.  She is a “professional dater” and plans to use Derek for her own gain.  As the book goes forward all the stories converge into an unexpected ending.

582,"This was a pretty good story, centered around Shea, a police officer going undercover as a college student to try to solve the mystery around the disappearance of 3 girls.  Shea must connect with their friends and family in order to figure out what really happened.The storyline itself was good and I actually didn't figure out the twist until the end- I thought I had it the whole way through and there was a time where it seemed that I was right, only to be fooled later when the truth came out.On the downside, I did feel that the pace of the book was fairly slow, and there was some inane or unnecessarily  dialogue that just didn't need to be there.  I also thought it was a little too easy for Shea to ingratiate herself with the key players in the story, almost immediately becoming best friends with the clique in which the missing girls were a member, and starting a relationship with the brother of one of them.Overall, I liked the story and am glad I read the book.  I would be interested in reading more from this author.  Thanks to Netgalley for providing me a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.",3,0,1125,0.185,1
583,"I was a bit disappointed by this book.  Although part of the title says “Buck Trammel Western”, Buck Trammel is almost like a supporting character in most of the story.  It begins with Buck as a bouncer working in a saloon in Wichita.  A gambler named Adam Hagen is accused of cheating and a bar fight ensues.  Buck and Adam are run out of town by Deputy Wyatt Earp, because the dead guys Buck just killed are rancher VIP’s.  Buck is a former NYC copper and Pinkerton agent (with a secret), so he’s not savvy on how to survive in the wild, Wild West.  It just felt like Adam overshadowed Buck with his dominating personality.  Buck is portrayed like a big giant ( 6’ 5”) of a man who doesn’t know his own strength.  Adam is portrayed as a guy who is his protector.  It almost reminded me of George and Lennie In John Steinbeck’s “Of Mice and Men”.The story is interesting with bar fights and some gun action.  However, none of it could pull the book to a 5 stars.  I really hope the next in the series will have Buck as more of a main character.  I probably will read the next one out of curiosity.",3,0,1098,0.083,1
584,"I voluntarily read and reviewed an advance copy of this book.  All thoughts and opinions are my own.Sugar and Vice, by Eve Calder, is available at booksellers on 4-28-2020.  Sugar is book 2 in Ms Calder's A Cookie House Mystery series.  It's my 1st experience with this author and I like the way she writes.  There's a nice style and flow to the story.  The characters are fleshed out, secondary characters have a little substance too, which makes them interesting.  Although book 2 in a series Sugar and Vice works just fine as a stand-alone.  There are references to the 1st mystery but not enough to be a bother and cause confusion.The plot of finding a skeleton and thinking it's ancient is a nice way of bringing an island lore into the story, mixing an old story with a current crime scene.  One investigation blends with the other and both are eventually solved.  The food all sounds delicious and I'd have liked a recipe or 2, my mouth watered at the description of the cookies.  In my humble opinion the best and most interesting character is Oliver, the dog.  He's absolutely perfect.#EveCalder  #SugarAndVice  #ACookieHouseMystery  #Netgalley  #StMartin'sPaperbacks  #cullinarymystery",4,0,1195,0.149,0
585,"Lady Diana Seaton has been warned by her abusive father that she should keep her mouth shut and look pretty.  He will arrange a marriage for her to one of his friends, even though he is old enough to be Diana’s grandfather!  Then, her father can get his hands on her large trust fund left to her by her grandmother.  If she refuses, he will send her infant nephew to an orphanage.  Diana can’t let that happen as she promised her sister as her sister was dying that she would take care of the baby.  Diana has never known a man who wasn’t abusive, mean or out to get something from her.  After her presentation to the Queen of England, her father’s plans for her marriage are foiled, but at what cost?Evan Eldridge is recovering from a war wound in an English hospital.  He is having panic attacks, flashbacks and memory loss, but he mustn’t let anyone know or he won’t be able to rejoin his regiment and may be confined to a mental hospital.  He knows there is something important that he must remember about the day he got wounded, but his mind won’t let him remember what.  He gets a niggling feeling and is on the verge of remembering, but then he is distracted or interrupted, and the ghost of a thought goes away.  He receives surprising news while in the hospital.  This news will change his circumstances.  He meets the Prince Regent who has other ideas for Evan’s future.  Can Evan keep his problems a secret?I loved this story!  I was drawn in from beginning to end.  The characters are easy to get to know and care about.  I enjoyed the interaction between Louisa and Mr. Strand where they clashed with humor and vigor.  Evan’s experience with what now is PTSD and his fears of being thought crazy were realistic as well as Diana’s abuse at the hands of her father and brother.  Both characters carried secrets into their unexpected marriage and their inability to fully trust one another led to problems, but they could see God at work and were able to resolve their trust issues once they fully trusted Him.  I am anxiously awaiting book two in the series, The Gentleman Spy, due to be released on 7/28/20.  Regency romance readers will really like this story, and even if you aren’t a Regency romance aficionado, I still recommend getting a copy for a great read!",5,0,2277,0.169,1
586,"It's hard to know what to write about this dual time line coming of age story of mothers, daughters, horses, and betrayal except that it's an amazing read.  You know going in that there's going to be a horrible fire in 1993 but not why or how.  Rory,  fifteen at the time, helps her stepfather Gus at the barn and takes photos in her spare time until she was wrapped into the world of rich kids, June, Wade, and Vivian.  Her mother Mona is never really present.  Vivian lives with her mother Sara and little brother Charlie.  When Charlie is killed, Sara takes off and Vivian spins out.  In 2015, Rory's daughter is helping Gus with his ranch in Wyoming but she's aching for Rory, now a war photographer.  You'll learn something about horses and horsebreeding, as well as the cruelties that can go along.  There's a lot of tragedy here and sadness but the novel is beautifully written with incredible characters.  You won't like all of them- Wade figures large on that end of things- and you might grow to dislike others as the story proceeds but you will always find them believable.

As Brad states, and it is a very well-known concept to my family because I am childhood cancer survivor, knowing how or when to ask for help, for those who are self-sufficient by their own resources, is a challenging concept to comprehend, especially when you have an immediate loved one who is going through a tragic medical situation.

For me, I never knew there were all of these organization available to help others in need just in the immediate area of Philadelphia.  Once I began this book, I was unable to put it down.

589,"Little Secrets is another masterpiece from Jennifer Hillier.  It’s described as a domestic suspense tale or a psychological thriller, but it’s so much more.  As with all of Hillier’s books, it’s a fast-paced, heart-pounding, pulse-racing story that reveals something you didn’t expect on every page, which means you can’t stop turning pages and once you pick it up you can’t put it down.The worst day of Marin Machado’s life happened almost a year and a half ago.  Her four-year old son Sebastian was kidnapped from Seattle’s Pike Place Market.  Of course she blames herself:  it was the holiday, busy, crowded, Seb was whining for candy, she was harried, looking for gifts and looking at her phone.  She and her husband took all measures to try and find Seb, but postings, newspaper ads, offer of rewards, nothing worked and Seb is gone.  And the perfect life, perfect marriage, perfect careers, perfect family is gone.  Marin can’t move on although everyone, tells her to do so, and she hires a private investigator to pick up where the police left off, gave up in her estimation.And the investigator has news.  But not the news Marin wants or expects.  Derek, her beloved husband of 20 years, is having an affair.  With a much younger woman.  Talk about betrayal, the final straw, the thing she just can’t deal with.  But maybe she can.  She is impotent to do anything about Seb’s disappearance, but she’s not powerless to do something about this.  Despair turns to rage.  She will get rid of that woman. She’s not going to lose everything.  So she sets things in motion.And we’re off.  To say much more would spoil the story.  Nothing, nothing, nothing is certain.  Just when you think you’ve found that one person that can be trusted or that one scenario that is true, an aha moment pops up and all those little hints you missed fall into place and you wonder why you didn’t see it.  Now you know.  But then it happens again – and again.  Until you can hardly bear the suspense.Little Secrets is a wild ride.  Strong plot, fast pace, riveting characters, a flood of emotions.  You’ll feel Marin’s hurt and betrayal, Derek’s helplessness and hopelessness, Marin’s friend Sal’s frustration and Derek’s lover Kenzie’s ambition and hope.I received an advance copy of Little Secrets from the author via NetGalley.

592,"When I read a summary of the plot, it sounded like something Dame Agatha Christie might have written: amateur sleuth outfoxes the professionals and solves the crime.We met the characters in an earlier book.  The setting - an island in Florida - was a fun escape during this pandemic.  The plot was pretty fresh and entertaining.  One of the writers on the island dies of unnatural causes during a hurricane.  The local cops are incompetent and busy with the destruction after a hurricane, so mystery authors work to uncover who done it.That part was like Christie.  As the story unfolded, Grisham's storytelling style dominated.  Amateur sleuths unearth that the motive for the killing is complex and involves trips off the island and a tangled web.At times the plot seemed a tad choppy - but the action moved fast and I was grateful for that.  If you like Grisham, I think you'll enjoy this diversion.  Grisham offers some thoughts on being a writer throughout the story.  It's obvious that Grisham thinks that one has to be willing to work hard to be a best-selling author.  I enjoyed his insights on that.",4,0,1108,0.153,1
593,"I am no literary expert, but I do have some firm ideas about life stories.  Biography is generally written for profit and concerns an important person or celebrity.  Autobiography is written by the subject themselves, when not ghost written, and is likewise motivated by profit.  Memoir is like those in kind but can differ in a very important way.  Memoir may be written by people who one does not ordinarily think of as “important” or a celebrity.Memoir, in my view, should have a few characteristics.  First, it should have a specific purpose.  Second, the subject of the memoir should “come alive” in the reading.  The reader should feel they know the writer personally.  Third, there should be a story arc the reader can understand and draw lessons from.  A memoir is something more than just one thing after another.  Fourth, a memoir should be limited in nature, the readers do not need an “ashes to ashes” telling of the subject’s life story.  Finally, for me, memoir should have a pacing that allows for reflection by the reader, as the memoir is being read.  I do not mean to say the pacing should be “slow,” but certainly not frenetic.I have just finished reading, twice, Ed Kressy’s beautifully written memoir My Addiction and Recovery: Just Because You Are Done With Drugs, Doesn’t Mean Drugs Are Done With You. [I added the colon] First, Ed’s memoir has a specific purpose.  Primarily, Ed is telling his story to give other drug addicts a very important insight that there is hope of a sober life after even years of serious drug addiction.  Secondarily, Ed’s story also signals to all people struggling with persistent problems, be it unemployment, incarceration, or simply overcoming a blighted childhood, there is hope, one can change.  We do not have to remain hostage to our past mistakes.  Second, Ed completely inhabits the memoir with his personality and inner most thoughts, feelings, and self-recriminations.  Third, Ed certainly presents a definite story arc.  Although Ed reveals some early childhood memories, his tale is largely that of an adolescent coming of age with drugs and alcohol, and how he overcomes the resulting addiction in his adulthood.  Fourth, Ed limits his story.  Ed does not bog the reader down in an exhaustive biography describing every jot and tittle of his entire life.  Rather, Ed focuses on coming of age, becoming an independent moral agent, and finally, coming to terms with drug fueled years of denying his moral agency.  Last, Ed delivers supurb pacing.  I was nearly unable to put this book down, through both readings.  A true “page turner.”  Yet Ed’s pacing left time to anticipate, as well as dread, the twist and turns in his life. Time enough also to reflect on the momentum of his life story as it moved from episode to episode.In short, Ed bares his soul and reveals his inner most thoughts, fears, and regrets.  Ed demonstrates a courage and transparency rarely seen, even in these enlightened times. He is candid about his methamphetamine induced psychosis, and its lingering effects after years of sobriety.  Few among us speak so bravely and candidly of their own mental illness.  Ultimately, Ed delivers a message of hope to those who will listen.  All of us can overcome our most grievous mistakes.  All of us are worthy of redemption.  All of us may find peace, but only if we are honest with ourselves, and others, about the true nature of our discomforts: the propensity for human frailty we all share.",5,0,3477,0.141,0
594,"""The Southern Book Club's guide to slaying vampires had so much promise and a great description going for it.  Alas, to me it fell short of its promises to the reader.Patricia Campbell, the main female character; becomes a member of a true crime book club after the old fashioned classic based book club she is in fizzles out.  Slowly, she comes to realize that a new neighbor James Harris is (possibly) a vampire, and is praying on elderly people in the area (and of children of the nearby town).  Set on killing the vampire that has attacked her family and other people around her in various ways, she becomes intent on having help from her book club in killing the menace.This is set in Charleston, SC  in the Mt. Pleasant Old Village area (and other parts around town) and has the feel in some ways of a Southern book-a stay at home Mom, a cranky Mother in Law who talks about the Old South, a non-attentive Husband, and social class and social norms in an area known for properness and manners.  One of the reason I did end up giving this book 3 stars is due to all of the historic areas  and events mentioned in the area that are familiar to me-Alhambra Hall, Boone Hall, Middleton Plantation and to those of you from SC-the Carolina Clemson game (this game actually is part of an integral part of the book).  However, the characters are not likable, at all.  The main character Patricia wines a lot and complains about her Husband and children, and they just don't come across as that bad.  The other female characters are not well drawn and are not distinctive.  It is almost a relief  when another character  who is pivotal to the story dies.  The plot is basically nonexistent.  The book sets up a lot that sounds interesting in the first half, and it only gets worse from there.This book was definately a horror book-there are many horror elements, and this is not an Anne Rice vampire at all.  I was expecting a Charlaine Harris type book (Sookie Stackhouse series turned into the HBO ""True Blood"" series)  with lots of funny parts and clearly drawn characters with interesting situations and I did not get that at all.  Even the book club meetings are disappointing.I can't recommend this book.  I gave this three stars rather than one because of the setting of Charleston, SC.",3,0,2290,0.09,1
595,"History Channel episodic chapters.The writing is exciting most of the time.  It comes at you in small doses and builds chronologically by topic.  These are clearly defined as the chapter names along with the numbers.The story is about Herbert Cukurs, a Latvian pilot, compared to Lindbergh, who at the end of WW2 is known as “The Butcher of Latvia”.  Tracking down Nazi war criminals was a frantic pursuit all across the globe due to a little known statute of limitations that was expiring in 1965.  This had a big impact on bringing Cukurs to justice and is part and parcel of this book and investigation.Author, Stephan Talty, has the ability to bring out the emotions and breathe life into the people he’s writing about; the history comes to life.

The story bounces among the three time frames of the deaths; 1952, 1972, and “present day”.I had some difficulty in the beginning getting into this story; did we really need an entire chapter on Clara giving birth?  And, while I did think the motive behind the killings was a bit of a stretch, I eventually found the book engrossing and well written.

599,"This is a personal account of how a theoretical physicist thinks and works; and it works.  It communicates clearly the remaining problems to be resolved in quantum mechanics and does a great job of explaining the difference between the anti-realist approach to quantum mechanics inherent in the Copenhagen interpretation and the realist approach inherent interpretations like pilot-wave theory.

In the final two chapters of the books he lays down three principles upon which a complete theory of quantum mechanics can attained and they are brilliant.

It seems that a duke’s passing has brought to light mysterious bequests which bring a fortune to three women.  These women have never heard of the duke, nor met him and know nothing about him or why he might have targeted them for his heirs.In this novel Minerva Hepplewhite has started a detective business that caters to women who have no way to conduct investigations, nor seek help from other detectives (men) since their gender prevents them from conducting such business.Chase Radnor is a detective, and the duke’s nephew, who has found Minerva to let her know of her inheritance.  Minerva has secrets and is petrified that those will come out if she accepts the inheritance.  She is being followed by an unsavory person who is trying to connect her with her previous husband’s death.  Chase and Minerva join together in finding his uncle’s murderer and Minerva’s skulker.  This makes for a delightful read.I received a Kindle copy of this book from NetGalley.com  in return for my honest review.",4,0,1154,0.086,0
604,"BREASTS AND EGGSI tried so hard to enjoy this book.  I betcha I started and restarted it over ten times.  I just couldn't find it in myself to enjoy this book.  It went nowhere for me -- and quickly.Our narrator is Natsu who lives in Tokyo.  Her sister, Makiko, and her niece, Midoiko, come for a visit.  Her sister is there for a consult on breast augmentation.  Her daughter, Midoiko, doesn't speak to the grown-ups in her life and is full of teenage angst and then some.  This book was mostly about the female body, breast augmentations, and reproduction.  Yawn.I skimmed through most of the book hoping for some action, some interest, something that would make me want to read.  However, this never happened.  It's a 432 page book and that's a lot of book when you are not enjoying.Other reviewers have had the same experience as me.  I hope I am not missing something vital in this book that would bring me entertainment and reading satisfaction.  Perhaps it was me just not able to get into this book and subject matter.I can't recommend personally, but if you are a lover of Japanese literature, perhaps this is something you would enjoy.

605,"This is a well made cookbook.  Not just the content, which is great, but the book itself.  The book is hardcover, sturdy, and quite big.I love all the techniques and tips in the book, not to mention the mouthwatering recipes.I use to watch ""America's Test Kitchen"" all the time on PBS, but I haven't seen it in awhile because I don't have my antenna hooked up anymore.  I always enjoyed the recipes and helpful techniques/ tips that they would do on the show.This book has sections.  The start of each section gives you a condensed technique in the right margin, with more in depth instructions in the writing.This book is great for different levels of cooking and such.  Some of the techniques I knew, but it's still helpful to have a reminder.  I like the explanation/origin that comes with each technique too.  Just like on the show when the host would give a little bit of background before they delved into the techniques and accompanying recipes.Honestly I'm quite pleased with this technique/cookbook.  I love the easy to understand techniques and I can't wait to try some of the recipes.  I just hope my cookbook shelf is sturdy enough for this book, haha.",5,0,1164,0.243,1
606,"I was so excited when I first heard that Jeffrey was putting out a cookbook.  He has been my go-to for Instant Pot cooking since I got my first pot a few years ago.  His videos and recipes demystify the whole pressure cooking experience.  I was so excited about getting my copy of this book, I accidentally bought it twice (a week apart).  I have given both copies to family members that are new to electric pressure cooking and now I need to go buy myself another copy to keep.  Before I relinquished my last copy, my 12-year old dubbed it ""Mommy's Kitchen Bible"" and started cooking from it.  She was able to easily follow along, thanks to the clear directions and wonderful photos of each and every step of the process.  Her dinners have been flawless!  Even her biggest critic was impressed: her little sister.  My only negative piece of feedback is the binding.  It would be much more user friendly if it were spiral bound and could lay flat on the counter.  I had to lay something heavy across the pages to keep it open while she cooked.  Jeffrey knocked it out of the park with his recipes, though.  Superb!!",5,0,1115,0.144,1
607,"David Sibley’s bird identification books for North America are considered by bird watchers as the best.  Not just good or good enough, but the BEST.David and his wife were on the National Geographic Explorer with us in 2018 on a trip to The Falkland Islands and South Georgia.  Soft spoken, modest guy.  He continues his life doing what was his passion since early childhood.  That is:  observing and drawing birds.  Information and art.  Based on hearing and observing him I think I can say that a near perfect day for him would be 6 hours watching and sketching every detail of a Scarlett Tanager eating elderberries followed by a an evening into night  adding color and finally arriving at the image in his vision.  As he explained, when he creates an image it is NOT a photo reproduction.  He captures the essence of a bird so that it is more recognizable to the beholder than either the real thing or a photo.This just published What It’s Like to Be a Bird is a break with Sibley’s past in that it is NOT a bird identification book.  It is NOT an ornithology text book.  Also, it is NOT a sit on the coffee table art book although the images are captivating.  It is a book meant to be held and read.  Just let it fall open and read and let the images speak to you.  And I pick it up again and again.  I have not bothered to add a bookmark.  I just go here and there.  Beautiful pictures and vignettes on bird biology.  What are the feather types? Why do bird heads  appear to bob?  How can Surf Scoters open and eat clams?  Who knew?The images will engage the attention of children from age 2 to 100 and beyond.  The age old wish to fly like a bird is still deep in our brains.  Yet there is much more to birds than just flying.The overall impression brings to my mind the last sentence in Darwin’s On the Origin of Species.  (Yes, it is a huge Victorian sentence!)  “There is grandeur in this view of life, with its several powers, having been originally breathed into a few forms or into one; and that, whilst this planet has gone cycling on according to the fixed law of gravity, from so simple a beginning endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful have been, and are being, evolved.”",5,0,2198,0.145,1

A power couple in Seattle with self made wealth, large home with all of the comforts money can buy, and a son, Sebastian, conceived after several rounds of IVF treatment. They are the portrait of happiness and success, until one fateful December day when Sebastian is taken from Marin's side at a busy Pikes Place Market while she is responding to a text from Derek.  Four minutes is all it took to steal a child.  A lollipop, Santa Suit, and two hundred and forty seconds.  In this short span of time the idyllic portrait of love and success is shattered.The story resumes 16 months after Sebastian is taken.  Lots of dead ends in investigations from the SPD and the FBI, both of which will keep the case ""open"" but as it ages have to refocus priorities on newer, current cases.  I won't say much more about the plot because I don't want to provide spoilers.Hillier has made a reputation of writing about dark, twisted people who do dark, twisted things.  I was excited to get a copy of Little Secrets after reading Jar of Hearts, a wildly successful book published in 2018.  Hillier's writing style speaks to me.  I enjoy her characters, prose, and all of the nooks and crannies that she visits during the telling of a story.  She has carved out a niche in the thriller genre and excels within the space.Little Secrets was a great book.  One of the things I like about the book are the three main characters all are flawed jerks.  They have very human traits and tendencies.  For some this may make some of their actions predictable, but I find the realism enticing and helpful in suspending my world for that of the story,  This book is edgy, with many twists and turns along the way.  Some of them I watched approach with the anticipation of riding the first hill of a roller coaster.  Others caught me by surprise, which is always a splendid experience.If you're looking for a good weekend read, that will captivate, enrage, and tug at heart strings all within the same chapters, then look no further.

The story is rich and the writing is good, very good.The trail to California is the backdrop for the beautiful love story between Naomi and John.  Their feelings start off shy, but grow into a deep and abiding thing that gets them through every tragedy and every joy.From the first page, this tale will draw you in.

611,"Series Info/Source: This is a stand alone book.  I got an eGalley of this book through NetGalley to review.Story (5/5): I really loved this book, it’s an excellent fantasy.  This was hard to put down and made for a very entertaining read. I also love that this is a complete story in a stand alone book, those are pretty rare in the fantasy genre.  The emperor has been killed and a new emperor cannot be crowned until the previous emperor’s reborn soul is found.  Meanwhile Tamra is just trying to make a living training students to race the kehok/monsters that are the bottom of where souls are reborn to.  Desperate to win the champion races Tamra purchases a metallic black lion kehok and hires Raia as a racer.  Rais is escaping a bad situation and desperate to find a way to make a living for herself.The story is very well put together, if a bit predictable.  I really enjoyed how entertaining it was and how well the story was woven together.  There is a good balance of action, world-building, intrigue, and character building.Characters (5/5): I loved the characters in this story.  Tamra is just such a determined woman and so practical.  Raia is desperate but willing to push herself in order to make her own way.  They are all admirable and easy to engage with.  Even the side characters are well developed and engaging.Setting (5/5):  This was an amazing fantasy world that was well thought out and developed.  I love the idea of people’s souls being reborn into animals based on how well they lived their previous life.  I also enjoyed that the world as a whole was pretty well fleshed out.Writing Style (5/5):  I love pretty much everything Durst writes so it’s no surprise I really loved this book as well.  The writing is well done, easy to read, and just flows beautifully.  The book does jump around between different POVs and that was masterfully done.  I think my only small quibble is how predictable this was from the very beginning.My Summary (5/5): Overall I really enjoyed everything about this book; the world, the characters, and the story.  I would highly recommend it if you are a fan of unique fantasy stories.  This was incredibly well done and I look forward to what Durst writes next!",5,0,2219,0.274,0
612,"This is a great read for our almost summer reading season.  I’d classify this a Women’s Fiction with a beachy feel.  The story is told in dual timelines of the 1951 version of Betty (Boop) Stern, and her 2017 version.We watch Boop navigate both time periods and understand how choices made by her family members, and herself helped to shape her future.  This is a story about family connections.  I enjoying learning about the Midwest ‘Catskills’ lake side resort in Michigan.  It’s where Betty grew up with her Jewish grandparents after having been abandoned by her parents.  I also appreciated how choices made that fateful summer when Boop was just eighteen, affected the rest of her life.  It also helped give her the wisdom as to how to answer a granddaughter’s plea for help during her own crisis.I enjoyed so many things about this book including the gorgeous cover.  This was such a lovely and relatable read about family, love, connections, and following your heart.‘Thank-You’ to NetGalley; the publisher, Lake Union Publishing; and the author, Amy Sue Nathan, for providing a free e-ARC copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.",4,0,1149,0.181,0

The shootout of thirty shots in thirty seconds took the lives of Billy Clanton and the brothers Tom and Frank McLaury.  Other characters in the book include  Ike Clanton, father of Billy, Kate Elder otherwise known as Big Nose Kate, the love of Doc Holliday, Johnny Ringo, Bat Masterson,  the numerous Earp brothers (Wyatt, Morgan, Virgil, James, and Warren), and other sleazy characters that make up a rip roaring western story that should keep the reader riveted.An interesting expression used at the time was ""skin it back"" which today would mean to take back what you said.

615,"I had no idea there was such a submarine, but found the story to be interesting.  I would have rather it be told more like a fictional story without as much of the engineering facts getting in the way.  I'm not saying that the feat of creating a working sub during the Civil War isn't fascinating and something I had never thought of, and I also understand the author is an engineer so it makes sense that in her quest to solve the mystery she is more scientific explanation rather than storyteller.  I guess the reader in me wanted more of a story - a novel's beginning, middle and end if that makes sense.  Those interested in historical facts will enjoy this book.  I'm only taking off a star because it could have been presented in such a way that a much larger group of readers would find it hard to put down.  As it is, I think a smaller readership will be the case...sad, because it has such interesting ""bones.""

It’s almost as if you are able to sit with each author and dig into their brains to find out what makes each one special; what makes each one stand out.Each author clearly put all the emotion and thoughtfulness into them that anyone could ever want.This is the kind of book that I keep…and re-read from time to time so that I can enjoy it all over again.

617,"Lee Smolin is a great mind and a wonderful author.  This latest book let's us in on what he's been doing and thinking recently, but it starts out with a re-hash of quantum history which is done much better elsewhere.  Elsewhere?  The bibliography mentions quite a few histories but seems truncated with authors alphabetically after Kuhn are missing (except for a Smith).  This truncation appears obvious due to Manjit Kumar's classic quantum history book being missing and all entries are beginning with the first 11 letters of the alphabet (except the one mentioned above.  I think this must be an unintended text deletion publishing error.Footnotes and references are done well but have some distracting misses: p. 247 ""In a recent paper I..."" what paper? p.256 ""...I follow some pioneers..."" who?These are minor details compared to the great insights Lee Smolin provides on his thoughts, approaches and direction toward working on the nagging aspect of the foundation of quantum theory that needs a completion that we can all grasp.The book contains a great first person account of where we are right now in year 2019.",5,0,1121,0.115,1

The mother, who was hypercritical and probably somewhat emotionally detached, had a history of unresolved sexual abuse trauma as a child.  One or more of the kids were sexually abused by a priest.  One or more of the kids sexually abused their siblings.  There was horrible violence between the siblings.  The father, who was physically and probably emotionally unavailable to his kids in their formative years, was a serial adulterer and workaholic.All of this and yet, you could see they were still a very likeable and surprisingly relatable family, at least in the early days before the illness had taken captive 6 of the sons.Lindsay is a bright light in the story.  She tackles the trauma head-on and comes out standing strong on the other side of her childhood misery.

Zach is the son of the prosecuting attorney and is exciled from his school, friends, and girlfriend because of his mothers choice.  This is a gripping novel and well written.  It is very young adult in it's format.  The topic of blaming ones self and PTSD are covered but are done so in a lighter way, not in a soul wrenching type of fashion.  I think the characters were fairly well written, although we don't learn a lot about them outside of what relates to the shootings.  This book does involve young love and forgiveness and friendship.  I think this would be a great novel to get teenagers talking about the epidemic of school shootings and for opening up discussion around the long term effects.  This book was emotional, but wasn't nearly as difficult to get through as I thought it might be.  Overall, it was definitely worth the read and I love that the author put  the spotlight on the survivor and ongoing trauma that is often overlooked.",4,0,1119,0.236,1

624,"""Liberation"" is yet another novel focusing on the French Resistance movement and an extraordinary woman who was a leader of that movement.  Based on a real individual, the novel is at points exciting and intriguing.  Imogene Kealey takes readers into the depths of the movement and the lives of individuals who were essential to its existence.  The heroism of Henri Fiocca and, more importantly, of his wife Nancy Wake who survived him and was known to the Nazis as ""The White Mouse"" is extraordinary.The novel is well written, but in one aspect disturbed my sensibilities and resulted in the three star rating rather than four.  Kealey chose to use the ""f word"" liberally and to continually and unnecessarily describe events or time periods as ""sh ***y"".  While the use of such terms may be warranted in during heated battles and in wartime situations, the overuse detracts from the novel and its potential.  I recommend ""The Nightingale"" by Kristen Hannah or ""The Women in the Castle"" by Jessica Shattuck as better written and more engaging novels focusing on World War II and the Resistance.",3,0,1094,0.139,1

It's a point that is hammered home needlessly, as if the author is  worried the reader won't get it.  However, the reason the protagonist is so off-putting is nothing to do with his vices....it's due to the fact that he's just a really, really crappy detective.  He doesn't share information, communicate with anyone, or dot his i's/cross his t's, and it takes him forever to put two and two together.The book is at least 50 pages too long, maybe more, because it's filled with needless padding:  a laughable sex scene, endless depictions of the detective ordering drinks and smoking cigars, and boring details of distant side characters that make not one bit of difference to the plot, etc.  I actually skimmed through some of the worst of it....because wake me up when there's some real action!If you like vigilante justice, then you'd be better off reading Dean Koontz's excellent Nameless series, which are streamlined, pared down of unnecessary dialogue and description, and tell a compact story in a neat and tidy way.",2,0,1148,0.083,1
626,"For your Stay At Home/quarantine reading, I highly recommend “The Crash of Flight 3804” , a book that documents the wars over gas and oil in the Middle East-- through the vehicle of pipelines that carry these energy resources.Journalist and lawyer Charlotte Dennett, pieces together the “immediate” past twenty years of U.S. attempted regime change in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, Libya and Iran with her father’s involvement in oil pipelines in the Middle East as a US government agent in the 1940s after World War II.  Sixty years after his death in a mysterious plane crash in Ethiopia, he was acknowledged by the CIA and his name was officially placed on the wall of stars for CIA personnel killed in the line of duty.Dennett documents U.S. government support for the Taliban in the 1990s that had agreed to protect the UNOCAL pipeline that would run from Central Asia through Afghanistan to India to U.S., as well as Saudi, Israeli and Qatar governments’ support for ISIS to prevent the Syrian, Russian and Iran pipeline. Her family’s involvement in the Middle East began at the turn of the 20th century when her grandmother, a young Smith college graduate, went to Istanbul to teach at the American School for Girls.  Bennett skillfully weaves the importance of the oil barron financing of the American University network that arose throughout the Middle East in the late 1890’s in Cairo, Beirut, Jerusalem to American influence for oil pipeline and railway construction.Dennett’s book has nuggets of information that make one shake one’s head of how today’s U.S. policies in the Middle East have a shadow back into the region’s history over 100 years ago to include the appointment of an oil barron to be Secretary of State during the Wilson administration.Dennett pieces together events in Washington, and the rich who control US policies, and how they play out in the Middle EastEach chapter should be an oped in major news outlets so that more people could learn about the oil and pipeline wars of the past twenty years in the Middle East are deeply related to similar wars over 100 years ago.She covers Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, Turkey, Libya, Yemen, Israel and Palestine with detailed documentation of the resources she found in archives all over the world—I think it's a great book.",5,0,2292,0.074,1

628,"This the newest Savannah Reid mystery after last years ""Bitter Brew"".  It is always a delight to visit with the members of the Moonlight Magnolia Detective Agency.  We start this story with Savannah and her husband Dirk on a stakeout of a suspected drug house.  After some activity and a few arrests that results with Savannah bringing home a little boy named Brody.  The mystery part of this book is the murder of a 90 year old former movie star in her 1920""s Art Deco mansion.  Ethan Malloy from ""Hide and Sneak"" returns in this book as the client that hires Savannah to solve the murder of Lucinda Faraday.  The mystery itself was OK, but what brings me back time and again to this series is the interaction between characters.  During this historic time, we all need a little levity and some Southern attitude and this book supplies it in spades.  This book also provides  something that was missing in Savannah's and Dirk's life that I will enjoy reading about in future books.  I can't wait until next years entry of this series.Thank you Netgalley and Kensington Books for this ARC.",5,0,1089,0.052,1
629,"I have always loved reading historical fiction, especially stories set in the first half of the 1900's and during the World Wars and this latest book by J'nell Ciesielski is set during this time and the blurb was so intriguing.  ""The Socialite"" is set in Paris in the early 1940's, when France is under Nazi control.  Kat feels like she is always getting her sister out of a scrape; however when she shows up to ""rescue"" her, Ellie seems happy and does not want to give up her new life.  When Kat and Barrett meet, right away you can tell there will be way more to their story and the secrets and their missions intertwine as well as their hearts.I loved the setting of this story and the historical details throughout this as it really brings the time period to life.  I can not even imagine setting off to France under Nazi control on the mission that Kat set off on and I admired her character, her loyalty and her strength.  The adventure, suspense, secrecy and love all come together and result in a great read that I did not want to put down once I started to read.",4,0,1071,0.166,0
630,"I thoroughly enjoyed reading ""The Other Family"" by Loretta Nyhan.  The story deals with many issues that Ally, the main character, is experiencing.  Her adoption & the decision to look for her birth family, separation and pending divorce from her husband and her pre-teen daughter, Kylie's auto-immune disorder.  Kylie's health issues drive most of the story, causing Ally to finally want to look into her birth family for medical clues to help her daughter.  Kylie's health is also a big issue between Ally and her soon-to-be-ex husband, sometimes bringing them together and sometimes driving them apart.Ally's decision to run for the school board to represent kids with allergies & health issues introduces some additional characters in the form of the other parents on the board or running for it.  To me, these characters were very entertaining and reminded me a little of the characters from ""Big Little Lies"", just without the murders and secrets.I also love that the story is set in suburban Chicago, where the author hails from.  The local references added personal charm to the story for me.  A very enjoyable read!!",5,0,1125,0.126,0

This book was exactly what I knew it would be, inspirational, informational, confirmed my own innate knowledge, and gave me new insight into the world around us.  I absolutely loved this book!  From page 1, until the end, I couldn't put it down, because it was such a fascinating work.  I read slowly, intentionally, so as not to miss a single thing Kim had to say.  I mean it when I say, this is one of the best books I've read in years.  I am very selective about what I read, because I'm busy writing as an author myself, so I want to feel like any book I read, was worth my time, and taught me things that will stay with me the rest of my life - I want them to become a part of me...  and this book was one of those books.  Congratulations to Kim Russo for bringing this book into the world, and sharing it with all of us.  I cannot say enough good things about this book...  I LOVE IT!

632,"I thought Christopher's first book, Not the Girl You Marry, was fantastic so I was excited to get an eARC from Edelweiss for her second book.NTGoG has two great characters, Bridget Nolan, who has wasted 12 years of her life with a guy who doesn't appreciate her or treat her well, but who she thinks she's supposed to be with and Matt Kido who is looking for a way out of his wealthy family's path for him and falls head over heels for Bridget.They meet while Matt is Bridget's intern and she has sworn off men and dating for good.  HA!  We know how that goes.  I appreciate that Bridget's breakup happens in the first chapter and is long over when she meets Matt although of course there are lingering effects.  I also appreciated that nothing happens between Bridget and Matt while she is supervising his internship because that would be terribly inappropriate and both of them realize that.  They are definitely thinking it though!Once the internship ends they are thrown together and the sparks really start to fly.  We get both fake dating and marriage of convenience here and the way Christopher sets it up make sense.  Just as the marriage starts to feel a little too real, old doubts and family complications emerge in an organic way that feels realistic and emotional.This is a witty read with a strong emotional core to the characterizations and their actions.  I loved Bridget and Matt and their scenes together were tremendous fun.I just had a few quibbles which knocked this down to a 4.5 from a 5.  I don't think it was necessary to for characters to be speculating about Father Patrick who seems a little too modern in his attitudes for a Catholic priest. Sexualizing him just seemed to be a way to squeeze in a reference to Sierra Simone's popular book series.  It felt really clunky and not kind to his vocation.Christopher also does a little too much telling about the character's feelings and reactions in a way that was awkward at times.  I didn't want first person narration but the way the dialogue is written sets the reader at something of a distance.  This is only Christopher's second book, so I expect she'll only get better at it.Overall, a great read and Matt is just a darling.  Recommend!Thanks again to Edelweiss for the review copy.",4,0,2265,0.14,1
633,"Since the first chapter, I have enjoyed every single one of young Heidi's adventures described on this treasured book.  Since the day I started reading it, I could not put it down, definitely a lovely book to read outside in the fresh air, so you can enjoy what makes it so beautiful, the feeling of freshness and beauty that it awakes in you.Little Heidi is a five-year-old girl who is sent to live with her grandfather, Uncle Alp, high, high in the European Alps after having been poorly taken care of by the careless Detie, sister to one of the girl's parents.  Uncle Alp at first seems to not want the girl's company and eagerly awaits the day in which she'll be sent away again,  but those feelings vanish for completely when he and Heidi begin spending more and more time together.  Heidi has managed to quickly make new friends, beginning from Peter, the naughty young shepherd and his family, Bridget, his mother and Grannie, his old, blind grandmother.  Each of them spend wonderful days in the mountains with Heidi's pleasant company.  However, things in that part of the alps look dark the day Detie does return to take Heidi away to a family far away in a town named Frankfurt.  Heidi is taken to the family of a lonely 12-year-old girl named Clara Sasemann, an invalid who longs for company as her own life is boring and unexciting.  Heidi longs to go back to the alps and is promised to be able to go back, but staying there for a few weeks, Heidi befriends the kind girl Clara as long as some of the house servants and serves as a good challenge for the strict Miss Rottenmeier.  Heidi's return to the mountains brings happiness to everyone but more happiness is to come when she receives the visits of her old friends.This book, written by Johanna Spyri is a true masterpiece and can be enjoyed by both children and adults alike.  It offers lots of fun-filled episodes as well as very lovable characters.  What I found more thrilling was Mrs. Spyri's simple writing style which really helped me understand the story without feeling lost or with the need to re-read.  The story is told beautifully and it lets you feel the viewpoints of each of the characters.  I would recommend this book to anyone, young and old.",5,0,2230,0.22,1
634,"'We Should Improve Society Somewhat: A Collection of Comics by Matt Bors' with comics by Matt Bors and an introduction by Tom Tomorrow is a collection of political cartoons capturing a recent moment in political time.The problem with political cartoons, and books about recent events, is that they capture a moment.  During that moment, they are fresh, but they sometimes don't age well.  Matt Bors does not like Trump.  There is no end of weird material from our current president, and there is much lampooning here about him and his followers.Some of the comics are funny, but in a large batch like this, they feel repetive, and like a joke that has outworn its welcome.  Perhaps in a weekly format, during the time of the events, they were funnier, but not so much here.  It also could be that I've never really been much of a fan of political humor in most forms.  Your mileage may completely vary.I received a review copy of this graphic novel from Clover Press, Diamond Book Distributors, and NetGalley in exchange for an honest review.

635,"I wouldn't call this a traditional romance, though there are some romantic moments in the book, but it was an interesting read with a nice and developed plot.Author, Brenda Novak, created three easy to like characters here.  Serenity Alston uses one of the new ancestry tests to find out a bit more about her ancestry, and what she finds is surprising to say the least-two half sisters.  The three women connect online-another way Novak weaves technology into the plotline in a very plausible way-and decide to meet up at Serenity's family cabin.  Each woman brings her own baggage to the meeting-work, relationship issues, and more-and that creates plenty of drama and strife for the women to work through and the reader to dig into.What could have been a standard story turns into something more, and I will say I was surprised-the twist opened new avenues to explore as well.  I do think the ending was a bit rushed, but there was closure as opposed to some novels that seem to just leave things so open ended.  All in all, this was a great read for the Christmas break-I recommend it.",4,0,1088,0.184,1
636,"Human Kind is one of those rare works that will leave you feeling better than you did when you picked it up, but also gives a roadmap to actually DO something about it.  This book is Brad's deeply personal call to action---to deliver acts of kindness to our world!  This may be more timely and necessary than ever before in our lifetimes.Brad's masterful retelling of uplifting anecdotes interwoven with the firsthand account of his family's struggle will leave you appreciating the little things in life.  For me, the story of ""Larry""---who rose from poverty to found the Society of Secret Santas and spread joy across the country---was particularly moving.  It demonstrated that a small but sincere gesture to a stranger can move mountains.  Given the present state of the world, and how rare good news and kind gestures can seem to be these days, this kind of gratitude that feels more important than ever.Brad's style is easygoing but profoundly impactful.  His storytelling will leave a smile on your face; the tools he packs into Human Kind will leave you with the ability to share that feeling.  I highly recommend it!",5,0,1125,0.268,0

638,"A Bad Day for Sunshine by Darynda Jones is the 1st book in her new Sunshine Vicram series.  I was excited to see what Darynda had in store for us in this new series, and I am happy to say I loved A Bad Day for Sunshine.Sunshine (Sunny) Vicram, our heroine, returns to her home town of Del Sol, New Mexico, as the newly elected sheriff, which she suspects her parents meddled into getting her elected.  Sunny left town years before, at the age of 17; after she suffered a trauma, having been kidnapped and then pregnant, and now comes home as a seasoned successful career as a detective, with her 14 year old daughter, Auri.  Sunny is a tough, independent, smart, funny heroine, which you couldn’t help but love.  The relationship between Sunshine and Auri was wonderful, and I loved how close they were and their cute bantering back and forth throughout the book with each other, as we got to see the POV’s between them both.The story begins with Sunshine’s first day on the job as Sheriff, with her expecting the basic misdemeanors of a small town; but immediately there is a kidnapping case of a 14 year old schoolgirl, who had also befriended her daughter.  Sunny’s best friend, Deputy Quincy Cooper, is thrilled to have his friend back, and together they work with Zee, another new member (sniper) of the police team to find the missing girl.  They made a great team, and I enjoyed their camaraderie.  I must say, I absolutely loved Levi, whom Sunny always had a crush on, but he comes from a violent dangerous family, that does include Hailey (who have become secret friends, but must keep their friendship private). Levi was not only a hunk, but he was also a great tracker, and ends up helping Sunny and her team.  You can tell he cares about her, as well as Auri, but tries to be distant, in order for them to be safe.Auri also wants to help her mom find Sybil (the missing girl) and uses the internet, as well as school papers to find information; she shows her smarts, as she is her mother’s daughter as a budding detective.  School at first is difficult, with some mean girls at school treating her badly, especially since her mom is the sheriff.  Auri finds help and friendship from a boy, Cruz, who is considered the most popular boy in school, and their friendship helps her handle the brutal treatment from the girls.What follows is an exciting adventure to find the missing girl, which will bring in some surprises along the way.  There is also a mystery about Sunny’s kidnapping, as she remembers very little of what happened, and is still determined to find out who the culprit was. I also loved how Levi was like a father figure Auri, having helped her when she was a child.A Bad Day for Sunshine was not only an intense mystery, but was a lot of fun, as Sunny, Auri, Quincy, Zee, Cruz, and others were so great together, making us laugh quite a bit.  Darynda Jones once again gives us another fantastic heroine, with a wonderful daughter and great secondary characters.  I expect in future books we will see more romance, hopefully between Sunny and Levi.  I look forward to the next book in this series, as spending more time with Sheriff Sunshine Vicram is a must for me.  I suggest you jump on the bandwagon now, and start with A Bad Day for Sunshine by a fantastic author, Darynda Jones.",5,0,3311,0.302,1
639,"Whether you're a life-long follower of Christ or taking your first baby steps in faith, Surrendered is a Bible study that provides many ""A-ha!"" moments.Here's just one of my takeaways on how to combat controlling behaviors: Am I willing to let this person discover his/her own need for God?  Barb goes on to apply Jeremiah 29:11 (the popular ""For I know the plans I have for you, plans to give you hope and a future..."" verse) as she recommends putting that person's name into this Scripture.  It goes like this: ""For I know the plans I have for ______________, plans to give _______________ hope and a future.""  Jeremiah 29:11 is just as true for others as it is for me.  God's got them!  What a reassuring promise!  It frees me from my need to control other people and fills me with peace.Lines of control soften between my eyes as a surrendered smile plays at the corners of my mouth.  Surrendering control to the Lord is not losing; it's winning the freedom He has always wanted us to enjoy.Bottom line: inhale the book, absorb the content, then give copies to your friends to study together.

640,"Walker Books US and NetGalley provided me with an electronic copy of This Boy.  I voluntarily chose to review this book and my opinion is freely given.This Boy is the story of Paul Walden, an average male teenager with a good sense of humor and a great relationship with his mother.  Paul unexpectedly becomes friends with Roby, though their friendship is put to the test because of a young lady that they both like.The best way that I can describe this book is that Paul spirals out of control and systematically changes his life in a big way.  Despite all of the turmoil, anxiety, stress, and emotional swings that Paul exhibits, I never really felt a personal connection with the character or his story.  This Boy was written from a teenage boy's perspective, so talk about the opposite gender and about certain body parts is to be expected, but the author wrote about it in a way that seemed to be about shock value.  The plot drives the story, with the characters seeming to be reacting to the events as they unfold instead of living them.  For these reasons, I would not recommend This Boy to other readers.",2,0,1113,0.101,1

This book is her best work I have read of Jen’s...Jen Hatmaker has grown emotionally and spiritually and it shows in her writing.  She writes with more grace...she is more vulnerable.  And that grace made this book a page turner.  She invited us in, at our pace.  This book is a keeper that i can use as a tool, in different seasons of my life.  I’m someone that wants to continue to be willing to grow...this book walks me through being accountable to myself...no matter what season I am in.  I don’t ever want to stop growing.  I want to share that same gift with the women in my life and this book is the toolbox needed for this.  I’m going to put this book on my shelf so I can periodically revisit it...check in, because sometimes we lose ourselves in all the busyness of life...and we need to remember who we are, and what our voice sounds like..and maybe it will sound different in a few years. 💜",5,0,1075,0.095,0

You might have make a special trip to buy some of the ingredients in this recipe collection.Also, you will need to do more ""babysitting"" with the food as seafood can be fickle and the difference between underdone and overdone can be a matter of moments.

It's shallow, repetitive, and totally lacking in the kind of spiritual nourishment her first book offers.  I don't know if this is because JF is trying to launch herself from Catholic fame to mainstream fame, but I think the book does reflect an unappealing self-involvement on the part of the author.  I mean, the first few pages alone where she describes how she went from being a boring, minivan-driving, loser housewife to the blown-out, Instagram-addicted radio host she was (until recently) made me have to literally put the book down for a while.

653,"Reading HumanKind in the stressful, upside down times of Covid felt like a breath of fresh air.  A reminder that there is still goodness in the world that we can still see and access if we just take a step off the path to notice.  This book left me with a strong desire to be more mindful of all the simple glories around me each day.  It also left me with the message that few of us will solve a major crisis in the world but that each of us has the power within us to make the small corner of the world we inhabit a kinder place.Brad is a remarkable storyteller who leaves you feeling a part of each tale he spins.  His writing is crisp and clear without extraneous clutter.  His style provides an excellent framework for each story to allow itself to be told.  I am proud of that he has decided to donate all the proceeds of the book to Big Brother/Big Sister of America.  Thus, his book comes full circle and closes the loop with a final act of kindness and generosity for kids in need.  A small HumanKindness we can all be part of.Bill Gallagher, PresidentSpark the Wave",5,0,1075,0.208,0
654,"What I love about Michael's newest book is how actionable it is.  It makes sense that the Business also has a Hierarchy of Needs.  Michael not only presents what the hierarchy is, but how to easily find (less than 15 minutes for me) the Most Vital Need - what to work on next.That in itself is great, but looking over all the places that need to be fixed, I can assign less than most vital to the Team, and have them start working on a fix while I focused solely on the most vital.  by the time the delegated works becomes the most vital (if ever), the Team has things in place to execute and address quickly.FYI: I read the book on Monday.  It is now Thursday and the process to address the Most Vital Need is already in place (making it less than most vital), and this evening, I will go back thru the hierarchy, looking for the next Most Vital Need.  At this rate (1 1/2 per week), in a year, we will knock out 78 Most Vital Needs in the Business plus what the Team is going to bring home over the same time period.Michael, please keep thinking, writing, podcasting, and talking!Steve",5,0,1087,0.171,0
655,"""Sea Change"" is something a little different, yet much the same and familiar, from Nancy Kress.  The new novella, in addition to being smart science fiction is also something of a thriller.  It also heavily relates to our times and our society, and gives the reader a scary look into what could be in store for not only our nation but the world in the very near future.The subject is GMO crops.  Carol Denton is an agent in the Org, a group of clandestine scientists organized into cells - you know the drill: cells are small, and no one knows where any other cell is, and who are the members of those cells, so that if one  member is caught the entire organization doesn't fall - that is trying to convince the world that GMO crops are not only okay, but are necessary and essential if the world's population is to be sufficiently fed.The issue is something called the Catastrophe, an event brought on by a genetically engineered drug caused the deaths of hundreds of children, which caused an economic collapse and all the rest of the things you might expect.  The end result was that GMO crops were banned, and that trying to produce genetically engineered food was considered a crime.  Carol has a personal interest in the situation in that Renata Black - Carol's real name - had her son die in the Catastrophe.The story starts with Carol encounters a self-driving house (heck, we're still only working on self-driving cars) that is out of control and causing traffic problems.  Carol recognizes a particular colored marker on the house that indicates that it belongs to the Org.  She goes in to take a look, finds something unusual (come on, it's not every day your normal self driving house is out and about causing issues), and the story begins.  From there we move on to political intrigue, romance, deception, and  betrayal.But the story is not just all about that stuff.  In typical Nancy Kress style, we learn about GMOs because of her expertise in biological sciences.  The infodumps, such as they are, really aren't. They're snuck into the narrative in such a way that the reader may not realize they are being educated about a subject that is import now, not just in the time of the story. Kress also weaves family concerns into the story as she normally does (see her recent Yesterday's Kin novels).  So even though the trappings are not of a typical Nancy Kress story, it really is a typical Nancy Kress story.  As usual, it's also well and smartly written in a style that makes it easy for the reader to get involved without that sense of being talked down to.If I had to pick a nit about something, I would say that at novella length, the story is too short.  It seems to me that there is a whole lot more there that can be expounded upon.  The story is good.  I expect that it could be a whole lot better if it was novel length.  It would not surprise me if Kress was planning on expanding the novella into at least a novel, if not a  trilogy, much like the Yesterday's Kin trilogy.  The subject of GMO crops needs more room to breathe, and the public needs to know more about them.  ""Sea Change"" is a really good start.",4,0,3139,0.07,1
656,"Month9Books and NetGalley provided me with an electronic copy of The Best Week That Never Happened.  I voluntarily chose to review this book and my opinion is freely given.A friendship was born from a family vacation.  Will the bond that Kai and Tegan formed long distance provide a connection at a most crucial time?The Best Week That Never Happened tries to show how personal bonds can provide a connection in the most unlikely of ways, but the book was largely unsuccessful for me.  The story travels back and forth in time, providing a loss of continuity that prevents a bond between reader and the characters.  I never felt any connection to either of the main characters, though their personal stories should have evoked an emotional response.  I wanted to like this book, but I felt cheated by the overall resolution of the premise.  There is not enough of a story for a full book, so the author employs what I feel is a trick to push the plot forward.  This YA novel is not overly memorable and is not one that I would recommend to other readers.",2,0,1054,0.114,0
657,"I prefer having the author of a book do the narration especially if I've heard them on podcasts so I enjoyed Chris Guillebeau's performance.  I like the story format and found the book both inspiring and thought provoking as I realized I have the knowledge and tools already at hand to start a side hustle; there's no need to invest in anything else.  Do the work of figuring out what my skills are and then how to monetize them.  In this way the book reminds me of an update of Russell Conwell's classic ""Acres of Diamonds""; don't go looking outside for the answers when they've been inside me all along.My criticism of the book is that a pdf of The Third Way Manifesto wasn't included.  In the ""Interlude"" between chapters 6/7 he says to go moneytreebook.com for a copy but it isn't there so the listener is left to spend time tracking it down.  This criticism also holds true for any book that is heavy on facts.  Either include a pdf or clearly tell us where we can get one.Overall I highly recommend the book.

658,"This is a great motivational book for runners; it will make you want to go out and run hard for as long as you can.  That's running to the edge and staying there, the simple training method that has been extremely successful for coach Bob Larsen.  The books is in two parts.  In the first part, you learn the story of how Larsen started out coaching in a small high school and how he developed the Jamul Toads Running Club into a bunch of elite runners.  You get the story of Bob Larsen and how he developed his training plan, as well as the stories of each of the individual runners who made that club so successful.  These are all great stories.The second part of the book focuses mainly on Meb Keflezighi, but does include the story (or part of the story) of Deena Drossin, as well, the two most successful marathon runners Bob Larsen ever trained.

I have read dozens of these books over the years, that touch on summaries of multiple serial killers, monsters and etc. but this one had a lot more detail.  Yes you can search online and read about many of these people as well as watch their Netflix specials and what have you but, I am old fashioned and there is something a lot more enjoyable when actually handling a tangible book/encyclopedia.  I am not really sure of the hate from the previous reviewer.  A simple search would have shown who each chapter was about.  Even Apple let me view several sample pages so that I could get a feel for the book before going through with the actual purchase.

I was really hoping I’d like it, but the description sounded nothing like Charley Davidson – nothing!  But, I started reading.OMG, I loved it!It’s all here.

661,"In this last book of the trilogy, the Flow streams that connect all of the Interdependency worlds are collapsing.  Since all but one of the systems is not self-sufficient, this means a lingering death for billions of people unless a way is found to move them to the only Earth-like world and its universal space.  The Houses have monopolized all supplies and ships and have made the Interdependency worlds totally dependent on them, but collapse of the Flow streams makes it impossible to provide for them and to make money.

She blamed herself for the fact that 4-year-old Sebastian was gone.  The FBI exhausted all leads and even the PI that Marin hired had only more bad news for her - while investigating Sebastian's kidnapping, she discovers that Marin's husband, Derek, is having an affair with much younger McKenzie.  Marin feels such rage and needs to do whatever she can to hold on to whatever family she has.That's enough information.

She is so passionate about women being healthy and whole and living fully in who God created them to be.  She invites ALL women to the table and celebrates our differences in opinions and beliefs.  But she keeps coming back to the fact that the healthiest women are those who are living true to themselves and their beliefs and are not shrinking to fit into society's norms for them.

Perhaps it is the climate we are currently living in with lots of depression and fear but this book was a burning light of hope and redemption.  A tough trainer, a loving mother, a runaway and a kingdom in disarray are the characters and the setting.Durst shows that entrenched bureaucracy however enlightened may conspire to spread mediocrity as a means to hold power.  Reincarnation and auras are tools that promote the story.  To me, the building of self-confidence, the belief in one self and loved ones, the awareness that recognition of self-worth may be frightening to petty and venal despots are fruits of this splendid learning tree.

666,"I'm glad to see this book being reprinted as it's probably one of the better memoirs written about the German invasion of the Soviet Union.  Having read hundreds of histories about the war on the Eastern Front and dozens of memoirs from both sides, Dr. Heinrich Haape offers an original look at the German advance into the Soviet Union through the eyes of a medical doctor - one who was not above taking up a weapon and engaging the enemy in combat.  This memoir was written in the 1950s, which means the author was not far removed from the events he's describing.  Some of the exchanges and descriptions are quite detailed, so I'm sure there's some literary flair, but the majority of the text reads true enough to the events on the ground as we've come to know them.The strength of the volume is undoubtedly some of the candidate conversations the author has with his comrades and reflections on German leadership and generalship.  The battles the author participated in are also well described and really bring to life the hardships suffered by soldiers on a regular basis, especially since you're hearing about it from a doctor who has insights into the various ailments that we rarely hear about.However, readers should also approach these memoirs understanding the time they were written in as well as the context.  As with most German memoirs about actions on the Eastern Front, there is limited, if any, mention of the genocidal campaign that was being waged at the same time in the rear against the local population.  There are some hints about what was happening but the author does not explore those issues in any type of meaningful way, as if what happened in the rear had no impact on the frontlines.  Similarly, Soviet forces are too often faceless hordes.  Although Haape does discuss the various prisoners of war he took under his direction to help with both German and Soviet wounded and some of the interactions he had with the locals, the focus, understandably, is on the German war experience.  This is an understandable deficiency and one that many memoirs share, but it's important to keep in mind when understanding the value of these memoirs.",4,0,2166,0.089,1

669,"This is a novel that reads remarkably like a Hollywood ‘scientific’ thriller.  At first, this annoyed me since I hate when the gloriously complex format of a novel is brutalized into the infantilizing emotion-jerking vocabulary-of-a-first-grader wreckage of a written-out movie.But here, there’s a reason for it.  We have a classic movie set-up.  The firebrand political activist and the handsome actor meet and fall in love at Yale( why is it always Yale?)  They are together, on and off, throughout their twenties.  Then they have a fight that ends it all.  The younger brother of the hero gets them back together after the tragic too-early death of the the heroine’s parents in(what else?) a car crash.  She gets pregnant.  Despite being an ardent pro-abortion activist, she keeps the baby, even though they have no plan or mental maturity for raising a child( if that doesn’t sum up Hollywood liberalism, I don’t know what does).  Their marriage falls apart, but she doesn’t care because she’s a Mother now.  Then the little boy dies in a tragic completely bizarre accident.  The world falls apart at the same time.  The younger brother reappears, as well as the woman who called her to call her to her son’s deathbed and they give her two new purposes in life.Since this is a movie, in the name of ‘complexity’ this is all told as a series of flashbacks.There are two interesting points which suggest a touch of irony.  This is all focused on the activist woman.  If this was a movie, it would be told from the point of view of the top movie star love interest.The ethics is inverted.  The heroine is a pro-GMO activist, not an anti-GMO one and her network is made of rogue scientists who are continuing the work the agricultural corporations defunded under political pressure and crazy botnet-creating programmers.I think, however, that the novella could have been improved by using the trick from Susan DiRende’s Unpronounceable, that this was all a movie all along.So, this isn’t Kress’s best work  and may be her worst, but it’s still good enough for a fan like me.

The book stayed in publication until the 1960’s.Marsh used multiple narration to tell the story of the beetle and this helped make the story seem more interesting and more realistic.The story opens with a young man who is down on his luck, we don’t discover that his name is Robert Holt until the middle of the story, looking for shelter.He wanders into a neighborhood where he comes upon a house that looks empty, so he climbs through an open window to get out of the rain.  What he climbs into is a terror so thick and paralyzing that it leads to the path of a powerful world of fear.Marsh, of course, lives during a time when racial bigotry and class snobbery is common, so expect some views of that in this story.  However, it is a story of horrific horror and mystery that prevails you to suspend your disbelief and invite you in to enjoy yourself.",5,0,1066,0.065,0

681,"'Ed Leffingwell's Little Joe by Harold Gray' by Harold Gray is a collection of comic strips about a young cowboy from 1937-1942.Harold Gray was the creator of Little Orphan Annie.  His cousin Ed Leffingwell wrote a comic strip called Little Joe.  When Ed died, Harold Gray took up the reins of his cousin's comic strip and signed each one with his cousin's name.The comic strip is about a little cowboy who has lost his father.  His surrogate father is a grizzled cowboy named Utah.  They find and lose fortunes.  They have run-ins with outlaws and native Americans.  They even adopt a bear.  And towards the end, Little Joe finally starts to look for revenge on the person who killed his father.It's an odd, dated comic, and I really loved reading it.  The style is very much in the style of Little Orphan Annie, but I preferred these stories with their darkness and humor.  The art is really great with some wonderful clean drawings.I received a review copy of this graphic novel from IDW Publishing and NetGalley in exchange for an honest review.

682,"D.J. Palmer has written a book to entertain, but it also scared me, kept me reading much later than I should have been awake, and had me cheering for a thirteen-year old and hissing whenever Simon appeared on the scene.  The synopsis, briefly, is that Nina Garrity’s husband Glen disappeared seven months ago.  Now, she has re-located herself and her two children into a smaller home and is living with Simon Fitch, a teacher at the middle school who seems to be the answer to her needs.  Connor, her son, is as enamored with Simon as Nina because Simon plays ball with him and is teaching him to use power tools and build a robot.  Maggie, the aforementioned thirteen year old, is not fooled by Simon and is determined to show her family the dark side that only she seems to be able to see.  This book started slowly, but like a train, it quickly picked up speed and was hard to put down and a thrilling read.  Nina does not see Simon’s dark side until she returns to work and then she is really in for a surprise as she works to protect her family from the evil that is all around them.  I think my favorite character was Maggie’s new friend Ben.  When all of her regular friends desert her, Ben sees her dilemma and sits with her at lunch.  Ben is also the only character in the book willing to give Maggie the benefit of the doubt and listen to her qualms about Simon.  I liked his calming presence and his attitude of attacking a problem with logic and thoughtfulness.  All in all, this book was amazing!  There were some really surprising twists that I had me dropping my jaw in absolute awe at how well the author tricked me.  I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys thrillers that will chill you through and through.DisclaimerDisclosure of Material Connection:  I received a complimentary copy of this book from the publisher via Netgalley and also a hard copy from St. Martin’s Press.

683,"I have read most of Quinn's novels and especially enjoyed the Windham series; but this one NEVER got off the ground.  The story arc was weak - Girl is compromised by a fool; young medical student who is a neighbor and friend is prevailed upon to save her reputation; both really do love each other.  Add some cats - who were annoying at best - and some situations where Georgie acts like a modern woman: helping her husband in medical procedures and even handling leasing a house with a land agent (How edgy can one 18th Century woman get?)  Nicholas is a pleasant and nice young man throughout.  Georgie is not the social rebel we are to think that she is.  The conflict just was not there, nor was there much action.  Those two butlers were a very lame attempt at wit and humor.  The hours reading are those I will never get back in my life.  If this is meant to be a lead-in to the upcoming ""Bridgerton"" series on Netflix, I doubt if it is going to have anyone eager to view that series at all.

She provides a very detailed and interesting history and explains well how that history lead to the political environment today, for her a very depressing environment.  I believe she is sincere in her belief about where our country is now and where it is going, but she doesn't prove a lot of what she says.  Kendzior provides many facts that are well known and easily verifiable, but she includes a lot of accusations and suppositions mixed in that are not verifiable, and she makes no effort to prove them.  I believe Kendzior is a brilliant writer and this book is extremely well written and a good read, but a journalist should provide proof of the accusations in this book and she does not do that.  On the other hand, maybe she doesn't need to.  This book was intended for readers who already believe, and they don't need proof.I'd like to believe, but I need proof.",4,3,1045,0.137,1

I was not disappointed.This is the true story of Noah's childhood and early adulthood in post-apartheid South Africa.  I've read several books about South Africa, including the Boer War and apartheid.  This book is a very personal account and is therefore very human, not formal at all.I've been to South Africa and am fascinated by the people there.  Part of the trip was a few hours in Soweto, a black township in Johannesburg, which is mentioned quite a bit in Born a Crime.  I was astounded to learn that the people in the Alexandra township think Soweto is a (relatively) rich place.  Believe me, Soweto is no American's idea of luxury.  The residents are very poor and people live largely in shacks made out of whatever materials can be found.  The people in Soweto were very gracious to our group of about 16 white Americans.I read this book over 2 days.  Fascinating and well written, it reads like Noah is talking to the reader.  I highly recommend it.",5,0,1040,0.181,0
687,"This was my first experience with a Deon Meyer novel, and I was not disappointed.  The novel moves along at a fairly steady rate (although about 3/4 of the way through it seems to lag a bit).  I almost wish the book was a bit shorter and got you to the pay off sooner.The novel follows two distinct story lines which come together at the end.  My other complaint with the book was that I was really anticipating the pay off at the end, and while the stories do converge they don't converge in a really radical, or unexpected way.  The story does pay off, but the pay off was less than I expected it to be.  There is also at least for me a little confusion about the end, and knowing which side I should be on.  I don't want to say more than that so as not to provide spoilers.Overall the book is very well written, and the story lines are interesting for sure.  They kept me engaged throughout the book.  My complaints are mostly for smaller issues in the book, but I still found it enjoyable to read.",4,0,1001,0.127,0
688,"One of the best known names in writings in the westerns by William Johnstone is Jensen.  In this case it is Matt who is the star of the book,Die with the Outlaws; he is a drifter who travels to various places where there is a need for someone to act and ends up helping folks live better lives, . The storyline of the book is not exactly the norm,  although there are parts that are found in almost every western novel.  There are certainly good guys and bad ones.  But here we have a person of color being introduced into the western story.  This was not at all unheard of to find a black man in the west but is a bit unusual in books of this genre and time.  This man is named Isaac and to add some intrigue, he was trained as a lawyer but basically prejudice prevents him from practicing.  He will play a pivotal role in setting things right.The good guys in this story are ranchers in a valley in Sweetwater, Wyoming that is being harassed by two wealthy and influential men.  Their sole purpose seems to be to take over the entire valley and drive out, through any means the rest of the ranchers and farmers in the area.  This includes murder, even though they would not deign to get their hands dirty with that business.  Through a series of calamities that causes several of the valley inhabitants to leave, the one man and his wife are faced with some difficult decisions as their horses are being rustled.  The sheriff is not a bad man but is cowed by the two powerful men to the extent that he has deputized a gang of ruffians called the Regulators to enforce the peace. These are a bunch of ne’er-do-wells led by a disgraced former policeman from Missouri.A letter to a sister leads to a good friend who contacts Matt Jensen for help.  Jensen is a really fast gunman but one who uses his skill and speed for good, unlike some gunfighters of the day.  A series of incidents that are interspersed with in the normal day to day life lead some of the people to decide to pack up and leave and some are guilty and executed by the “legally questionable” Regulators.  This type of going on does not sit well with Matt and he inserts himself into the fray.  This does not earn him any good will from the wealthy ranchers or their hired-hands, the Regulators.  A couple of gunfights establish Jensen’s supremacy and this leads to fear on the wealthy ranchers part and causes them to hire a tough gunslinger nicknamed the Undertaker.  Obviously the story revolves around the upcoming gunfight between these two.The power of the press comes into play as does former friendships.  The story builds to a climax that sees killings, erstwhile bad people converting, marriages, and in generally folks setting up to live happily ever after.  In this regard the book follows the traditional western genre – bad men, good men, conflict, setbacks for the good guys, evil is overcome, and good triumphs.  But even in triumph, there is loss and pain.The book is a good read and a quick one.  The character development shows complexity and strength and weakness all rolled together in the storyline.  An enjoyable way to spend a couple of lazy afternoons on the sofa reading and enjoying what is developing.",5,0,3195,0.158,0
689,"This is the first of Anne Perry's Daniel Pitt novels that I have read, the earlier two being Twenty-One Days and Triple Jeopardy.  Son of Charlotte and Thomas Pitt (protagonists of over 30 novels in their own series), Daniel is a junior barrister in London working for a reputable, old firm.  I have read almost all of the Charlotte and Thomas novels and have wondered, as the books move through the period of Queen Victoria's rule, whether Daniel and his sister Jemima would simply fade out as they became adults.But no, as England transitions to a time with a new monarch, so too does Perry transition to a series featuring Daniel Pitt in his twenties.  His father and mother have brief appearances in One Fatal Flaw, but the emphasis is on Daniel; his burgeoning professional/ romantic relationship with Miriam fford Croft, a scientist without the legal ability to be a doctor; and barrister Marcus fford Croft, Miriam's father.The crux of the story involves a series of trials in which fire and dead bodies dominate.  Science is an up-front element because an eminent forensic expert Sir Barnabas Saltram has provided crucial information in all of them.  We learn that Miriam studied with Saltram some years before, and she is able to persuade him to testify in Daniel Pitt's cases.  From that scenario spins the rest of the tale.I found two things very intriguing about this novel.  First, how many female scientists Perry could introduce into the story.  Not only Miriam fford Croft, but also Marie Curie (one brief reference) and  Dr. Evelyn Hall, a renown forensic expert practicing in Holland, who testifies for Daniel and begins the process of bringing to light the “fatal flaw”: desire for revenge.Also, the most suspenseful scenes are in court, and here Perry utilizes the same dialogue savvy that she uses in her William and Hester Monk series, which often features barrister Sir Oliver Rathbone.  Like a few good courtroom procedurals on television, the lawyer-witness parrying kept me riveted.In all, I think I'll now read other Daniel Pitt books, looking forward to more of the Daniel-Miriam relationship and courtroom dramatics.I was given an advance review copy of this book by LibraryThing.",4,0,2209,0.047,0
690,"Exploitation and vengeance are the principle themes I found in this book.  The French exploited the Indochina (Vietnam) population and its resources as it develops the rubber industry shown through the world of the Michelins.  They avenge their livelihood by breaking the backs of the laborers and squelching the uprising of communism.  The two main characters, Jessie and Marcelle, exploit and avenge their situation and against each other.  Jessie seems vulnerable but determined as her story unfolds from abuse and poverty in rural Virginia to wealth and love in Paris and eventually to Vietnam.  Marcelle appears strong and strong willed as she shuns her wealthy upbringing to supporting the uprising of communism in Vietnam.As the story takes place in the 1930's Vietnam,  I learned a lot about the French control and colonization of Indochina.  My knowledge of this history was very limited..  The author weaves both the history and the story nicely with a good pacing and character development.  I would definitely recommend this book for those who enjoy women's stories and historical fiction.",4,0,1101,0.229,0

692,"“The Last Summer of Ada Bloom” is a difficult book to read.  Author, Martine Murray, is slow and methodical in how she unfolds this story.  One chapter at a time, one character at a time, one perspective at a time.  It feels laborious most of the time.Because it takes so long for the story to develop this way, we also don’t get to know the characters well, for a long time.  It makes empathizing or understanding motivation really difficult.  That’s unfortunate because the reader is already contending with an huge variety of players: an almost 10 year old, teenager(s), mom and dad and for us Americans, we have the cultural differences as this story takes place in Australia.The story is dark, quite violent and involves children and animals in those themes.  Many readers will be put off by the writing.  All the characters are unhappy, looking for more, keeping secrets, striving, needing.  “The Last Summer of Ada Bloom” wants to be a book about the triumph of love; for me, it fell short.All things considered, well written but not for everyone 📚",3,0,1055,0.066,0
693,"THE GOOD ASSASSIN is a must read for anyone who watched and enjoyed Sasha Baron Cohen's portrayal of Eli Cohen in THE SPY.Steven Talty tells a tale that occurred contemporaneously with the events in THE SPY.  Germany debated a twenty-five year cap on any crimes committed during World War II.  The prospect of murderers complicit in the Holocaust suddenly walking free was abhorrent to many.  The Mossad discovered that Herberts Cukurs, once called the ""Lindbergh of Latvia"" and the killer of perhaps 30,000 Jews, is living in Brazil.  An unprepossessing spy is sent to befriend the ""Butcher of Latvia"" and lure him to his death.What follows is a well-told tale that proves that fact is indeed weirder than fiction.  More amateur hour than split-second operation, the mission to assassinate Cukurs has its share of missteps and strange turns.An unintended consequence of the book is Talty's ability to capture the conflicting views of Germans and many others, who saw the moratorium on convictions as a way to put an end to collective guilt.

The 4th girl was spoken about extensively.  I wish the author had given each of the girls an equal voice.  Every other chapter was about the author and her family.  Although the author has an interesting story and family, I wanted to read about the Chibok girls, not the author.  It also seemed that the author, a journalist, was obsessed with capturing photos of the girls and gaining an exclusive with them.  This made her seem exploitative.  I think this is an important story to tell, however I do not think it was told very well.  Overall, this is not a book that I will re-read or recommend.",2,0,1021,0.101,1

Her daughter Maggie, however, is distrusting and sees another side of Simon that he hides from Nina and Connor.Nina first met Simon when they worked on a project for the school  where he is a teacher.  Now he has shown up to return Daisy, their dog who had been missing.  He offers to help the family out by cooking dinner for them and soon after he and Nina start dating.  Now they have found a house together and Simon has proposed.  At one time, Nina had been a social worker and has now decided to go back to work but Simon insists that he has enough money to support them.  When she makes plans to meet up with her friends, there is always an excuse to make her cancel.  It is Maggie who notices the dark looks when things do not go his way but Nina attributes her dislike to a refusal to believe that her father is not coming back.While Simon knows everything about Nina, he is reluctant to discuss his past.  Married twice before, his first wife left him and the second committed suicide.  After consulting a therapist, Nina decides to both confront her husband’s mistress and look into Simon’s past.  What she finds is a complete surprise.  Maggie is also doing some digging and discovers that Simon has a life and home outside of their family that poses a danger to them all.From the opening pages I was drawn into this book.  Nina wants to believe in Simon and is afraid of making another mistake in her life, but Simon is too good to be true.  Pure evil hides behind that benevolent personality.

697,"It is 1960 – the Sydney Opera House is halfway through its construction and Australia has recently introduced conscription to the Vietnam war – two events that are pivotal to this novel.  Jorn Utzon, the architect of the iconic building, is facing increasing criticism and the country is divided in its opinion on conscription.Against this turbulent background, Pearl Keogh, a young journalist has been relegated to writing for the women’s pages of her newspaper after she has been spotted involved in a protest against the war.  Pearl has grown up with a social conscience and a well-developed guilt complex, following a troubled childhood.  After her mother’s death, Pearl’s father retreated into alcohol dependency and Pearl and her younger siblings are sent to a children’s home.  Pearl has become estranged from her two young brothers and, feeling guilt over her abandonment of them when they were teenagers, and determined to help them avoid being drawn into the war, she sets about hunting them down.  Axel Lindquist, a glass sculptor from Sweden, is in Sydney at the same time, working on a sculpture for the opera house.  He becomes obsessed with finding Jorn Utzon.  Axel, like Pearl, has a troubled past and his search for the reclusive architect is connected to his own lifelong search for explanation of his own father’s disappearance at the end of World War Two, an event which seems to be linked to Sweden’s neutrality. Inevitably, Pearl’s and Axel’s paths cross and they embark on a tentative relationship.Pearl and Axel are skilfully drawn and complex characters.  In many ways Pearl is like Ms Olsson’s own younger self.  “I have given her a lot of the things about myself I really don’t like, shame, guilt, the appalling errors I made …” Both characters spend a lot of time on introspection and, undoubtedly, the writer uses them to provide different perspectives on the events of the time and on art and politics. Ms Olsson’s mother was Australian and her father Swedish and both Axel and Pearl become the means to encourage the reader to reflect firstly on different attitudes to art, specifically the opera house and what it symbolises and secondly on war and the complexity of neutrality.Shell’s setting in terms of place and time, is one of the great strengths of this novel.  There is a real feel of the period with its turbulent politics and threat of war, with rebellion and change happening all around and yet paternalism still dominating.  As Axel combs the city and surrounding areas in his search for Jorn, we are also given wonderfully detailed descriptions of place.  Shell is filled with images of light and water and we are taken over and over again to view the opera house as it continues to be built.This is a complex and thought-provoking novel, full of wonderful imagery and symbolism.  It’s not the kind of novel you can read quickly.  Often, you find yourself re-reading passages, pondering their meaning.  You might be tempted to wish that there was a bit less introspection and a bit more storytelling, but, all in all, this is masterful writing and, if you were planning a trip to Sydney, and a visit to The Opera House you’d go there much better informed having read Shell.",4,0,3218,0.061,0

699,"I received an advance copy of this book and I finished it, the first time, right before it came out.  I wanted to read it a second time (it's that good) and gather my thoughts, before I posted a review.This is the third book in the James Reece series.  The first book, The Terminal List, is probably the most recommended/gifted book that I have read.  It was the best book of 2018.  The second book, True Believer, was in my top 2 for 2019.  This book, blows the other two away, and IS the best book I've read this year.  The progression of the James Reece story, the growth of his character and the writing by Jack Carr, just keeps getting better and better with each outing.  The themes of the books in order are: Revenge, Redemption and The Dark Side of Man.  This book will take you on an incredible journey from page one, up until the (no spoilers) last page.  It is a dark journey, but what a ride.  In fact, this book reads like you are watching a movie.  You can totally see each scene in your mind.  That's how good the story, and the writing, is in Savage Son.Jack Carr has created a character, in James Reece, that you would be hard pressed to not become totally invested in.  You find yourself pulling for him throughout the book.  Even when there are scenes that may make the more timid reader squirm, I found myself actually cheering out loud.  To me, there is a lot of Jack in James Reece.  Both are stand up guys, they treat their men and people with respect and though I've never met Jack, They are both Teammates that I would definitely want on my team if I was heading downrange. Jack Carr said that this is the book he has wanted to write since he was a teenager.  If you listen to him speak (which you should) he tells that he had to write the first two books to develop James Reece's character, to get to the point where he could write Savage Son.  Definitely worth the wait.  This is an outstanding novel with, not only a great character in Reece, but an incredible story that will grab you and not let go.  Don't miss this one.  Go out and grab it.  It's Time To Hunt!",5,0,2092,0.132,1

703,"I first found Jo Saxton at the IF:Gathering in 2018.  She is all about helping women thrive in leadership roles.  Her current book was “The Dream of You” which I loved.  Her new book is “Ready to Rise” which I wish was around 30 years ago.  It describes many of the common issues women experience in leadership roles.  Then offers practical, but not what you would expect, solutions.  They can be summed up by saying, you don’t have to do it on your own.  Develop a village to help, especially with children.  Take care of your body.  Take time out to develop fun friendships with other women.  Develop a networks of other women and how to navigate the issues of the limited spots for women in leadership.  If possible, get additional help with babysitters, housecleaner, and even food service.  Reach out and find a mentor and even better yet a sponsor.  I recommend this book to all women in leadership (which is most of us) and especially young women who are trying to make their way in a leadership role.",5,0,1008,0.188,1
704,"Nancy Wake was a part of the resistance in France where she served honorably in a dangerous  yet righteous cause.  She wrote of her own autobiography and that as well as several biographies are available on Amazon,  Reviews of each have their reviewers that she was quite brave and was an effective leader of men.  On YouTube there are two documentaries about her exploits.  One is narrated by her, the other by one of her biographers.  I found both riveting  and well worth watching but neither will substitute for Imogen Kealey's  book or, most likely, the film Anne Hathaway reportedly plans to make from it.For the most part and in the best parts Liberation is fiction - sometimes pure fiction, sometimes fiction wrapped around a kernel of truth.  But it is a good story and it will keep interest in Nancy Wake alive,  I took one star away only for the fictitious episode that opens this novel.  They had their Nancy doing something so stupid and so dangerous that I couldn't believe she was real.  Fortunately, they never repeated this mistake.",4,0,1049,0.172,0

When her father finds love again, will the changes it ushers in help Bea for the better?The book is written from Bea's perspective, both in the present and the past.  The back and forth in time did not bother me, though it did keep the main character at arm's length.  Bea's struggles aside, the character just does not come to life for me.  All of the elements of a good story are there, but the author misses out on an opportunity to give Bea the depth she needs to become real.

(my boy friend at the time - now husband of 60 years - was horrified that I would carry the book around campus -- until I told him I was reading it for a class called Children's Literature -- and I got an A for the class making it OK)Once a few year ago I heard it said that each year a person should reread a book that was a childhood favorite.  I have done that annually - what a delight.  Guess what -- HEIDI was the first one to read, when I heard the concept.The book is full of compassion -- kindness -- sadness -- love -- actually a child's book that is good for 'children' of all ages.

707,"The book is well-written and does what it sets out to do - explain who Sun Ra was and what he was doing.  This is no mean feat.  Sun Ra was a man of many interests and beliefs, of whom many misconceptions exist.  Even most of his fans (I've been listening to Ra's music for about 10 years now) will probably learn much and gain tremendous perspective on him from this book (I certainly did).The book's story is one of a man with artistic genius within him, who probably could have been a millionaire and musical ""star"" - who chose to do other things instead.  Here is the unusual story of what he did and why he did it.There is room for another book in the world on Ra's discography, that traces the patterns, forms, and themes of his vast catalogue of recorded music.  There is room in the world for a book that tells the stories of the members of Ra's Arkestra.

708,"Kevin Hand does a marvelous job distilling an extremely complex subject into a cohesive, accessible, well-organized story that is highly engaging.  Making the case for the existence of alien ocean worlds is an ambitious task and necessarily involves primers on most of the courses you probably took back in high school: earth science, biology, chemistry and physics.  But the author skillfully uses familiar analogies and metaphors to methodically construct an argument, revealing a great deal of insight into our own oceans while taking us on a tour across the solar system to reveal the evidence for the existence of oceans on other moons.  Perhaps the most interesting part of this book includes the chapters where the author delves deep into the very core of what defines and constitutes life and then hypothesizes on the question most of us have pondered at one point or another - what might extraterrestrial 'life' look like?  This is a timely escape to help remind us of the wonders found in our own solar system beyond earth.",5,0,1033,0.145,0

Richard goes back to the 1893 World’s Columbian Exposition to illuminate the gathering of black artists, writers and performers in a section of the Exposition which encouraged them to express themselves and tell the story of their time.He also retells the story of the CHAMPION MAGAZINE which set out to appeal to black readers with a mix of articles on theater, music and athletics.  The publication is particularly noteworthy because of the high quality of editing, layout and noteworthy contributors.This book will serve general interest readers as well as students of black history well by filling in a noteworthy gap that explains how the cultural explosion of artistic creativity in the 1930’s was preceded by the building blocks of artists, events and history that enabled it to grow and flourish.",5,0,1078,0.146,1

712,"I read the premise of this book and was intrigued, but I admit I wasn't sure what to expect based on other reviews. After reading this, I have to say that I'm surprised at how much I enjoyed this book.  As a stay at home mom for many years, I admit that at times I've felt less than-I don't work, I don't bring in the money-I wondered if I was valued.  Admittedly, that's my own insecurities as my husband and children show their appreciation often-and I think that's why I felt so for the main character in the book.  Patricia Campbell is the perfect doctor's wife-hair always just so, makeup on, clothes just right-but something's missing.  It isnt' just that her husband takes her for granted, or that her kids are, well kids-something is missing in HER.She's invited to a book club-where she and the women she comes to call her friends discuss the books they read-morbid books, disturbing books-true crimes that give them all a bit of a thrill.  Until James Harris moves in-Patty's mother in law swears she knows him-he hasn't aged a day since she saw him as a little girl.  And the pages where Miss Mary tells Patty her story were so well written.  Author Grady Hendrix does a great job of making us question whether or not Patty is seeing what she thinks she is seeing, we start to wonder if it's all in her (our) head, or is James is really something 'different.'  The book spans a few years, and we see how James weaves his way into the women's lives through their husbands.Up until the last 50 pages I wondered if this was all a figment of Patty's imagination, if this was her simply searching for something more in her life, some meaning-and then BOOM!  Hendrix drops the proverbial literary bomb on us, and things pick up.  IN the end, Patty and her friends show their strength, and it was a great ride-to see the women come together made for a more than satisfying ending.I plowed through this book in two days-I didn't want to put it down.  I laughed, I cried, my heart broke a bit-and I got a satisfying ending to a story about the strength of Southern Women.  This book was so much fun, and I can't recommend it enough!",5,0,2134,0.187,1

714,"This book is great for kids that can sound out letters and just learning some slightly more complex patterns, such as digraphs like “sh”.  There is also enough repetition for children to learn a word and repeat for retention.  Almost every word follows a phonetic rule.Note that not all level 1 step into reading books are made equally.  Beginning readers get frustrated with books filled with words that cannot be sounded out.  Frustration builds a dislike for reading so it’s difficult to get them interested enough to learn “sight words”.  This book has only 20 to 25 unique words and they follow rules - albeit not all are single letter sounds.  Children that know their letters can read this book with only a little help.  Then they just get it by the end of the first read due to repetition and introducing one or two words per page.  Several other level 1 step into reading books have over 100 unique words, virtually no repetition, and largely non phoenetic words.

716,"We purchased this book in order my daughter to read and write a book report about the virtues and Christian-values through her Catholic Home School program.  We chose this copy of the book because it was original and unabridged.  Both my daughter and I read the book and thoroughly enjoyed it.  It is so superbly well-written, with bits of anticipation and humor along the way.  Heidi is about an orphaned girl in Switzerland, whose aunt took care of her until she obtained a better job, and decided it was Heidi's grandfather's turn to keep her.  Heidi's grandfather lived up the mountain in a bit of remote area, with the town of Dorfli a trek away.  Heidi meets Peter and his mother and grandmother and spends time with Peter, taking the goats to pasture.  Heidi's aunt decided to later take her from the grandfather, who came to love her, to be come a companion to an ""invalid"" girl, Clara, in Frankfurt.  Although Heidi is younger than Clara, Clara delights in the funny and inspiring things that Heidi says and does, and they become good friends.  Heidi suffered terribly as she missed Grandfather and her life in the mountains, but came to know those in Clara's life, including her grandmother, who taught her to have hope and keep praying to God, and the kind, good-hearted doctor who took care of Clara.  Heidi's simplicity, and the way she looked at life, made her long the matched simplicity of the mountains and life with Grandfather.  No spoilers here, but good things happen in the story! The characters are very well-defined, and Heidi touches the hearts of all who meet her.  If you have seen any versions of Heidi in movie form, you are missing a lot from the book.  As much as I like Shirley Temple, the producers of the version she starred in did a disservice to original Heidi book -- it is like looking at a whole different movie.  (Disney later came out with a much closer account of the Heidi book as a movie in later years.)  Everyone who reads Heidi will enjoy it and walk away with something that touches them -- something to recall and remember as their favorite part of the book.",5,0,2107,0.157,1
717,"I have felt for years that there is a serious lack of a healthy fear of God running rampant in the body of Christ.  This book names specific spiritual issues that reveal that weakness as well as HOW that can be changed and turned around.  This book is a breath of fresh air in that regard.  More and more voices are now emerging to call the body of Christ back to intimacy, holiness of life, and purity of heart.  It will take a company of 'collective voices' like this author to speak such truth in love and remind us all that we will give an account to God someday for our lives and lifestyles lived this side of eternity.Church, we need a wake-up call and need to stop pressuring our pastors and leaders to live a holy life so that we do not have to--this is utterly ridiculous thinking on our part!

But then he slips in the fudge.  To explain why deterministic pilot theory is consistent with Born probabilities suddenly particles have uncertainty in their initial positions and momentum.  What the hay?  Now, just like in Copenhagen, instruments can't possibly give exact initial conditions so a probability distribution has to be slipped in.  With this quiet re-introduction of Born's result (right out of Copenhagen interpretation), now the pilot wave theory is given the uncertainty it desperately requires and is off to the races.  And this is the repeated theme of the various ""realist"" quantum proposals --- wave your hands about exact position, momentum, and deterministic equations, and then in a short few sentences slide in Born's rule in some form because they all need it to have a chance of agreeing with obs -- and then quickly move on.",3,2,1014,0.064,1

Unlike other books that portray uplifting anecdotes of every day people, Human Kind takes it to the next level by ending each chapter with suggestions on ways you can make a difference in someone else’s life.  They are easy and achievable.

727,"Ah, Julia Quinn - such a wonderful author and such a great beginning to the book.  But sadly, it faded.  The “villain” (Freddie) just becomes pathetically silly - Nigel from “The Duke and I“ all over.  The heroine,Georgiana, starts out well, with a justifiable anger and a fight against her own depression, and a soupçon on modern feminism.  But she morphs into a wholly new person, ready to become a doctor, almost overnight.  But at least her initial reactions and then remorse over how she handled the proposal was well done.  The hero starts well, with anger and then a realization of attraction once forced to look at Georgiana in a new light.  But overall he goes from shock to happy way too fast.  By far the best part of the book, made even better by Landor’s extraordinary animal sounds, was the depiction of the cat, first as hero (in G’s bedroom) and then as pest (in the carriage).

728,"As a friend of Dr. Burnett from our shared time in the doctoral program at Boston College, I was asked to read and review an electronic version of Studying the New Testament through Inscriptions.  I have happily read and thoroughly enjoyed the book; now, I need to convince you that the book is worth buying.Burnett notes that his target audience is graduate students in biblical studies, seminarians, and pastors.  The book aims to introduce students of the New Testament to inscriptional evidence that can place the New Testament more deeply and precisely in its first century context.  Its first chapter introduces inscriptions and their relevance to the study of the New Testament.  Then, in five case studies, Burnett uses inscriptional evidence to address five separate textual questions.  He brings evidence from inscriptions from the southern Levant and Palestine to bear on the question of what it meant to describe Jesus as kyrios; assesses the rival claims for the meaning of prolambano in 1 Cor 11:21; seeks to determine the nature of Acts 17:7’s reference to Caesar’s decrees; places prominent women connected with the church in Philippi (notably Euodia, Syntyche, and Lydia) in the context of women as cultic leaders in Philippi; and brings the evidence of 23 name calculations to bear on Revelation’s number of the beast.The book is effective in making its arguments and proves its value for two overarching reasons.  First, words have meaning in context.  When the words under consideration are the words of the New Testament, greater insight into the historical context gives the pastor or scholar greater confidence that they understand what the biblical text was trying to convey.  The second reason for the effectiveness of the book is that Burnett does his homework and enables you to do your own.  The copious footnoting demonstrates Burnett’s control of the scholarly conversations.  The appendices give the reader the tools to explore inscriptions on their own, thus enabling the reader to bring inscriptional evidence to bear on their own New Testament questions.",5,0,2088,0.097,1
729,"The 3 stars is a mixed rating.  If you don't have The Application of Chess Theory, it's a good book, and worth picking up if you're interested in Geller (or, among other things, the King's Indian or Sicilian Defenses).  One of the few players to have a lifetime plus score against Fischer, and one of the top players in the world for more than two decades.  He also had a plus score against Botvinnik, Smyslov, and Petrosian.  Had a plus score in all of his games against world champions.UPDATE: My original review was too hasty; it's not a *complete* retread.  I think you'd have to be a serious Geller freak to really want both, though.  Again, recommended if you don't have The Application of Chess Theory, or if dropping 30 or 40 bucks is no skin off your nose.

730,"'Sonic the Hedgehog: Tangle & Whisper' by Ian Flynn with art by Evan Stanley is about a series of characters I don't remember from the Sonic games I played, but that was a really long time ago.While Sonic does make a few appearances as well as other characters, this book is mostly about Tangle, the energetic lemur, and Whisper, the quiet wolf who is against any kind of contact.  Whisper is hunting down Sonic, but it turns out there is more to the story than that, and it ties in to a big past hurt that Whisper has.  Can her friend Tangle help her out, or will Tangle just jeopardize things?I was unfamiliar with these characters, but they are pretty interesting and I enjoyed the stories here.  There are a few lighter story before the main one kicks in.  The art is pretty good too.  This would be a fun read for younger video game fans.I received a review copy of this graphic novel from IDW Publishing and NetGalley in exchange for an honest review.

732,"I grew up on a Nebraska farm and I read this book with a critical eye as I had just recently read, ""This Blessed Earth"" by Ted Genoways.  I wish that Graywolf Press would have enlisted the help of a fact checker.  I won't go into all the inaccuracies, but Mockett claims to be in a minority by holding onto her share of a farm and not selling, but I'm not sure that's an accurate portrayal of the greater population of people who grew up on the farm and moved away.  She never lived on the farm, so her relationship with the land is different.  My best friend from high school and I both inherited our farms in the past decade (as did most kids in my class) and we either farm remotely or are local, it's not that big of a deal.   An interesting note that I am going to insert here since the author has repeatedly brought up the subject of the size of the farm.  According to land records in Kimball and Weld county, the Mockett farms do NOT total 7,000 acres and if they once did, they have not for quite some time.  I did some checking and to verify, the Mockett  family farms in Kimball and Weld county currently total about 3,600 acres (the author and her mother own about 2,700 of those).  But what is really interesting is that the Wolgemuths, the custom harvesters from Pennsylvania, own nearly 4,000 acres of farm ground in Kimball county!  Did they buy this land from the Mocketts?  That would make the Wolgemuths not just customer harvesters -- these are farmers who own a lot of land and I would have been interested to know more about the Wolgemuth farming operation and what they own in Texas, Oklahoma, etc. -- I bet they didn't share that with the author -- that is where the story is!  This farm family has been doing this for decades, not just one summer.  The Wolgemuths have a lot invested in the heartland states, they are not just seasonal workers.  They understand the language of the people, whether political or religious.  Not sure why this important information wasn't disclosed, but for me, knowing what I know now, that dynamic would have changed the way in which I would have read the story.  WOW!If you are getting ready to read this story, keeping these facts in mind will add some perspective. Mockett does clarify that the farm is not just hers and is not 7,000 anymore, but doesn't disclose the reasons why.  She has a 1/3 stake in it, but she is a landlord, and her dad was a landlord, too, not a farmer.  It seems like Mockett shares some of these facts so desperately to validate her place that she belongs that she comes off looking like a poser. She talks about her summer and past summers harvesting, but what about the winters?   Unless you have spent decades of Nebraska winters on the farm, you are not allowed to talk about the summers.   Mockett is a beautiful, enviable writer, but I have an ag background and I found her voice, through her observations, insulting and trivial.  She references that she attended a wedding held in a barn. With no additional explanation, one would think that the wedding was held among the farm animals and the couple is saying ""I do"" amidst the chickens clucking and cows mooing.  And maybe they did.  But most likely, not.  I mention this because this is just one example of how Mockett could have used this platform to talk about how many farm families are becoming more enterprising out of necessity and gutting out old barns and making them into event spaces and it's not that uncommon to have a side hustle.  I don't know why quonset is a proper noun.  Most farm people would refer to that the same way as kleenex.  The thing that made Genoways' book credible and Mockett's not credible was the voice.  Genoways, historically, a Nebraskan, never tried to insert himself into the people.  Mockett is grappling with too much to take on here:  she trying to tell a personal story, but she does not write herself naked and raw; she is trying to talk about food and she is trying to discuss evangelical Christians, the latter two she is simply not enough of an authority based on one summer harvest.",1,1,4078,0.093,1
733,"Even though the book says it is geared for the workplace, it really pushes you to think about how we approach uncomfortable conversations in general and makes you think about the underlying emotions that make these conversations hard regardless of setting.  This is paired with really practical guides on how to approach conversation, what to listen for, and how to thoughtfully pause, think, and respond.  I found myself wishing I had this books on different occasions in my career (as an employee, manager, and later as an organizational leader).My favorite part of of the book though is the empathy in the author's approach.  We live in a polarized world and it is easier to react and shut a conversation down than to do the hard work of talking it through.  The book teachers us to consider everyone involved and try to truly understand the moment, people, and emotions involved.  I'd love to see more of this approach in the world and our everyday interactions with each other.",5,0,982,0.099,1
734,"Grant's perspective on time and money is absolutely profound and eye-opening.  I've read a bunch of books on personal finance and they all make money into a limited resource and how you must slice your limited income in m different ways, but money isn't the limited resource; time is.  Time != money.  Your potential to earn is unlimited, but you only have so long to live, and in that lifespan, you only have so many years to live it up before being too old to do anything.  Thus making time so much more than just money.  I've read to think of money as your work salary per hour - - you just can't because it doesn't scale that way.  I thought that was mindblowing.  This book lays out how Grant succeeded in obtaining financial freedom and how you could too.  This isn't someone with a 6-figure job who just cut some costs and budgeted a bit; this is someone who realized what he needed to do while unemployed with $2 and some change in his pocket.

735,"The author does a great job of putting the reader into Lincoln's era, and reminds us of important changes occurring across the north, such as the development of a substantial railroad system.  That the southern states were so obsessed with States' Rights that they could not agree on a unified rail gage standard is very revealing.  I may get down these days about the current administration's daily attempts at undermining democracy, and it seems uniquely bad, but, it equates to what the southern state representatives in the House and Senate were doing as the dismal Buchanan presidency ran it's course.  I learned a lot I didn't know, for instance, about the City of Buffalo and the economic importance of the Erie Canal.  There are so many aspects to this incredible journey and it is such a well told tale, with so many lows & highs, and plenty of irony throughout, making this a story one can really enjoy on many levels.  I certainly hope this author writes more books about that time period in American history !",5,0,1021,0.122,0
736,"The better written of the two battling bios, although as other reviewers have noted, marred by some sloppy editing.  Much as I've always admired Neil Young's work, I have to agree with David Browne's underlying premise that his addition to the CSN mother-ship ultimately brought the ship down.  To my ears, the first album (Crosby, Stills and Nash) was near perfection; with album number two (Deja Vu) the seeds of destruction were sown.  Stills' confidence undermined by the addition of his musical brother Young; Crosby slipping deeper and deeper into his drug-induced haze; Nash unsuccessfully taking on the role of peacemaking middle child, and Young's ego being fed even as he's selfishly using the band to jump start his own solo career.  Nash's Wasted On The Way tells the tale, truly.  So many false starts, abandoned albums, unattained dreams and lost friendships.  CSNY plays out like a Greek tragedy in modern times.  Lost boys with fatal flaws who occasionally touched greatness, then immediately threw it all away.  We should be thankful for those great moments.",4,0,1075,0.182,1

There's an excellent 28 day eating plan that includes a shopping list.  Again, good format for me.The veg recipes are pretty standard and included in other books or all over the web.  What I liked was the sea food section.  Here there's an excellent recipe for a Sheet Pan Low Country Shrimp Boil.  I've tried it and promise it's good.  There's also a good recipe for oven baked Fish & Chips.

738,"When Goodbye, My Rose Garden popped up on Amazon, something told me that this title held promise.  The first volume quickly drew me in and if the forthcoming volumes are as good as the first, this will be a very strong series.  It is the saga of Hanako, a young Japanese woman who travels to 1900 England in search of the reclusive author Victor Franks.  She soon finds herself in the service of Lady Alice Douglas and the two become close thanks to their mutual love of books.  Lady Alice lives in a wonderful house with an incredible library and garden and Alice herself is kind, all to Hanako's delight.  But there are storm clouds.  Alice asks Hanako to kill her.  Alice is the subject of rumors that she romantically favors other women, not a good thing in the years just after Oscar Wilde's fall from grace.  Hanako is trying to figure out how to handle this situation.  The writing and art are both strong and the characters quickly win over a reader.

739,"In April 1945, U.S. forces invaded the Japanese island of Okinawa, meant to be the last step before the invasion of Japan itself.  A enormous Army-Navy-Marine Corps invasion force confronted the island's stubborn Japanese defenders.  When the desperate fighting ended in June 1945, the U.S. had suffered nearly 50,000 casualties.  The true extent of Japanese military and civilian casualties remains unknown.Author Saul David has provided a vivid page-turning account of the campaign.  The narrative moves nimbly in its perspective from U.S. commanders down to privates in foxholes, and from Japanese commanders hiding in caves to Kamikaze pilots in Japan and Okinawan civilians caught in the middle of the fighting.  Heroism was not monopolized by either side.  The author manages a parallel narrative on the progress of the atomic weapons that would end the war.  The text includes a useful selection of photographs and battle maps.  Very highly recommended to the general reader and the student of the conflict.",5,0,1014,0.097,1

But one's understanding advances much further than using tree rings to estimate ages of trees.  The fascinating descriptions on how these rings can give clues about forest fires, wind patterns, and climate change is very informative, though requires some attentive reading.  The first-person narration and the richer context of history and culture sustains the interest well enough to educate the reader and appreciate the systematic way in which scientists observe, collect data, hypothesize and keep learning.  Moreover, that narrative style also helps the reader have a vicarious experience of a traveling scientist - and appreciate how much science, effort, people are devoted to still understanding where we live - and an acknowledgement that we are still a tiny part of a huge ecosystem and we are barely understanding the extent of what we dont know!",4,0,1011,0.207,0

742,"Overall this was a pretty good book.  I got to visit the characters the author setup very well in the previous books.  I like his language and the book is an easy and enjoyable enough read.  The downside for me was he built up a few elements in the previous books but didn't deliver here.  The last book kind of happens in a flash, he spent too much time on background or setup and not enough on advancing the characters.  I'd go so far as to say no characters really had much of an arch by the end, and the one character that had the big development was a bit too much Deus Ex Machina.  Didn't ruin it and fair enough, Scazi just kind of ends his books sometimes but I would have liked to see some more development payoff rather than things just kind of happening.  If you read the authors comments this was his first intentional trilogy so fair enough, part of his journey and I would read a follow-on series in this setting if he wrote one but I do hope he works on his endings a bit.",3,0,987,0.145,0

Reading this has refreshed my ""spicy"" side, the one I've been desperately trying to sugar coat for the past few years.  What I learned reading this, is that God made us a particular way, and if we're always focused on how others will perceive that then we are wasting the valuable time given to us.  That even people you care about, who've been around a while, can hurt you.  Deeply.  But you can heal and it can embolden your mission if you allow it.  And surround yourself with good people who do not expect you to be different than who you are but rather celebrate how beautifully unique you are.  Your tribe is vital so make sure it's filled with truth-tellers and love-givers.  If you want to be okay with who you are, or learn how to get there, this book will guide you.

745,"A dramatic and fiercely feminist bit of historical fiction.  Sue Monk Kidd inserts a remarkable character into the life of Jesus Christ — a wife named Ana.  This is Ana’s story, however, not his.  From childhood, the secret longing of this determined and deeply intelligent girl has been to have a Voice.  Beginning with writing the stories of the matriarchs of the bible, she continues throughout her life to document the stories of forgotten and neglected women everywhere.I was completely pulled in to the story. The historical context is rich with detail and insight into both the lives of individuals and the social and political currents of the time.  Full sensory descriptions of Ana’s writing — the scrolls, inks and pens; the libraries and codices; the requisite hiding places; and the rare and tenuous gift that she had been allowed, as a woman, to learn to read and write at all.  As we go through her life, we experience the inspiration for her writings and read samples as well.  I was fascinated to learn that one such sample — Thunder: Perfect Mind —  was an actual text unearthed from the 1942 Nag Hammadi excavation and dated to the time of the story.There is plenty of drama — Ana’s father Matthias is the chief scribe and advisor to Herod Antipas; her adopted brother is Judas; and she meets and marries Jesus — but the actual story was far more political than spiritual … and I appreciated the historical depiction unencumbered by later religious trappings.  As an aside, I loved the description of life in Therapeutae — an actual community of Jewish philosophers in Alexandria.While Sue Monk Kidd’s style is often a little too emotional for me, I was completely drawn into this story of a strong woman insisting on her own voice — in some ways relegating the “greatest story ever told” to a mere influence.  This book managed to completely shift my perspective on a period of time I knew little about.",5,0,1922,0.103,1

747,"I pre-ordered this book months before publication, and was eager for it to arrive.  What a disappointment!A previous edition, with the same title and published in 2006, is far better.  The 2006 edition was a minor update of the first 1994 edition.  Either of the older editions is preferable to the latest version, which has been considerably cheapened by a different publisher.Here are some differences between the old and new editions:  o Most photos in the new edition are quite small, not much larger than a postage stamp.  The old edition had a number of full and half-page photos,  well-chosen to accompany the author's commentary.  One (of many) example is the outlawing of the spitball in the 1930s.  The older editions both have a quarter-page of Burleigh Grimes overtly licking a ball he's about to pitch; the new edition has only a postage-stamp-sized photo of his face.  o The new edition is missing many great photos of the older editions, such as where they explain that Ty Cobb had no number on his uniform because he retired a year before numbers were required, but the older editions have a large photo of Cobb at bat where you clearly see the plain back of his uniformed.  The new edition does not have this photo, not even a small one.  Many other excellent photos from the older editions are missing as well.  o The first two editions had an appendix containing the complete, official rules of baseball, which was very helpful when delving into the detailed wording of any rule.  The official rules are not in the new edition.  What you do get is piecemeal printouts of individual portions of most (but not all) rules interspersed throughout the text, along with commentary.I'm still reading the new edition and may have further comments as I get further into the book, but it was terribly disappointing to see how the new publisher chose to cheapen the new edition, and was allowed to do so by the author.

The writing was quality work, exactly what I would expect from Nancy Kress.  It was the story, the actual plot, that I felt was lacking.

There are also beautiful photographs contained throughout the book.  That being said, the content was a little incongruous to the title for me.  Some of these recipes are pretty sophisticated.

My favorite thing about this cookbook is that the author makes suggestions for many of the recipes to become vegan, vegetarian, gluten-free, etc.  Very few cookbooks make it clear how to adapt recipes.

While it doesn't advertise itself as such, it appears this is gluten free and mostly allergen free as well (although nuts do sneak into the occasional ingredient list).I can't speak for any of the meals with meat, but I did sample a number of the simpler vegetarian entrees, sides and salads and this is what I think:ARTICHOKE, LEEK & WHITE BEAN GRATIN (p. 251) - I substituted vegan yogurt, egg and cheddar cheese in this one.  It came together quickly and was hearty and delicious.  I'm sure it's even better with dairy cheese.TOMATO & SPINACH ""RICOTTA"" LASAGNA (p. 267) - I was pleased and surprised to find a cashew version of ricotta cheese here.  This involved a bit more prep time (since you have to make the ""cheese"" from scratch), but was tasty and filling.5-INGREDIENT KIMCHI COLE SLAW (p. 163) - I absolutely love Kimchi and this unusual side dish could not have been easier to pull together or more enjoyable to eat.  Of all the recipes in this book, this will definitely be the one I re-visit most frequently.  A ideal alternative to traditional summer ""picnic"" sides.CREAMY CORN & CHIVE FARRO (p. 156) - The secret to creamy, dreamy side dish is the full fat coconut milk.  Utterly scrumptious.  Perfect belly warmer for a chilly winter evening.ROASTED ROMAINE (p. 298) - I've never roasted romaine lettuce before so I was nervous to try this one but charring the greens on the grill adds a pleasant depth of flavor that complements the tangy (and vegan!) Caesar hummus dressing.CHARRED GREEN BEAN & FARRO SALAD (p. 293) - Yet another dish with Farro, an ancient grain with a chewy texture and earthy flavor.  This has a long list of ingredients and looks involved, but I absolutely love the results.  The creamy avocado dressing absolutely makes it, so don't skip it.Overall, I'd say this is a great cookbook for someone who's looking for nutritious whole food meals that are easy, unique and delicious.",4,0,2070,0.245,0

755,"The idea for Live Love Now came from an index card experiment – Rachel Macy Stafford went into middle-school classrooms and asked kids a very important question: “If you could give your parents or the world one message, what would it be?” Their answers revealed their deepest struggles and their biggest hopes.Drawing from her own experiences as a parent and educator, Rachel writes beautiful stories to illustrate the stressors kids face today but she also provides practical strategies in order to be authentic, compassionate and open-minded.Early in the book, we learn that “acceptance is where connection forms”.  Stafford then inspires us to embrace three important roles to make meaningful connections and support the young people in our lives: be a Truth-Teller, be an Encourager & be a Guide.In these challenging times of uncertainty and isolation, I truly believe that Stafford’s words are needed now more than ever before.  Live Love Now is a lifeline – a reminder that shifting our perspectives and healing our relationships (including with our own self) are “still within reach”.",5,0,1091,0.209,1
756,"It speaks to the quality of this book that I found it fascinating even though I've never been a ""clubber"" or had any interest in celebrity clubs.  Peter (nee Pierre) Gatien made a fortune from the need of humans to crowd together for security and excitement.  He likens it to our prehistoric ancestors huddling in caves for warmth and safety.  Me, I'd fight a saber-toothed tiger to get my own private cave, but we introverts are always a minority.Growing up in a working-class family in post-WWII Canada, Gatien's prospects were limited.  While the U.S. enjoyed an economic boom that created a huge, prosperous middle class, Canada's economy remained sluggish.  Boys in his hometown went to work in paper mills for tiny paychecks.  While American postal workers benefited from a strong union, Pierre's father sorted mail for a salary that barely supported his family of five sons.  Their loving mother encouraged her sons to go to college, but her middle kid was a born hustler determined to blaze his own trail.Even at twenty-one, he showed a genius for catching and riding trends, starting a store selling blue jeans to teens.  Then he took over a rough bar and turned it into a popular club, attracting break-out bands and giving small-town youngsters a chance to feel part of the Swinging Sixties.  He was a success story in Cornwall, Ontario, but he needed a bigger stage to live out his dreams.Moving to Miami, he opened ""Limelight"", which became a hugely popular disco club.  Gatien is free to admit that some of his success was being in the right place at the right time, but his intelligence, attention to detail, and willingness to take chances allowed him to take advantage of the breaks.  While he loved rock 'n roll, he realized that disco put attention on the dancers and a DJ could be hired for a fraction of the fee of popular bands.  He also learned the value of making the gay community welcome in his clubs.Miami was an eye-opener for the former altar boy whose devout mother never stopped hoping that Liberace would find the right girl. But having suffered discrimination for being a French-Canadian Catholic, Gatien had a heart for the underdog and his open-mindedness grew his businesses.  The excitement that the free-spirited gays brought to Limelight made it a stunning success.Then he moved on to Atlanta and recreated Limelight there, taking advantage of the fact that the staid old Southern  town was attracting hordes of young people and developing a vibrant gay community.  Then it was on to Limelight New York.  Then Limelight Chicago and then Limelight London.  His specialty was finding unusual buildings - an abandoned  NYC church, a former Chicago civic museum, an 1888 Welsh Chapel - and turning them into unique clubs.  All were successful, but eventually the travel got to Gatien and he decided to sell his other holdings and concentrate on New York.Keeping Limelight going, he opened Club U.S.A. and took over The Palladium and The Tunnel. Each club specialized in a different clientele, but all were successful due to Gatien's hard work and genius for spotting talent.  With over 1,000 employees and thousands of regular customers, Gatien's clubs dominated New York City nightlight as no individual has done before or since.  His clubs survived the scourge of the AIDs epidemic and went on to help introduce the new genres of Hip-Hip and rap.I know nothing about rap or hip-hop, but I was fascinated to read the story of ""The Tunnel"" and how Gatien discovered the incredible popularity of hip-hop and learned out to harness it for profit.  As with his gay clients in Miami, Gatien's success was based on his willingness to reach out to people who were accustomed to rejection.  When most clubs were refusing to allow hip-hop or rap because they attracted violent crowds,  Gatien welcomed the artists (many of whom are famous now) and worked with them to solve the problems.How they accomplished that was (for me) the most incredible part of an incredible book. Knowing that the music attracted men and realizing that a heavily male audience led to fights, the club let in women free early in the evening.  The presence of women kept down the violence, as did searching the customers and relieving them of knives, coshes, and firearms. I don't know when I've read anything more entertaining than the story of The Tunnel's mostly female security team.  No script writer could come up with anything more bizarre or funnier.Through it all, Gatien continued to be a quiet, focused businessman who seldom mingled with his customers.  His shadowy presence and the eye-patch worn because of a  childhood accident earned him a sinister nickname - The Ghost. That sinister reputation worked against him when headline-grabbing Rudy Giuliani became mayor of New York City and started looking for ""public enemies"" to defeat.The government vendetta against Gatien shows the obsession of Reagan-era agencies with attacking anything that threatened the squeaky-clean ,1950's America they were pledged to promote.  Any music club that didn't play Frank Sinatra songs was branded as a ""drug den.""  The suicide of a New Jersey teen was blamed on the corrupting influence of club life.  Old laws were resurrected to close down clubs and no ""informant"" was too screwy to be believed.  In the end, Gatien was absolved of all the racketeering and drug charges brought against him.  He ended up serving two months on charges related to the cash-nature of his clubs and then being deported to Canada.Ironically, the Canadian economy is now booming.  Gatien lives in Toronto and owns a thriving club there.  If he were starting in business today, he could have built a club empire in Toronto, Vancouver, Calgary, and a dozen other prosperous Canadian cities.  He was devastated to be banished from his beloved New York City, but must enjoy the irony that Canadian Immigration Service is now swamped with visa applications from Americans longing to move to that well-run country.Much credit goes to Gil Reavill, the Ghost's ghost-writer.  He took an incredible story and ran with it.  I read 300+ books a year and this one is exceptional.  Gatien and Reavill introduced me to a fascinating world and I'm grateful to them.",5,8,6235,0.19,1
757,"I love reading fluffy vampire books...mostly Lynsay Sands' vampires.  I don't read a lot of gory vamp books, or gory/horror books at all.  This is mostly because I primarily live alone and my mind often wanders.  That being said, I was looking forward to this book with promises of humor and horror.  I waited until my husband was home for a spell and dug in.  I didn't find it humorous or scary.  A little gore when we finally got to the end and what happened to our ""vampire"" but not really through the book.I was more annoyed with the Southern Book Club ""housewives"".  I felt like it was set in the 50s, and not the 90s.  I was a 90s housewife and if my husband talked to me the way Patricia's talked to her, I'd have left him long ago!The story was ok.  The writing was ok.  The characters were annoying, the vampire was boring.  The ending, however, the last 100 pages or so, was good.

758,"A bunch of stuff in this book was necessary to close out the trilogy.  You saw things coming, in general forms, in the middle book.  Perhaps not the specifics, but the general shape.  Those were wrapped up nicely.A bunch of stuff kind of popped up out of nowhere and slapped you hard across the face.  ""There's more going on here, STILL, sucker.""  One of those things I hated, but the story flowed to it and then away from it.  One of those things was out of left field, and it twisted and turned the eventual conclusion; another torpedoed the central conceit of the Interdependency out of nowhere, but with clear signs going back in retrospect.  Surprise, sucker.  You will not expect who's left standing and who isn't, metaphorically.As someone has mentioned on Twitter, this didn't feel like the end of the series.

759,"This book was like a cheesy Lifetime movie,  one where you're yelling at the screen because of how stupid the characters are.I have said this in prior reviews,  and I'll say it in this one: you can't have a book that relies on technology to forward the overall plot while simultaneously ignoring technology to forward other plot points.  Maggie has to be smarter than this from the beginning.  Take some videos,  you idiot.  Nina has to know about this thing called a background check.  And without spoiling the ""big reveal"", I can't say what I really want to say about a very easy fix to this whole thing.The writing was very basic,  very young adult.  I think I just read a young adult book,  did I?Nothing about this gripped me.Unfortunately,  compared to other books in this genre,  it is a 2 star read that I kept putting down because I didn't really care what happened.  This plot has been done before,  and I don't like being frustrated by idiot, gullible characters who can't connect things.Thank you to Netgalley for the ARC.",2,0,1034,0.083,1

Once I started reading it on my Kindle, I couldn’t stop.  The relationships and revelations kept me hooked.  I was only sad that everything had to end, I wanted more to the story and to continue on with these ladies.  It was like a written soap opera to me.

761,"I originally ordered Island Affair (Keys to Love) to take with me on vacation.  The title suggests 'light beach read' and when I'm between weightier books of deeper thinking, this is exactly what I want.  The vacation disappeared as we are now needing to 'stay in place' and a light read is more important than ever.  Author Priscilla Oliveras' book fills that need.As a born and reared Floridian, I'm well acquainted with Key West's beauty and many of the places of interest for tourists.  If you are familiar with them too, it will make your reading pleasure all the more enjoyable.Oliveras' premise of how two strangers meet and arrange to pose as a couple (being purposely vague here for no spoiler alert) is unique.  With the sensual backdrop of Key West and sparks of sexual attraction, this is definitely pleasure reading.While entertaining, the book has a couple of negatives.  I understand that the author is attempting to draw a 'Latin' following to her series and the book is heavily peppered with Spanish (which she admirably either translates or gives contextual clues).  However, there's just too much of it.  It's grossly overdone to the point that it distracts and detracts from the story.  (I speak conversational Spanish and can understand without her translations, so that's not the issue.)  In future books of this series, I hope she and her editor will understand that the phrase, 'less is more' applies here.The second fault is the repetitive explanations of our protagonist's eating disorder.  There's a fine line between helping the reader to understand a character's motives with backstory and the overuse of it.  Oliveras needs to give her reader more credit, placing far fewer explanations throughout the chapters. Sara (protagonist) talks herself through the plot by repeating to herself what her therapist would tell her.  This step-by-step self-help borders on overkill, but the author uses it to explain Sara's motives.  That makes it slightly less annoying than the issues mentioned previously.If Oliveras fine tunes her writing with the next in her series, I'll look forward to future stories.",4,0,2126,0.086,1
762,"I have done quite a bit of reading on the subject of surveillance, and to me the largest problem areas seem to be in the commercial and self-surveillance areas.  However, this cartoon book, sees government surveillance as the only issue worth writing about.Its history is from a purely left leaning ideological viewpoint, with those opposed to the norms of the society, at the time, being lionized.  This is more a work of propaganda than a serious look at the world of surveillance in which we live.Obviously when discussing governmental surveillance the welfare of the population must be weighed against the rights of privacy of that same population.  However, rather than taking a balanced approach and letting the readers come down on where they stand, this book tells the readers where they should stand with comments such as ""Today, the balance between the needs of national security and individual privacy is greatly weighted in the wrong direction.""To me the book was just heavy handed propaganda.",2,1,1005,0.026,1

764,"Wow!  A must-read for any Victorian horror fan.This novel does have that particular British xenophobic ""Oriental mysticism"" thing going on that Wilkie Collins and Rudyard Kipling are also guilty of.  It's a bit fainter than in the works of those other two authors and pretty level-headed for having been written 3 or 4 decades into the English occupation of India.There are some pretty shocking and disturbing details that surface toward the end of the book, more like what you might expect from a 70's pulp novel.  I haven't looked up the history of The Beetle's publication, but it seems really surprising that it made it to print at all.  Or maybe people were openly discussing sex way before I thought they were.The style of the horror in this book is totally different from anything I can think of from the 1800's.  It has some Kafka-like ""speculative"" horror about it (I don't just mean because of the man-beetle) and then will abruptly snap back to polite, sane Victorian society in the next chapter.",4,0,1007,0.081,1

When the history of the Trump era is written, by another people, in another time (I suspect many decades from now), the name of Sarah Kendzior will likely figure prominently as someone who bravely tried to sound the alarm.  Sarah has tried to warn the American people (along with other brave writers) about what has happened to us and how the hell we ended up here.

I don't know what I was thinking because this beautifully crafted story over achieved any expectation I had for it!Millicent (Missy) Carmichael is 79 years old.  She lives by herself in a large, stately home in Stoke Newington, a village-like residential area of London.  She's very much missing her husband Leo, whose mysterious illness is touched upon throughout the book.  She carries the air of a heartbroken widow.  There was always tension with her oldest child, daughter Melanie, who lives in Cambridge.  Her favorite child Alistair broke her heart when he moved to Australia upon his marriage.  As a result, Missy only gets to see her grandson Arthur for a two week Christmas visit.  Their main mode of communication throughout the year is via her laptop.  As the book begins, Missy is contemplating her loneliness and taking a walk to the nearby park.  She's pushing herself to endure the overzealous dog walkers, parents and children who make the park come alive.  Her mission is to have an experience worthy enough to make it look like her life is interesting when she emails her son Alistair.  She had heard there would be a fish-stunning today.  Now, I never heard about this before and it really caught my attention.  Apparently, a park worker employs a device into the pond water which shocks the fish and makes it more manageable to transfer them to another body of water.Missy is the kind of person who keeps to herself, under the radar.  However, on this momentous morning she makes contact with some real characters.  One lady is a redhead named Angela who is a journalist and a single parent to Otis (who is around the same age as Missy's grandson Arthur).  She's rather loud, opinionated and pushy, but extremely kind hearted.  The other lady Sylvie has two small dogs in tow and a penchant for baking, and she's cheerily passing out homemade croissants.  Missy accepts one- not because she's hungry, but just grateful to be noticed.  After a momentary fainting spell, these new companions fuss over Missy and she's invited out to a coffee shop.  Missy's still a bit antisocial and begs off with an excuse to go home.  However, days later a chance meeting at the chemist with Sylvie sparks another invitation for coffee at the cafe across the street, and Missy is taking baby steps towards newfound friendships.This is one of those stories about an old, sad and lonely person who by luck or chance meets some very caring people.  In embracing these new friendships, she is like a flower slowly blooming, opening up to new, wonderful experiences that vastly improve her life.  She's kicking and screaming in resistance at times along the way.  This book was a marvel.  I laughed, cried, and gasped in surprise.

During this time, in the Italian communities, there are a number of kidnappings of women and children.  The women are often raped or abused during the time they are held.  When one of the female volunteers is kidnapped, Gino’s sister-in-law asks Frank and Gino for help.  Gino gets in trouble when he goes out on his own to “talk with” Esposito, which highlights his naiveté and his idea that his fellow Italians will do the right thing.The historical setting of late 1800s New York City is educational as well as entertaining.  I didn’t realize that there was an Italian section of Harlem, where Pleasant Avenue is located.  The philanthropy of the time is changing as settlement house.  The Harlem Settlement Hall offers classes in English, cooking, resident rooms, and other services to help immigrants gain skills and assistance to move forward.What I enjoy about this series is the dynamic among the main characters as well as the interactions with lesser characters.  Frank immediately contacts Sarah in a situation that he feels she is most qualified.  Before they married, Frank always resisted.  The dynamic between Gino and Maeve is evolving.  They always snap at one another, but now they are showing a deeper connection.  I have a connection of Frank and Sarah’s family, now we are meeting Gino’s family.  It is fun to see their dynamics.  The teasing among the brothers, and the way they welcome their oldest brother’s wife.I came to this series late and binged most of the early stories.

I enjoyed this text because it is much more concise and lays out a clear entry point into purely data-driven investing.The book begins by outlining a powerful and intuitive technique which can be used to de-noise correlation matrices.  Marcos provides strong validation for this methodology with stylized Monte Carlo.Using MC in this way is an innovative idea  -- one which the physics community has embraced for decades.  In particle physics we rely on Monte Carlo to remove reliance on empirically collected data and to validate our understanding.

780,"Another amazing job by Heather Blake!  This series, is by far, one of my top ten..  Heather magically weaves all of the things I enjoy reaching, into one book.  How is that possible?  Mystery, supernatural, family, cozy, and a wonderful ending to each tale.In “To Catch a Witch”, all of the above are scattered throughout the story.  Darcy finds herself in the midst of a murder, a sister who is under the weather and does not want to talk about the real reason, her dog is spending more and more time with dear Aunt Ve and it is breaking her heart.  She is in awe of the fact she is able to spend time with her mom.....HER MOM!  And the thought of a possible murderer running amok in the darling little Enchanted Village is all sending her to the edge.I highly, HIGHLY recommend reading not only this story, but grab them all!

781,"Copycat Killer by Laura Scott has Willow Emery finding her brother and sister-in-law dead with their toddler, Lucy crying nearby.  The killings are identical to a crime that occurred twenty years prior.  Detective Nate Slater and his K-9 partner, Murphy take the traumatized pair home to find Willow’s apartment ransacked.  Are the crimes tied together?  Slater works to keep Willow and Lucy safe while searching for the elusive criminal.  As Slater spends time with Willow, he begins to fall for her.  Slater knows, though, that marriage and family are not in his future.  Can Willow change his mind?  Copycat Killer is the first book in True Blue K-9 Unit:  Brooklyn series. We are introduced to the staff of the newly formed Brooklyn K-9 Unit.  Detective Nate Slater is nearby when Willow calls 9-1-1.  He is surprised at the similarities to a 20-year-old cold case where the killer left 4-year-old Penelope McGregor as the only witness.  Her older brother, Bradley was at a sleepover.  Bradley is now a K-9 officer with their unit and Penelope is the desk clerk.  I thought Copycat Killer was a suspenseful story.  There is action that kept the book moving forward at a fast pace.  I liked the camaraderie between the members of the K-9 unit and how sweet they were to Lucy.  I, of course, loved following the investigation as they searched for the guilty party.  The romance is sweet and natural.  I was amazed at the talents of the K-9 dogs.  They have amazing sniffers.  I was disappointed that the murder investigation is not wrapped up in Copycat Killer.  I hope we get the answers in the next True Blue K-9 Unit:  Brooklyn novel.  I especially enjoyed Willow’s strong faith and how she shared it with Lucy and Nate.  Copycat Killer is an intriguing suspense with clever canines, a crazed killer, a cute kid, an affectionate aunt and determined detectives.*I voluntarily read an advanced copy of this book.

782,"The cover of this book implies that it is about the ingredients in the food we eat and whether or not some are bad for us.  The author does touch on this subject but very briefly.  The bulk of the book is about testing methods for food, sun screen, and cigarettes.  The author's argument is that all testing methods are flawed in some way, that a perfect test or study is pretty much impossible, and therefore we can all live on a diet of cookies, fried snacks, and sugary soda without giving it a second thought.  It is almost as if the author is biased in favor of the junk food industry.  If you are looking for a book that actually discusses the strange chemistry of what we put in us and on us, and whether some of it is good or bad, keep looking, as this is not that book.

There is a lot of inspiration through hilarious comments and uplifting stories.  I found this book to be thought-provoking and something that stuck with me after I finished it.I would recommend this book for readers that enjoy exploring their own abilities and looking to find some ideas to help them embrace themselves and find confidence in who they are.

784,"This book contains some good insight into the Warriors' championship run, but for me, there are places where the author's syntax, as well as his assumption that the reader has intimate knowledge of the context of what he is writing about makes for some difficult reading.  I found myself having to reread entire paragraphs either to 1) decode an awkwardly written sentence, or 2) get enough information to Google whatever he was talking about in order to gain the context necessary to understand his point.  All that said, the author does reveal some interesting character traits/flaws (?) of NBA players, front office staff, coaches and agents, and provides insight into the daily workings of an NBA team.  If you are a Warriors fan, this may help with the stress of a down year and shortened season.  I'm not so sure it would be quite as interesting if you weren't a Warriors fan, or if it had been written about, say, the Thunder or the Knicks.  But even then, there are worse ways to spend your time as you  shelter-in-place.",3,0,1029,0.141,1

786,"This is a delightful book that is part memoir, part recipe book.  I needed a reprieve from reading anything ""heavy"" during this time, and this was the lighthearted reverie that I craved.  First of all, it's only 256 pages, but when you hit approximately the 60% mark, the biography ends and the recipes begin. I cheerfully skimmed over those, since they harken back to foods and desserts that were integral parts of her life story sprinkled throughout the book.Phyllis reaches as far back as her great grandparents, and each relative has a cooking or baking anecdote as part of their story.  She talks about being eleven years old and mysteriously losing fifteen pounds.  For some reason at that time she doesn't ""know"" hunger, but finds confidence and calm in baking to feed others.  As she says, ""You just follow the rules; there is comfort in the logic"".  The next year her appetite returns.After high school graduation, Phyllis travels to New York City and Juilliard, chasing her dream of being a ballet dancer.  Her mother leaves her with a book of handwritten recipes.  Phyllis is body shamed into losing more weight to strike that ballet dancer physique.  Eventually she has an epiphany that she'd like to try being a pastry chef.  I was fascinated by her tenure training in a very hectic restaurant.  She started out in the pastry area, but soon expressed interest in moving over to being a regular chef.  I loved reading about all the things she sliced and diced, including accidentally cutting her own self in the process.  She has a way with describing food preparation that is poetic and uplifting.I loved reading about her life in New York City.  It was there that she met her future husband.  Phyllis discusses her marriage, children, career moves, and life in general.  It was a sort of easy, breezy, ironic and overall fun book.  It was consumed very fast and was satisfying, like I'm sure a lot of her scrumptious recipes are at the end of the book!Thank you to the publisher Farrar, Straus and Giroux / Macmillan for providing an advance reader copy via Edelweiss.",4,0,2082,0.185,1

Kate’s dog, Oliver suddenly begins digging frantically and uncovers a skeleton with pirate clothes.  They wonder if the skeleton is Sir George Bly, the pirate who founded the town and the reason they have the annual pirate festival.  Kate has enough on her plate with baking unique items for the pirate festival and the unknown skeleton.  But then her ex-fiancé, Evan arrives in town with an agenda.  Kate keeps herself busy (aka avoiding Evan) by investigating the legend of Sir George Bly with the book club hoping they can learn the truth about the gentleman pirate and his long-lost treasure.  What happens when they learn the skeleton is more recent than a four-hundred-year-old pirate? Sugar and Vice is the second A Cookie House Mystery.  It can be read on its own for those new to the series.  Kate is a likeable young woman with a talent for baking.  I love her dog, Oliver with his exuberance.  Kate loves to bake, and she creates delicious items for the bakery.  I enjoy the interactions between Maxi and Kate.  I did find the chapters too short and there were too many of them (68).  It made the book choppy.  The mystery was simple and could easily be solved long before the reveal.  But the mystery does suit the book.  It is a lighthearted cozy mystery with the focus on baking and friendship than the whodunit.  There are lovely descriptions of the town which has friendly residents.  I could have done without the Spanish words or phrases used by Maxi.  They are not explained which is frustrating (I was never able to master Spanish).  I did enjoy the humor and the descriptions of Kate’s baked items.  Sugar and Vice is a fun cozy mystery with a peppy pooch, tasty treats, pirate plunder, a bothersome ex-beau, and a screwy skeleton.*I voluntarily read an advanced copy of this book.

791,"Prepare to have your mind blown to smithereens.  Shorefall, the second book in Bennett's Founders series, takes the story and the ideas first posited in Foundryside and doesn't just build on them, but blasts those ideas to the stratosphere.  This is a thrilling, engaging, exciting sequel that takes the reader on a strange journey through one of the most unique fantasy worlds ever created.Tevanne is a city state in this world which is built on the sea and has numerous canals and mountains.  It feels a bit like a medieval Venice, but it's not.  Great merchant houses rule the city and off in the distant islands are great slave-operated plantations.  There are sailing ships and merchant ships. But, the most remarkable thing is the magical technology.  Imagine how well carriages would work if the wheels wanted to turn or if arrows wanted to find their targets or gates wanted to stay closed unless someone with permissions opens them.  Commands, like computer codes, are inscribed in gates, boats, lights, and walls,  Buildings are strong because the walls want to stay together.  This is the source of Tevanne's wealth and the civilization's advances.And this technology was first discovered by the ancients, the Hierophants, who lived three thousand years ago and wielded powers beyond description.  And now something from that past has been awakened from its slumber and it's coming.  And, well, nothing will ever be the same.Part of what makes this series work do well is that the main characters are not superheroes or leaders.  Sancia is a tiny little dirty thief who just happens to be scrived, meaning she can hear the scrived doors and walls and gates talk and can argue with their commands.  Together with a motley crew of Berenice, Orso, Gregory, and Clef (yes, he's back), its up to Sancia to save the world.On the way, we learn so much about the scrivings and the permissions and what can be described ne to alter reality.  We also learn about mind control, telepathy, shared minds, trust, fear, love, time, dimensions, horror, and the very fabric of reality.All in all, an absolutely awesome fantasy novel.",5,0,2127,0.176,0

She had fond memories of her own girlhood copy of ""Heidi"" which was a substantial hard-back book.  This edition of ""Heidi' was the only one available at Amazon.com that had the entire original text and was not abridged or adapted for younger children.  In that respect, the book did live up to its promise.  However, it was cheaply and shoddily made, the pages were thin and looked as if they had been printed on a computer, and it does not look as if it will hold up for more than one reading.

801,"Author, Shelby Law Ruttan, has worked hard to create a cookbook that will make life easier for those that follow the Paleo Diet.  The beginning of the book includes a brief discussion of what Paleo is, how it differs from  Keto and what the potential benefits of eating this way might be.  Being a busy mom herself, she set out to create recipes that could be accomplished in an average of 45 minutes with roughly 10 ingredients made from a universe of easily sourced, Paleo friendly ingredients.  The recipes for the slow cooker are obviously much longer.Ruttan provides a list of equipment, pantry essentials, a one sheet of foods that are good, ok and to avoid and tips for prepping and storing food.  There are 6 categories of recipes: EGGS AND BREAKFAST, SOUPS AND STEWS, VEGETABLE MAINS, SEAFOOD AND SHELLFISH, POULTRY, BEFF AND PORKThe recipes are laid out simply with no pictures of finished products. They begin by announcing the exclusions in bold green type: DAIRY FREE, EGG FREE, NUT FREE, MEATLESS  This is followed by a short paragraph describing the recipes or offering tips on how to enhance or change them.  Under the paragraph is Servings, Prep Time, Cook TimeA list of ingredients is along side a numbered set of directions under which are the macronutrient details: FAT, PROTEIN, CARBS in % - followed by the nutritional information: Calories, Total Fat, Sat Fat, Protein, Total Carb, Fiber,Net Carb, Cholesterol in grams, all by serving.The cookbook is laid out well and I haven’t tested the recipes to see if the times listed are good but by looking at them, my educated guess is that they’re going to be close, if your pantry is appropriately stocked.  My issue with the book is with the cost for the package.  There are no pictures and with 100 recipes, there’s nothing that really distinguishes this book as exceptional.  IMO, it would be a better value at 12.99All things considered, fills a specific niche in Paleo cooking but perhaps a bit over priced 📚",3,0,1981,0.104,1
802,"From the art work on the cover and the description of the story in the synopsis, I expected something totally different and to be fair to the author, I think it should be know that I eventually stopped reading this book.  From the first few pages I thought it was going to be something I really enjoyed because of the prose which to me were quite well written, literary in fact.  Then the story became depressive in my opinion, focusing on the loneliness of Missy the main character who in part was contributing to her own misery.  In fact, focusing on her losses vs. what she had or could have had if she stepped outside of herself to make some human connections was contributing to her grief.  One sees glimpses of her desire to change the situation but unfortunately, I did not stay with the book long enough to see if that was something in her future.  The book employs ""looks back"" to significant points in Missy's life (in the nursing profession, it is called reminiscence therapy and is a therapeutic intervention for older people to connect with themselves, to do a life review as one searches for self actualization), so this seemed like something that would be good to use as a literary tool by the author to bring life to the character of Missy. And it does, as the reader gets glimpses of Missy's life beginning with her college years and on to how she met her husband who has since passed away.  Then the adult language of the book took over from the literary side and it went down hill for me from then on.  Between the language and the depression (and in fact fear on the part of the main character), was too pervasive for me.  For those who can stick with it to the end, maybe there is redemption in the pages that I did not read.  While I would have liked to have delved deeper into the promise of the ""love story"" to come,  I personally just could not stick it out long enough to find out.",2,1,1907,0.079,0

Marty Balin had just died the night before.  I've never been a big reader of biographies, let along autobiographies, so I didn't really expect to like it.I certainly didn't expect to find myself glued to the pages, nodding and chuckling in rueful recognition at some of the youthful escapades, fascinated at the first-person account of the development of the SF music scene in the 60s, and feeling like I was getting to know someone who had been just sort of a fuzzy iconic image of a rock star in my mind previously.  I wouldn't have called myself a fan; I liked his recorded stuff from way back when, but I'd never heard them live before that concert.

807,"Series Info/Source: This is a stand alone book.  I got an eGalley to review through NetGalley.Story (5/5): This was an amazing book.  The whole story has this fantasy dust bowl type of feel to it.  Elysium was like any other town until the Dust Soldiers came and the Gods returned.  Now Elysium is isolated from the rest of the world and its denizens are part of a 10 year old game being held between the Gods of Life and Death.  Then Sal comes along and breaks it all. This was a very unique story that is an interesting blend of magic, survival, and interactions with selfish gods.  This amazing story was very creative and engaging and I loved how it was written.  I could not put this down.Characters (5/5):  I loved the characters; especially Sal and Asa and the gang of girls they stumble upon.  However, even the side characters are really well done.  They were so intriguing and engaging.  Sal is struggling to learn her magic and Asa is trying to figure out to fit into the human body he’s been given.  I also love that this isn’t your typical boy meets girl type of love story wrapped in a fantasy setting.Setting (5/5):  Again this is amazing.  Most of this story takes place in a sort of pocket dust bowl world that’s been set apart in time.  It’s a creative and interesting setting and the description throughout is spectacular; I swear I could almost taste the dust in my mouth and feel the heat on my back while I read this.Writing Style (5/5):  The writing style was incredible.  Everything comes alive for the reader and there is an urgency to it that makes it hard to put down.  This is one of those books that almost read itself for me; I was just completely sucked into this world!Summary (5/5):  Overall I loved this and will be keeping an eye out for Pentecost’s future books.

Asher is lighthearted, carefree & a people pleaser.The story is told hopscotching across the days of Asher & Sidney's summer vacation with their families.  It's almost like a collage of anecdotes between the two over a span of time.It's frequently amusing, though occasionally frustrating.The book felt like it dragged in the 2nd half, & I'm not entirely sure why - the pacing of days instead of chapters made it seem longer in a way; but at the same time, I enjoyed the anecdotes from each & could see where they did help build the story in a way that was pretty believable, so maybe it was just me.The one point that frustrated me was that we didn't get to hear Asher's response to Sidney telling him about what started it all - that was very pertinent to their past & future.Overall, I really enjoyed the story BUT some discretion is advised:*******Clean romance level/Parental Caveat*******This book is ""sweet"" rather than ""clean"".  There are passionate makeout sessions with petting that isn't graphically detailed but still intimates enough to generate some... heat.The parents of the 2 have regularly left the 2 of them with virtually no oversight all the years they've vacationed together, even after they're sharing a home & have rooms adjoining a shared bathroom.At one point, the two begin cuddling on Asher's bed & eventually regularly sleeping together (definitely literally; whether or not there's anything more is unstated).  Even mature adults placed in such intimate proximity would have difficulty resisting temptation. Sidney could easily have ended up pregnant*Language:  1 use of d-mn, 1 use of d--k, a dozen each of h-ll & sh-t*Religion:  around a dozen uses of the Lord's Name in vain, sadly & totally unnecessarily, though at least none as curses (using a lower case g doesn't change that - unless you add an s to the end)",5,0,1967,0.145,1
810,"There were a lot of parts I appreciated about this book, the fact that he was such a self made man not the least of them.  His story in the beginning, as a poor kid in Canada, was extremely well written and interesting and I really was rooting for him.  However, once he hit the big time he just seemed way too full of himself, and a good 1/3 of the book alternated between bluster and name dropping.  Ho hum.  Admittedly, when his clubs made their meteoric rise I was about a decade past clubbing, but even still I certainly had a fairly good knowledge of pop culture during that era so how is it I've never heard of him or any of his clubs -- particularly if he was ""all over the news"" with his arrest.  Does he have a score to settle?  Absolutely.  And I don't envy anyone on the receiving end of a Guiliani crusade.  But even still, I think this book might only hold the interest of people who actually knew him.",3,0,916,0.119,1

Since I am not an innate/ instinctive cook, I really love how Pamela offers tips for HOW to cook things, not just giving the recipes.  And she offers a lot of nutrition information that I just wouldn't get anywhere else--toxins, good proteins, etc.  I'm a gen x'er who wasn't exactly raised on legumes!!

815,"4 StarsA Sarcastic, Sassy, & Smart Read!  In short, “A Bad Day for Sunshine” has it all!Del Sol, New Mexico has a new Sheriff.  Her name is Sunshine Vicram and she is bad a$$.  Sarcastic, smart as a whip and sassy to boot.  She and her teenage daughter Auri are quite the pair.  Let’s just say that their relationship is the bomb.  They are quirky, hysterically funny and their witty banter makes them the envy of friends and foe.Sunshine and Auri make a great team as well, which is an asset when a teenage girl who has befriended Auri goes missing.  Then it’s all hands on deck.  Good thing the Sheriff works with her trusted best friend Quincy, who is good for laughs as well as for being a brilliant detective.Then there’s Levi Ravinder.  He’s the best tracker in Del Sol who gives Sunshine heart palpitations.  If anyone can find the missing teen, it’s Levi.  Unfortunately for Sunshine, she’s had a crush on him forever and now she has to work with the guy.From start to finish, “A Bad Day for Sunshine” by Darynda Jones was brilliant.  The witty back and forth banter between Sunshine and Auri brought an instant smile to my face.  I adored this mother and daughter pair and thought to myself:  If only all mothers and daughters were like this!  The sarcastic humor laced throughout the novel often made me laugh hysterically, whether it was between Sunshine and Auri, Sunshine and Quincy or any other characters in this novel.  You can tell that the author crafted the relationships very carefully and they worked beautifully.  Even though Sunshine has had a crush on Ravinder for a long time, other potential relationships were explored and each one was scintillating!  I was hooked!  Having loved both Sunshine and Auri I must say that I can’t wait for the next novel in this series to be published and will be waiting with bated breath for its release!This was a fabulous buddy read with Kaceey!Thank you to NetGalley, St. Martin’s Press and Darynda Jones for the arc.Published on Goodreads on 4.18.20.",4,0,2013,0.272,0
816,"I really enjoyed this book!  I have been wanting to read Darynda Jones's work for a very long time but just haven't fit it into my reading schedule yet for one reason or another.  As soon as I saw this book, I knew that this would be one that I would have to read.  I really like the fact that this is the start of a brand new series and that is a very different premise than the books in her popular series.  This story hooked me from the beginning and entertained me until the final page.Sunshine Vicram is the new sheriff in town.  She's not really sure how that happened since she didn't even know she was running but that is something that her parents will need to explain.  She has moved back home with her daughter, Auri, and hopes to ease herself into her new position but that is not meant to be.  Before she knows what is going on, she must lead a search to find a couple of missing teenagers and deal with a few other cases hitting her small town.I found this to be a rather exciting story.  There were several different mysteries that Sunshine had to deal with and I liked how she was able to juggle the workload.  I really liked the characters and appreciated getting to know about their past slowly as the story progressed.  I was delighted to not only follow Sunshine on her adventures but to also get the opportunity to see things from her daughter's point of view.  I really liked that the characters in this story had a wonderful sense of humor.  I thought that the added humor helped to offset some of the more serious moments.I would definitely recommend this book to others.  I found this to be a wonderful start to a very promising series.  I fell in love with the characters and was captivated by the rather complex mystery.  I look forward to reading future installments in this series.I received a digital review copy of this book from Macmillan - St. Martin's Press via Edelweiss.",4,0,1906,0.239,0

He has nothing against Georgie – he likes her, but he has never thought of her that way and is not sure he can…Georgie is angry, she escaped Freddie Oaks, the dastard that kidnapped her and tried to force her to elope, but instead of praising her for her ability to save herself, the ton has deemed her ruined!  Her choices are marry Freddie – not in this lifetime – or retire to the country and live out her life as a spinster.  Neither option is appealing so she should be overjoyed when Nicholas proposes…Georgie doesn’t want Nicholas’ pity proposal and makes her refusal crystal clear – but later when she has had time to think, she knows she has made a huge mistake.  As luck would have it, Freddie decides to made a late-night visit to Georgie’s window and ends up in need of medical attention – good thing Georgie knows a soon-to-be doctor!!  After helping him tend Freddie, Georgie confesses she made a mistake and asks if she may reconsider, Nicholas proposes again and this time she accepts. Could it be that a scandal was exactly what they needed to see what has been there all along?This was a well written, very sweet, friends to lovers story.  Nicholas and Georgie are very likable and their transition from friends to lovers is believable and entertaining.  The book is filled with witty banter, has lots of cats, well-meaning parents, a slow burning romance that ignites into passion and a very satisfying HEA – it is a bit slow at points and there is not a lot of drama/conflict – but if you are looking for a light, amusing, uncomplicated, feel-good read – look no further, this is that book!!

820,"I've been reading Anne Perry's books for over 25 years and have enjoyed every single one.  I like the new Daniel Pitt series as it contains intriguing plots and well-developed characters.  This series had a great start with ""Twenty-One Days"" and ""Triple Jeopardy"" so I was really looking forward to this latest book.  I like that Thomas and Charlotte Pitt from Perry's previous series play a prominent role, but don't overtake the story.  Daniel has a lot to learn in the legal profession but he is bright and has a hunger for justice.  The boss's daughter, Miriam, also plays a prominent role in assisting Daniel with his work.  Obviously brilliant, she leads a life restrained by contemporary norms.  This adds a tension to the story not seen in the Monk or Thomas Pitt series.I recommend ""One Fatal Flaw.""

Bonnie Tsui delves into the history of swimming, as well as relates some remarkable stories of swimmers who were winners, survivors and warriors.  Tsui is an engaging writer and, as a swimmer herself, is able to capture the magical and meditative aspects of being in the water.  My adult daughter, a lifelong distance swimmer, loved this book!  Her comments:  “It is wonderful to have someone describe the very perception I have of what it is like to be in the water, and to know that someone shares my joy of swimming and also feels how special it is.”  As her mother and a recreational splasher, I felt that Tsui articulates that joy well and helped me understand the depth of my daughter’s feelings about swimming.I won this book in a Goodreads giveaway, so thank you to Goodreads, publisher Algonquin Books, and the author for this hardcover book.

822,"What a heart wrenching story about postpartum depression.  After their beloved patriarch dies four siblings are faced with clearing out his house.  Nothing prepares them for the utter chaos they find in his attic.  As they dig through the mess, they discover a series of paintings and their corresponding letters.  Letters penned by their long dead mother.  It’s a shocking discovery that changes everything they thought they knew about their father and their long dead mother.I think this novel shows exactly how debilitating postpartum depression is for some women.  Hopefully it will help foster more understanding of the condition, and help these women get the help they so desperately need.  The book is very well written and I thought the plot was really creative in dealing with a difficult subject.  For the most part the story really saddened me although it did end on a bright note.

823,"At the beginning of the twentieth century, some thought being able to fly was impossible - but that didn’t stop the efforts of the Wright Brothers and in Germany, Count von Zeppelin.  While America advanced to wooden rattletrap planes held together by glue and baling wire, Zeppelin was finding success with an airship  - a giant bag of hydrogen that could glide almost noiselessly 2-3000 feet in the air, where passengers could revel in the sights below from comfortable armchairs.  Zeppelin’s protege, was Hugo Eckaner, who was committed as he was.  In the 1920’s Eckaner made a flight around the world on the Graf Zeppelin.  He also made a flight across the Atlantic three years before Lindbergh.Eckaner found himself in a serious competition with a man named Juan Trippe in America, who believed that the need for passenger travel internationally would be served best  with his fleet of airplanes - he disdained the “fragile” airship.  While Trippe seemed to have no trouble financing his fleet, Eckaner, as the Nazi influence was being felt and was growing in Germany, was having problems finding what he needed.  Since the airship continued to be popular, Trippe and his wife booked a trip on a a tour, and saw that the airship provided luxuries his planes did not.Trippe upgraded his planes, while Eckaner decided that his competition was the luxurious ocean liner, like the Queen Mary, and upgraded his airships.  He planned to build his masterpiece - the largest  zeppelin In the air - and he called it the Hindenberg.We learn a lot about the Hindenberg.  It had made ten transatlantic trips prior to the October, 1936 last flight to Lakehurst, NJ.  We learn how it was configured, how it was fueled, and how it took off and landed.  Much attention is paid to the Lakehurst landing, which for reasons unknown, was handled differently than any of the others. Weather was a complication, but only caused a delay.  Since the Hindenberg had undergone “Nazification” (Several of those at the controls were Nazis)  there was a bit of rumble  about a possible bomb. As it turned out, the cause of the fire and crash were due to over-stressing the structure due to unusual turns at the landing.All during Eckaner’s experience with the airship, he was in serious competition with Juan Trippe, who was determined to make his Pan American Airlines the only way to fly.  There was no competition when it came to the trip times - for speed, Trippe’s fleet always beat everyone and he was improving safety and comfort every year.I thoroughly enjoyed this long story of the “race” to bring safe flight to our skies.  There were difficult times during the war years, but aircraft design enjoyed a burst of upgrades that brought innovation to commercial planes as well.The journey from the Wright Brothers and the early airships to what we have today is fascinating - and this book fills in a lot of blanks.  For those who love everything that flies - this is a great read!",5,0,2965,0.144,1
824,"Tim Keller recently described this book as “case studies,” and indeed, it is full of life stories from diverse Christ-followers, stories that inform one's imagination on how we might engage with our neighbors and co-workers who see and experience life differently.  Though not prescriptive, it is descriptive of people who are seeking to be a faithful presence in the world.  I highly recommend this book to those who are serious about following Jesus and interested in more effectively engaging with the people around us.  Collectively, the stories provide a thoughtful, measured exploration of both the difficulties and possibilities of diverse perspectives.I’ve served in a local church with two of the contributors, John Inazu, who was our Youth Director at that time (and had a great impact on our son), and Warren Kinghorn, an elder.  John, who during his years at our church was also earning his PhD in law,  served with a wonderful mix of leadership and humility, effectively engaging  teenagers, volunteers and parents.  Warren's intelligence and wisdom mark his leadership on our Session, and I have especially appreciated the true biblical gentleness with which he offers his perspective.  Several contributing authors I knew of, while others were new to me; but each gave me new things to ponder.  I find myself reflecting both logically and prayerfully on their intriguing experiences.The stories present no pat answers but an encouragement to move toward people--to engage, confident of the message of Life we’ve been given, but humble in our recognition of our own fallenness.  The writers show that engagement is not always easy and sometimes daunting, but we are to keep moving forward, faithful and gentle at the same time. In an age of divisive and unkind discourse, Uncommon Ground provides hopeful, welcome guidance toward loving and understanding one another.",5,0,1881,0.202,1

Most people just get manipulated.Beyond challenging journalists to do their jobs, the book issues a challenge to all Americans to live up to our country's legacy; making the most of what so many patriots have sacrificed so much for in our past.Not to give too much away, but the forefathers never envisioned a public who wastes time complaining about all the little things and cannot take a challenge or hard task without playing the victim or thinking the government should have been there to help them out.I'll pass this one along to family and friends.

I liked A Spool of Blue Thread well enough, but didn't love it, and I liked Redhead By The Side Of The Road too, but kind of feel the same way.  I thought it kind of a monotone read following the day-to-day life of a kind, persnickety man in his forties.Now, don't get me wrong, I did like Micah Mortimer, truly a 'character' set in his ways.  I liked his easy going way of life, his welcoming manner, his crazy family, and smiled at some of his customers and their absurd computer tech questions.  But, overall, for me , an average plus read.  Am still looking forward to reading The Accidental Tourist and the other half dozen Anne Tyler books on my shelf, but hoping there's a little more ""pop"".So....if you're looking for an easy-to read, relaxing, stress-free novel by a talented writer, definitely recommend REDHEAD BY THE SIDE OF THE ROAD.",3,0,963,0.29,0

831,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  It covers the origin in England of the distinct group of people who became known as Pilgrims, who settled Plymouth, as well as their time in Holland before heading to America.  The personalities of various individual Pilgrims are carefully and sympathetically sketched for the reader, and they come across as interesting people very far removed from what we would consider our American experience.  They are also quite different from the beloved but hokey myths about Pilgrims, which are gently but convincingly debunked.My favorite part of the book is the section on King Philip's War, a conflict that deserves more attention than it gets.  This volume is a nice complement to another book more completely focused on King Philip's War, ""Our Beloved Kin: A New History of King Philip’s War"" by Lisa Brooks, which is a wonderful read as well.

The surgery is followed by a strict diet, this surgery is done in a day and a hospital stay is not needed.The gastric sleeve removes part of the stomach and shrinks it so there is less room to store food and patients feel fuller faster.The gastric bypass reduces the stomach size and the patient feels full after eating a small amount of food.You are then given information about insurance coverage conditions and risks during surgery.You are then given a diet to use after surgery that is done in stages that  includes fluids including water, broth, sugar - free popsicles, and whey protein fruit juice.A list of nut milks are given, along with thinned mashed potatoes and broth, and pureed soups.The next stage is the amber stage of soft, pureed, textured food.The last stage is the Green stage, which consists of high protein, low sugar, low fat foods.You are then shown what sugar does to the body and the mind, and why it is so important to get off sugar.You are given a list of food to avoid, gum, tough meat, rice, pasta, pineapple, mushrooms and corn.You are introduced to bariatric utensils and plates that are labeled with “veg, starch and protein.” This is so that you eat the right portions of each.It is important to have a support group to help you maintain your diet, if you are married, your spouse could be your support, they may even want to do the diet with you.Drinking 10-15 cups of water a day helps you to feel full and it washes your food down, drink more water if it is hot outside.The recipes in the book are color coded according to your stage in the process.The spiced oat, apple and coconut smoothie bowl uses rolled oats, coconut water, yogurt, bananas and coconut to create a smoothie that tastes good and is easily digestible.The granola and fruit breakfast tarts granola, agave, yogurt, coconut and fruit to create a tart that tastes like a dessert.The apple and lentil soup uses apples, lentils, carrots, celery, yogurt and bouillon to create a thick, flavorful soup.A bariatric tortilla pizza is made with tortillas, ham, tomato paste, tomatoes, anchovies and mozzarella and can be baked in 10 minutes.Satay chicken skewers are easy to make and only use a few ingredients - chicken, soy sauce and pepper that are marinated overnight and cooked in minutes.Hoisin glazed shrimp use shrimp, hoisin sauce, asparagus, vermicelli noodles and spices can be prepared and cooked in 15 minutes - much faster than takeout!You will also find chilis, fish dinners, dips, dressings and desserts that will please your palate and satisfy your food cravings!",5,0,3044,0.088,1
836,"'Banned Book Club' by Kim Hyun Sook and Ryan Estrada with art by Hyung-Ju Ko is a biographical graphic novel about a college student in Korea in the early 1980s.When Kim Hyun Sook started college in 1983, she joined a book club.  What she didn't know is that it was a subversive group and that joining it would put her in danger.  She had friends stopped by the police and even arrested.  Her parents owned a restaurant and had no idea what their daughter was doing.  The student protests eventually led to leader changes and voting in South Korea.I really liked this story of being young and naive, but wanting to make a difference.  The danger and fear is real, but the story still has some light moments along the way.  The art is really great.  I really liked this story based on true events.I received a review copy of this graphic novel from Iron Circus Comics in exchange for an honest review.

837,"Any book with William and JA Johnstone as the author is guaranteed to be a good book that lets you escape into the old west and leave the laundry until later.  Each series has an anchor character, this one is Matt Jenson, son of another Johnstone character, Smoke Jensen.  Matt Jensen's story is a cross between the mountain men and western settings that the Johnstones are famous for writing.Matt's story has him travelling the west after picking up stakes to provide his particular brand of security during a horse drive to market.  The easy job he thought he was signing on for becomes a different kind of fight every day as the drive faces challenges on all fronts.  But being a Jensen means our hero has more skills than the bad guys thought.  The adventure is set in well defined, descriptive, back stories of wealth vs the rest of the world.  Matt becomes the equalizer that lets the good guys battle to win.  An outstanding story that was exciting from start to finish.",5,0,977,0.205,0
838,"I received a free ARC of this book through Vine Voice.  The plot sounded intriguing but the execution was poor.  Though the content of the book is for adults (depression, dementia, and abortions) the book is written at a middle grade or high school level.  This is one of those books that could have been so much more.The story is told from the perspective of Beth Walsh from 1996-97 as she and her three siblings with putting their elderly father into hospice care for dementia.  While packing up his house, she discovers some strange paintings and journal entries in the attic.  The Walsh children were told that their mother died in a car accident years ago, but her journal tells another story.  Beth is also dealing with feeling overwhelmed with a new baby.  The second perspective is from Grace Walsh and the journals she kept from 1957-58.  She is also overwhelmed with having children and an unhelpful drunken husband.  She has obvious postpartum depression.  When she is pregnant with her fifth child, she reaches out to her feminist and independent sister for help.  Her sister Maryanne helps her to get a back room abortion that goes very badly.  The third perspective is from Maryanne, who reluctantly steps in to help her brother-in-law raise his children when Grace goes missing.While this book is pitched in part as a family mystery, I found the entire plot to be very predictable and at times unbelievable.  Beth, like her mother, suffers from postpartum depression but no one seems to have a clue.  And Beth is a psychologist!  I wish the author would have provided more information about abortions and contraceptive options.  The situation for women was just beginning to change in the late 1950’s and I would have loved it if Ms. Rimmer had focused more in that direction.  Overall, I thought that the story telling could have been more powerful given the subject matter.  Instead, it seemed more like a beach read.",2,0,1934,0.148,1

She loves her husband Patrick but back in the fifties children and home where the woman’s responsibility, Grace starts writing notes about how she feels and hides them away, the last thing Grace wants is another baby and when this happens she asks her sister Maryanne to help.It is now 1996 and Beth is the youngest of Grace and Patrick’s children she is mother to a five month old son, Patrick is not well and the four children Tim, Ruth Jeremy and Beth decide that it is time for him to go into care and Beth start cleaning the house in the attic she comes across a series of notes from her mother Grace which turns their lives upside down they had always been told their mother died in a car accident and the need to uncover the truth and not upset their father is a must.MS Rimmer is such a fabulous story teller she takes on issues that are relevant in today’s society with caring and compassion, I loved getting to know the three main storytellers in this book, Grace, Beth and Maryanne and hearing their views on mental illness, life in the fifties and the nineties and how illnesses are treated so differently times have changed so much, Tim Ruth and Jeremy and their spouses added a lot to this story, I loved it from start to finish, there were many tears and lots of tissues used and so much love in this story, this is one that I highly recommend, thank you MS Rimmer and Hachette for such a fabulous and moving story.",5,0,1915,0.186,1
840,"This book builds on the concepts developed by Clayton Christensen and provides similarly compelling examples from the world.  That's certainly true, yet what I found most useful about the book is that it's both complete and practical.Complete in that it covers all the phases of strategy from vision through implementation.  Most strategy books stop at the vision and actions phase, but this book does a good job of defining the implementation phase of strategy.  In my experience, those who can implement a strategy are the ones who make a real impact on the world.And practical in the same way Christensen's writing always was.  Put another way, it's a toolbox that can be deployed by leaders and professionals across industries and at various levels.  Thinking out 5-10 years and walking back today is a practical way for us all to create more meaningful impact.  Especially needed in the world of today full of short term thinking.Good book.",5,0,945,0.124,1
841,"This book is an open prompt into what mystery author's find interesting in their lives.  Some are personal experiences, some are literary inspirations, some are literary criticism.  Many of these have the author's characteristic style attached to the writing.  Some are different and more autobiographical but no less interesting.Although there are quite a number of the usual bestseller mystery authors represented, there are some midlister's that are not normally covered in these anthologies are really interesting.  Martin Limon's military experience and how it influences the Sueno and Bascom series and Steph Cha's writing about the difference between fear and paranoia with the realization that the urge for fight or flight can be shut down.  It is my hope that after you read some of these vignettes, that their experiences in writing would tempt you toward starting one of their books.

842,"I have lived the keto lifestyle for 2 years now and am looking for new ways to learn and ramp up my menus.  My daughters have celiac and the doctor has suggested periodic cleanses.  I thought perhaps this book would help me take my own keto cleanse.This book has a sturdy paperback with a matte photo cover.  The pages are typical weight and the binding is strong.  I was unable to find any manufacturing flaws.  The font they chose is clear and printed in a size to make it easy to read without feeling like they are trying to fill pages.This book starts with 57 pages explaining the keto diet, what foods to eat vs avoid, different kinds of cleanses and how to prepare for them, etc.  One of my pet peeves is diet books that start with a huge section explaining a diet or going off on bunny trails. It seems like most people who buy specific diet books are already familiar with that specific diet so a long section shouldn't be necessary.  I am also not a huge fan of meal plans -- do we really need to be told to cut our veggies ahead of using them or given a shopping list?  I prefer books lighter on fluff and heavier on information and recipes, although I recognize that other people do like this approach.Recipes in this book start on page 62 and end on page  189.  Many of the recipes are ones I was already familiar with, it's nice to have the tried and true.  The recipes are mostly simple and easy to cook, with easy to find ingredients.  The nutritional information is listed for each recipe, but as usual, you have to be careful to follow the serving size as it would be easy to blow out your daily carb limit.In general this is a nice book for someone looking to do a keto cleanse that is not familiar with keto.  I will be passing this book onto one of my friends, but I would recommend it for the new keto eater.",4,0,1829,0.102,1

844,"I debated a 3/4 rating.  The book reads like Dave talks on his shows.  Direct, comfortable and no BS.  Two thoughts came to mind as constructive criticism.  First, this book literally seeks to boil the ocean in addressing every possible issue/concern/contention we currently face.  I understand he may be interested in many topics, and he certainly set this book out as addressing many (all?) of today’s concerns, but perhaps Dave would be better served by focusing his insights on one (or maybe two) if he decides to write more.  Second, some citations (perhaps presented as endnotes) would be helpful.  For example, there are many statements in “Check Your Facts” chapter, and there are limited/no references to which the reader might resort to evaluate these statements.  I have no reason to believe that they are inaccurate.  I just have no time to try to follow the breadcrumbs that led to his conclusions.  Good effort on a first book.  I likely could not have done better.",4,0,979,0.128,1
845,"Paul Czarcik is a detective, par excellence.  His methods may not be exactly by the book, but he gets the job done.  He has a few vices, but in his book, some alcohol, a little cocaine and a heart to heart conversation with a hooker every now and then, never hurt anyone.  In this excellent debut thriller, Czarcik is after a serial killer who has a list of ""must kill"" victims that have only one trait in common, but the connection is such that it isn't until the killer reaches out to Czarcik, that the pieces fall into place.  Then the thrill of the ride really begins.I really enjoyed this book.  It was a great story, with interesting and unusual characters, and a pace that kept me turning pages fast!

That's where I first learned of the friendship between Loretta and Patsy.I think Patsy saw right off the bat how genuine and real Loretta is.  It is obvious to see as you read this book how much they each needed each other.  Their friendship was deep and real and rather than being competitive in a competitive business, they empowered each other.Tragic Patsy was taken before they had known each other even 2 years but amazing the impact she had in Loretta's life and career.If you are fortunate enough to have one friendship like this in your life, you are blessed.Last year we took our mom, also a Coal Miners Daughter to Loretta's big 87th birthday bash.

Without even knowing she was in the race.  There's a missing girl and Sunshine has to find and save her.This book tries too hard to be clever.

Thank goodness she fell out of love with that word.But Sunshine fell in love with everyone.  Correction – Sunshine fell in lust with everyone.  Even when her life was at stake.  That also got annoying.And although a couple of things were explained in the end, too many things were left hanging, ripe for a sequel.

This content is available in PDF format from other sources at no cost.  I found the PDF presentation to be much easier to use than the Kindle version.  The Kindle version did not include graphics and images which is a material omission for this material.  I found the Kindle presentation to be poor overall.

This book, like the first one, skipped around be a lot. There was a lot of jumping between character stories.  I don't mind multiple character stories being told congruently, per se.  It's when there are so many that it's easy to forget what has happened in one because the author hasn't been to some storylines in awhile - I as the reader have no idea what is going on it's been so long since the author has picked up this characters' storyline, I've now forgotten what's going on.

864,"I just finished reading Lyman Page’s  “the Little Book of Cosmology”  It is by far the most clear and succinct summary of the established key elements of our universe.  Page  put the components and physics in an orderly fashion so as to understand the structures and forces that we struggle with and continue to ask the same questions that open the doors to our continuing knowledge of the cosmos.  He brings in the cosmic microwave background ( CMB ) showing its relevance to the cosmological constant and the ever expanding university.  The critical role of matter in the grand scheme of our cosmos, and his brief and candid comments on dark matter and dark energy were moat appreciated.For those interested in exploring those key structures and the physics that determine their place in the universe, this is a succinct composition of our current understanding of the cosmos.  And it was done in 110 pages!J.  J.  M.",5,0,919,0.081,1
865,"Right up to the current minute, this lovely book contains many hot button issues without being preachy.  Antonia, the central character who has been dealt a double blow, triple or quadruple if you count outside influences, had immigrated from the Dominican Republic.  Her husband, who dies suddenly on the first page, was the town optometrist and was regarded as something of a local saint.  They live in a small Vermont town where she has just retired from her position as a professor of English Lit at a local college.But life intervenes and won't allow her to wallow in her grief, pulling her in several directions that as mentioned before, addresses the current immigration crisis, sisterly bonding, bi-polar illness, and answers the question of whether an up-to-date sticker on your car indicating you've donated to the policemen's guild save you from getting a ticket.  Gracefully written and incorporating quite a bit of humor, highly recommended.",5,0,954,0.094,0
866,"Tod Olson really knows how to tell a story.  Writing fiction can be challenging enough, with characters to develop, settings to keep track of, and plots to plot.  But narrative nonfiction requires the same skills combined with facts and research.  Into the Clouds tells the story of three expeditions undertaken with the goal of reaching the summit of K2, one of the tallest mountains in the world.  Considered to be even harder to climb than Mount Everest, efforts to climb K2 have led to incredible suffering and even death for those who have attempted it.  This book highlights three specific expeditions.  Two of those expeditions were led by Charlie Houston, in 1938 and 1953.  The second expedition was lead by Fritz Wiessner.The book is divided into three parts.  Each section highlights the events of one of these expeditions.  Sadly, none of these expeditions succeeded in reaching the summit.  But the stories of the incredible effort made are fascinating and mind-boggling.  It's astounding the price some people are willing to pay to accomplish a goal.  It was especially interesting to compare the three expeditions.  Houston's leadership put the needs of the team first.  Both expeditions turned around when the needs of the team required it.  Even then the results were devastating.  But Wiessner's team fell apart almost immediately leading to the deaths of four members of the expedition. Climbing a mountain with unpredictable weather, nightmarish terrain, and avalanche danger around every turn means you are literally putting your life on the line.  And yet for the men on these expeditions it was worth the gamble, at least at first.  Some of them came to regret their presence on the mountain, but by then it was too late.Olson tells a compelling tale of sacrifice and survival that leaves one wondering about the drive that leads people to take such risks.",5,0,1879,0.087,1
867,"It became clear to me early on that this book was written by its co-authors with a film dramatization in mind.  It’s all made-for-the-screen dialog, and action, action, action.  It’s full of 21st-century sensibility and language, too.If this were pure escapist fiction, this would be an entertaining lightweight read.  But Nancy Wake was a real person, and her true story deserves better than the slick, superficial drama presented in this book.  The authors confess to having “invented some episodes,” but in addition to many other fictionalized episodes, there is an entire lengthy series in the middle of the book that is completely made up and makes Nancy out to have acted for her own personal reasons, at the price of the lives of many of the resistant fighters under her command.  Not acceptable.If you want the real deal, I recommend you read Peter FitzSimons’s biography, Nancy Wake: A Biography of Our Greatest War Heroine.",2,0,933,0.146,1
868,"I must admit that I’m inclined to enjoy Dr. Smolin’s books.  He is passionate about physics and he communicates that passion to his readers.  That alone makes his books worth reading.  He also likes to try to poke holes in the popular theories of the field because he believes that these paradigms are holding us back from real progress.  He did that very well with string theory in The Trouble with Physics.  He did that much less well in Time Reborn.  Here he takes on quantum theory and falls somewhere in between.Smolin is excellent in bringing out the fact that the generally accepted interpretation of quantum mechanics is an anti-realist view.  Whereas Einstein’s general relativity tells us something about how the universe actually is (gravity warps space, thus giving reality to the action-at-a-distance concept that plagued Newton), the way quantum mechanics is generally explained leaves us with things that simply cannot be reality (most famously, Schrodinger’s cat being simultaneously alive and dead).  However, because the results of quantum mechanics are so closely aligned with observed results, physicists are often reluctant to tackle the reality question (or simply believe we live in an anti-real world).  Smolin finds this unsatisfying.  Frankly, as a physics Ph.D. student back in the day, I did too.Smolin is also quite good at describing how there have always been realist interpretations of quantum mechanics from theorists like de Broglie and Bohm, but these ideas were pushed aside in favor of Bohr’s and other’s anti-realist interpretation.  He points out that these realist interpretations can give the same mathematical results as the highly successful ones we all know; however, they have their own problems and lead to different ultimate outcomes.It is here that the book starts to leave the track a little bit, though it doesn’t completely derail.  Smolin describes a number of possible realist theories, along with their problems and potentials.  Unless you are well-versed or highly interested, the going gets tougher here.  It is difficult for the average reader to parse the differences between these theories and what following each would mean for the future of physics.  For the general public, I think he would have been better served by being less specific here and simply pointing us in the direction he would like us to go.And, ultimately, I guess part of the problem.  Dr. Smolin is not really speaking to the general public.  He is trying to move theoretical physics in a particular direction.  Even we laypeople with a passionate interest in physics have no real influence on what the vaunted minds of theoretical physics are going to pursue.  Though there is much here for the general public to enjoy, we still end up like outsiders looking in on an argument in which we cannot really join.",4,1,2839,0.134,1
869,"I am so glad I found Dan's book and made it part of my workout (running) routine.  I've found it makes the time pass by quickly.  Moreover, the content is very thought-provoking and inspiring.  It challenges one to be both mentally and physically tough as Dan relates stories and imparts sound advice on how to handle times of crisis, hardship, social media conflicts, and so on.  I have since found myself paying particular attention when he speaks on news outlets and I have become a member of some of his Facebook pages.  Overall, Dan is clearly a smart, articulate and well-grounded thought leader who I foresee as someone who will continue to rise in the ranks of his political party.

I have read a lot of books about meditation but this one is an utter delight because it looks fluffy and goes down like a strawberry milkshake but it’s really full of kale and spirulina - it will change your life and you will feel so much healthier.  Right now the world is crazy and we need support in being the ethical beings our meditation practice pushes us to be.  It’s hard to find that support but Devon and Craig deliver in this book which you can read at home and enjoy over and over again.  I highly recommend this book for anyone who has a strong meditation practice AND anyone at all.

874,"The Good Assassin follows the a mossad agent that leads an assignation squad against Herbert Cukurs also know as the Butcher of Latvia for execution squads he led to murder tens of thousands of Jews while commuting unspeakable tragedies against them. Cukurs who is described as the Latvian version of Charles Lindbergh for a harrowing flight to Africa and his apparent anti-Semitism was a dreamer who always wanted a role bigger than he had and was an adrenaline junky hooked on flying.  When the Nazi’s came in, he became the leader of a death squad committing “actions” against Jewish people that made them dig their own graves and often shot the families including those holding babies.  The first half of this book covers the time he was in Latvia and the years leading up to the fall of the Nazi regime and the Jews who managed to hide that would build the case against him.  It is VERY hard reading.The second half of the book finds Cukurs twenty years later in Brazil where he is hiding out after the Nuremberg trials where Germany is debating amnesty for those who committed crimes in the holocaust and have not yet been prosecuted.  Mossad decides they need to send a message that justice must be served and Cukurs is decided upon as the target.  The book at this point switches to fast paced spy novel with the mossad befriending him and luring him into a trap in Uruguay.  The book is very well written and is interspersed with stories from survivors and those that hunted Cukurs down showing where their lives ended up.  It is an emotional read and one that does an excellent job of shattering the myth that it was just a few bad eggs at the top of the German regime but the reality was that the day to day people participated as well.  It is a reminder for constant vigilance in protecting all classes, religions, gender, and the sanctity of human life against the worst humanity has to offer.",5,0,1906,0.056,1
875,"In her book Cities: The First 6,000 Years, archaeologist Monica L. Smith gives us the story of cities: how people built them and why, how ancient cities compare to modern cities, and how cities impact the people who live in them.  It is a fascinating look at the urban environments that so many of us take for granted, unquestioningly walking streets everyday without considering why or what went before.Smith's love of archaeology and discovery shine clearly off of each page- she seems as eager to share her discoveries with us as we are to read about them.  What I found most interesting was that Smith's views on the development of cities were such a seamless flow between the physical and the psychological.  She describes what a city needs: infrastructure of roads, water, food, planning, but also what a city does: it provides humans with exposure to people, ideas, and consumer goods that they would never see in a rural setting.  Much of the book examines how consumer habits are both created by the environment but also create the environment and the people's mindsets in turn.There is also the inevitable discussion of what comes next.  What about the collapse of cities?  Looking at the question from an archaeologist's point of view, Smith argues that perhaps this isn't as inevitable as we often think.  Cities may grow and change with the times, the environment, and the people in them, but historically very few simply end.  And even if a city ends (like Pompeii), its people may survive, move on, integrate and influence other cities.Although occasionally repetitive, Cities is a book full of fascinating information and new ways for people to look at the urban environments around them.  An excellent read for history lovers, those interested in archaeology, or even human psychology, as Smith makes the argument that all of those aspects go into what makes a city and how we should look at their history.",4,1,1923,0.106,1

Heidi and her Aunt Dete were heading up the mountain because her aunt would no longer be able to care for her and Grandfather would have to take over her responsibilities.  The village people were horrified because, in their eyes, there was something wrong with him.  The grandfather didn't quite know what to do with the precocious little girl who quickly made her bed in the hayloft. It was going to be a much different life for the old hermit.Soon Heidi was at home on the mountain.  She made friends with Peter, the goatherd, and Grandfather's two goats, Schwänli and Bärli.  It was as if she had always lived there.  Even Peter's blind grandmother noticed a difference in the grumpy old Grandfather and said to herself that ""he has changed since Heidi came.""  She had brought light and joy into all their lives.  The seasons past quickly and soon Heidi was seven.  Her Aunt Dete suddenly arrived back on the mountain because ""she had met a rich gentleman in Frankfort who was looking for a companion"" for his disabled daughter, Klara.  Heidi and the Grandfather had grown so close.  ""I won't go,"" but relented when her aunt lied to her.  How could they ever live without one another?This book is the perfect way to introduce a classic tale to the young child who, in time, will probably want to read the original story.  This condensed version of the book is very well done, but didn't have the tension that the Shirley Temple movie carried.

Quinn Ryan is left asking that question after she is dumped by Jamie Rudawaski, the only girl she’s ever loved.  This is made even more difficult by the fact that, before Quinn was in love with Jamie, she was her best friend.  Now it seems that Quinn doesn’t have any part of her life left that Jamie hasn’t touched, and she’s unsure how to cope.

This quickly-paced whodunit is well-plotted, with enough suspects, twists, and red herrings kept readers engaged and guessing until the reveal.Savannah Reid, a former detective turned private investigator, accompanied her husband, Detective Sergeant Dirk Coulter, on a stakeout at a drug house.  Savannah spots a woman, who is obviously under the influence of drugs or alcohol, exit her van and enter the home.  Savannah realizes there is a young child in the woman’s van and knows they must rescue him before the woman returns.  After they secure in their car, they learn CPS’s only option is to place the young child, whose name is Brody Greyson, in a group home, so the compassionate couple makes arrangements to provide him with temporary shelter in their San Carmelita, California home.  When a previous client, successful film star, and friend, Ethan Malloy, contacts Savannah that same night, she rushes to the address he provides.  Ethan hires Savanna to figure out who murdered his elderly friend, Lucinda Faraday, a silver-screen star from the late forties and early fifties.  Since Dirk is assigned to the investigation, Savannah and the members of the Moonlight Magnolia Detective Agency are busy helping him, Granny Reid steps in to help care for Brody.  The case is a difficult one, and the investigation is hampered by the fact that Lucinda was a serious hoarder.I voluntarily reviewed an Advance Reader Copy of this book.",5,0,1910,0.138,1
891,"What this book does masterfully well is show how the president-elect Abraham Lincoln shored up northern morale in preparation for the coming Civil War, while at the same time found his voice as our nation's 16th president.  This is a wonderfully informative book about Lincoln's train trip to the nation's capital, that reveals yet another facet for Lincoln admirers to appreciate. The writing is crisp and compelling, and the book's length--some 467 pages--hardly seems long at all, such is the author's gift for story-telling.The statistics of the Washington trip are mind-numbing: in 13 days, Lincoln traveled 1904 miles, through eight states, along 18 different railroad lines, and gave 101 speeches, some to as many as 10,000 people.At the beginning of each chapter, the author selects a short, appropriate passage from Homer's ""The Odyssey"".  Which seems fitting, as Lincoln's journey was fraught with danger (he received a number of death threats, and on several occasions was nearly crushed to death by the press of the crowd). It was an exhausting trip asl well, with overnight stops and speeches along the way, in Indianapolis, Cincinnati, Columbus, Cleveland, Pittsburgh, Buffalo, Albany, and New York City.  The author expertly summarizes a number of these speeches.  Perhaps the most telling was the one Lincoln gave at Philadelphia's Independence Hall on Washington's birthday, where he said, ""I have never had a feeling politically that did not spring from the sentiments embodied in the Declaration of Independence . . . that Declaration giving liberty, not alone to the people of this country, but hope to the world for all future time. . . .""  With the issue of slavery threatening civil war, the true meaning of the Declaration of Independence was being questioned openly; Lincoln made the issue of equality the centerpiece of his administration.The trip began in Lincoln's hometown of Springfield, Illinois, where, on February 12th, 1861 the president-elect, his family, political advisers, security guards, and members of the press, boarded The President's Special (a private train comprised of one baggage car, a passenger car, and a private car, for Lincoln and his family).  At the same time, the author contrasts Jefferson Davis's train trip to the Confederate capital in Montgomery, Alabama via the South's primitive, circuitous railroad network.Lincoln was loaded for bear, with a file of prepared speeches for each of the train stops, each meticulously labeled and placed in separate envelopes, including his inaugural address.  As it turned out many of the 100-plus speeches he delivered were ad-libbed off-the-cuff remarks delivered from hotel balconies and from the the platform of his train.While the South was gearing up for war, the north was in disarray under the hapless and corrupt leadership of outgoing president James Buchanan (since rated by historians as our nation's worst president).  How bad was the state of the North?  Democracy itself was under siege, says the author.  ""The lessons of history are hard to ignore. Every democracy ever known had failed, beginning with the Greeks twenty-four centuries earlier. They had succumbed one by one, to all the well-known vices of the people: corruption, greed, lust, ethnic hatred, distractibility, or simply a fatal indifference."" Regarding the state of the nation's leadership, the author says, ""As the Buchanan administration was sinking under the weight of its corruption, the public learned that it had awarded contracts for work on the Capitol to insider friends, who then outsourced the labor and pocketed the profits.""  The Buchanan administration also looked the other way while southern sympathizers raided federal armories of canons, guns and ammunition.Meanwhile, safely ensconced in Montgomery, Jefferson Davis issued a number of threats.  With Lincoln still en route to Washington, Davis made a speech in which he predicted that Northerners would soon ""feel Southern steel.""  Unfortunately for the south, writes the author, most of that Southern steel was made in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.Indeed, one of the stops on Lincoln's trip was in Pittsburgh, for the very reason that the steel city represented a source of industrial power that Davis and the Deep South could only dream about.  The author explains that a number of industrial and engineering advantages the North held over the South was mainly due the institution of slavery.  For example, a number of Germans who were the very engineers who designed the advanced northern railway infrastructure that Lincoln enjoyed while en route to Washington, was made possible because these German immigrants chose the free North over the slave-holding South because that's where the job opportunities were (by contrast, the South's railway system was haphazard and badly antiquated; a combination of mixed-gauge tracks and old technology, that greatly hindered the South's war effort, and would not be updated until late in the 19th century.Among the people Lincoln encountered on his 13-day journey was a Scottish immigrant, and captain of the steel industry, Dale Carnegie, who years later recalled: ""I never met a great man who so thoroughly made himself one with all men as Mr. Lincoln.""What was Lincoln's secret?  Quite simply, he trusted people and, in turn they trusted him.  According to historian and Lincoln biographer Benjamin Thomas, Lincoln had supreme faith in the people's right-mindedness, provided they could be made to understand, and he never questioned their powers of  comprehension when the facts were presented to them simply and honestly.That, in a nutshell is what Lincoln did on his 13 day journey through the North, is inform the people that equality was at the root of democracy, and would be the source of Northern strength in the coming cataclysm.Lincoln survived the threat of death and arrived safely in Washington, exhausted by the ordeal, but buoyed by his deeply-held belief in democracy.  Concludes the author:  ""By his words, and presence, he had shored up America's flagging belief in her institutions.  Millions of Americans had glimpsed a top hat parting a sea of humanity, or seen a bearded man wave from the back of a speeding train, or bow from a hotel balcony, and felt a connection to their government.  Most had never seen a president and never would again. . . .  Despite exhaustion, Lincoln had grown throughout the ordeal.  After a few missteps, his speeches became masterful, especially near the end, when he began to discover the mystical power that would lift his oratory to the heights he achieved at Gettysburg and the Second Inaugural.  No president has ever climbed to a higher altitude.  He restored a sense that America's words mean something.""",5,0,6754,0.095,0

894,"that’s parading around as religion...What this volume is supposed to be about is self-help, what makes you you, embrace the emotions, habits and mysteries that make you that way.  There’s some of that in here with a look at the brain, it’s biology and functions.  There’s a bunch of memoir and lots of one sided, religious opinion presented as science and history.  This isn’t the place for a chapter and verse rebuttal but authors like Ken Ham and Ravi Zacharias present this same information and give both sides (Christian/Athiest or Agnostic alongside acknowledged historical/scientific data).  Their approach allows readers to study and decide for themselves.I’m not being critical of Mike McHargue’s style,  (it’s conversational and welcoming), or his story, (it’s honest and effecting)but I do question if it was the best way to support the title.

897,"It’s rather uncanny how Greedy Heart could be placed in the current year of 2020 with the pandemic and economic upheaval going on right now – instead of back in 2006-2008 during another turning point in so many lives.Delia is not, at least of the beginning half of her story, a truly likable person.  Or at least, she wasn’t for me.  Her drive is to become totally filthy rich and the cost of that goal can be a bit high in the end.  Yet, she is also a compelling person to read about as we watch her slowly over this story change, grow into someone very different.  Life will do that to you so very often.  Greedy Heart is told in two very different timeframes – leading up to her move to NYC in 2006 and the life she leads to gain all the goals she had set for herself – and the aftermath of the market crash of 2008 when Delia comes across as a much wiser, softer woman who has been through extraordinary circumstances.  I can’t say that I ever truly “liked” Delia, but I did enjoy her story as she faces changes in her life and copes with becoming a very different woman with a much-adjusted outlook on life and money.Greedy Heart is filled with intensity, Wall Street shenanigans, intriguing people who come in and out of Delia’s life, and how she makes adjustments in attitude and actions.  A few laughs tossed in, a mystery, a bit of suspense, and a different look at how the crash of 2008 affected so many people in various ways.  I enjoyed this story even if I wasn’t totally in agreement with the main characters.  Still, it was so eerie how events can run parallel throughout history with a few twists and turns.*I received an e-ARC of this novel from Tule Publishing.

898,"Heiress for Hire starts a new series where three unconnected women receive generous legacies from a duke they never met.  It's Chase Radnor's job to find them and get the inheritances started. But Chase, as both a family member and an inquiry agent for the army and Home Office, wants to know who these women are, why they received inheritances, and if they could have murdered the old duke.  Because Chase believes his uncle was murdered- and much better the villain be a stranger than a family member!Minerva Heppelwhite has been struggling to survive for years- first with an abusive husband, and after his death, as a woman with little money.  The inheritance would allow her to live comfortably and to establish her dream: an investigation business.  And it makes sense to her that her first official investigation be into the possible murder of the man who left her the money to make it all possible.  She and Chase clash from the beginning- he doesn't want her investigating and thinks she might have done it, she has no intention of being blamed for something she didn't do.  Eventually they have to work together and grow closer as a result.Heiress for Hire is a bit odd because the theoretical point of the book- discovering a murderer- becomes secondary to the characters.  The end result is officially calling it an accident, and the reader is left to assume that the mystery will in fact be solved only by the end of the last book in the series.  But the character development and growth of both Chase and Minerva are satisfying to watch, and the extended Radnor family is both amusing and opportunistically awful enough to mean lots of fun encounters.  Not quite Knives Out in their reactions when they end up without the expected inheritances, but there are moments!I received an ARC of this book in exchange for an honest review",4,0,1844,0.101,0
899,"This book is a selection of David Carr's representative work throughout his career.  Some of the pieces are from Minneapolis and the rest are from New York (though there is a substantial amount of Washington commentary) Most of the political essays are dated and are mostly relevant for those who lived through the era and wanted to remind themselves on some of America's worst political moments.  While there are essays with respect to David Carr's appetites, I actually recommend his other book, The Night Of The Gun, for a more personal memoir of his highs and lowest lows.  Most of the celebrity and media essays are singularly excellent, and I actually wish that there was a collection of those alone as I know from his Minneapolis days that he really threw witty barbs at some of the sacrosanct institutions of the Minneapolis Star (before it was the Star-Tribune) and Pioneer Press.",5,0,889,0.086,1

901,"The story of the Galvin family was simultaneously heartbreaking and riveting.  Because it was not fiction, there was no neat, dramatic ending where all the loose ends were resolved and neatly tied together.  The book is full of victims—schizophrenic and those who weren’t.  I didn’t love the way it was written bouncing from family member to family member and back and forth in time, with medical/science discussion about schizophrenia interspersed throughout, but I recognize weaving a cohesive plot thread with this many characters would be problematic for any author.  The very technical nature of the medical/science discussion and analysis of schizophrenia, and specifically nature vs. nurture, caused the book to drag during those portions of the book.

I wish there were a few more title than they have in the catalog, but as far as I can tell, this is a newer endeavor.With this volume, I do lament the lack of vowelling in the Najdi Arabic.  I can speak a few Saudi dialects, so the consonant changes aren't too foreign for me, but it is hard to fully appreciate the meter, when only a few sukuns or fathahs are placed on words here and there.One more criticism would be the lack of a glossary as an appendix (at least for words that an advanced graduate would not necessarily know, or, in the case of more vulgar works, dialectical vocabulary which differs from Standard Arabic).Otherwise it is a beautiful series with an excellent introduction in titles I find quite interesting written by scholars whose work I respect.Great job!",4,0,898,0.163,1

In fact, it suddenly felt as if the second half had been written by a teenager who hadn't done any research.

I  had to talk myself into getting started.  The novel is beautifully written - a very comfortable writing style, and a rare novel written in the present tense.  Present tense gives the reader a sense of immediacy, you are there, it’s all happening as I am reading it.  It may not be everyone’s  favorite, but I am swept up by it.The locations are carefully detailed, both in England and in Pennsylvania.  And the characters, warts and all, are very real and easy to follow.  The male protagonists are both flawed - Stephen Doyle is an American, who is allied with the Irish group protesting British rule, in about the most savage manner possible.  James O’Connor is the Constable of Manchester, England, recently there to work toward peaceful coexistence  with the Irish protestors, and to begin a new life after the death of his wife.  Never the twain should meet, but they do.O’Connor’s drinking problem doesn’t help him in his job or friendships, but the arrival of a nephew from America, Michael Sullivan, gives him reason to pull himself together.The atmosphere in Manchester is volatile, and it is inevitable that Doyle and O’Connor will clash. O’Connor’s nephew, Michael, becomes a victim of this interaction - as Doyle kills Michael.The pages begin to turn very fast, as O’Connor has sworn revenge upon Doyle, who has disappeared.

He seems very appreciative of all the opportunities and relationships he's had, and comes off like the same nonchalant, go-with-the-flow guy he was on the mound.But that's all it really was ... just a recap, not much depth on anything.  200 pages in all with lots of divider pagers, doodles and interludes.  The lack of depth extended to subject matter as well.  About the only thing he had an opinion on was not liking pitching out of the bullpen.  He acknowledged his PED use but moved on pretty quickly.

There is fine line between burning them and the length of time cooking them to make them very brown (“like dark chocolate”).  For me this was an endeavor I would not repeat, as the onions did not stand out in any particular way and was just a long time stirring onions in the pot.  While the dish came out OK it definitely wasn’t amazing by any stretch, and the time it took to complete was very long.  The picture of the dish leaves a lot to be desired and overall I would not make this recipe again.  I then looked through the book for other recipes worth trying and nothing really stands out - maybe I’m just jaded from the first dish.  This book will end up in trash unfortunately.",2,2,920,0.1,1
915,"I bought this book for my 10-month old son because of the reaction it brought forth.  Although never been on a train before, my son bounced and swayed his body to the ""toot toot"" rhythm as if he was sitting on a train traveling along when he pressed the little button.  He could not stop giggling to the sound and the light that was coming out of the book!  I have never seen this much excitment with any other book he had!The button was easy for little hands to press (compared to a lot of other toys that are activated with press buttons).  My son had learnt how to press it after I showed him only once.Do bear in mind that the writing was short and simple without much of a storyline.  It was more for playing than for reading.  The sound and light also requires a lot of battery power.  I am waiting to see how long the 3 batteries will last.  Nonetheless, for the entertainment it provides, it is worthy of 5 starts!",5,0,922,0.077,0

917,"A great summer/beach/poolside read.  Or maybe it's a rainy afternoon and you just want a lovely, heartwarming story about two very different women.  Gray Howard is almost-divorced, driven and successful.  She's got her own internet business, tons of money, a son she adores, and a beautiful beach house in North Carolina.  She inadvertently gets Diana Harrington fired from her job at the local pharmacy.  Diana had a traumatic childhood that's affected her whole life.  Now she's broke, living in her car, and wondering how she will take care of herself yet again.Feels Like Falling is told from the dual POV of Gray and Diana during one magical summer in NC.  It's a mixture of sweetness, sadness, romance, motherhood, and it was the perfect escape.  For anyone who loves women's fiction, a Southern setting, good dialogue and interesting characters.  I will definitely look to read more of Kristy Woodson Harvey's books.",4,0,923,0.281,0

But after the first day, the winning chef is permanently eliminated by being murdered.  Angie gets involved while dealing with her restaurant, the contest, and her employees.  As friends and employees fall ill from heat stroke and poison, Angie is determined to figure this out.Lynn Cahoon writes three different series about strong women who find themselves embroiled in murder cases.

919,"This is what I kept wondering as I turned each page of this highly enjoyable and original novel by one of my favorite authors, Jacqueline Friedland.  That's Not a Thing is relatable and full of surprises.  It captures the essence of a young professional woman searching for love and meaning in New York City.  The story picks up speed as the main character, Meredith, gets more deeply entwined in an unusual love triangle.  She deals with various tragedies (serious ones) yet keeps her sense of humor and friendships intact.  For me, the focus is how Meredith is seemingly a master manipulator as she navigates her feelings for her two loves, only to discover in the end that she was never actually in control.  This is a great, easy read -- especially for fans of Jojo Moyes, modern romances set in New York City, and stories about what it's like to be a 20- and 30-something professional woman seeking clarity.",5,0,912,0.25,0

Maxwell provides challenging ideas that test your sincerity and expectations.Put Your Dream to the Test is filled with an abundance of intriguing thoughts and quotations.  Maxwell's main strength is that he comprises many of the traditional thoughts on dreams and vision and their empowering potential.  The material tends to be mildly repetitive at times, but the overall appeal of the book is very good.  The level of research Maxwell provided is very evident by the abundance of applicable references throughout the book.  The wealth of stories about great men and women give this book a motivating appeal.If you desire to be more than a dreamer and actually start achieving your dreams, Put Your Dream to the Test will provide you with a terrific acid test to help assure your dream, actions, and vision match reality.",4,0,949,0.289,0

This is well illustrated in his first assignment, to remove a troublesome privateer from preying on East India Company ships, (spoiler) which is accomplished not by a mighty sea duel but when when the enemy runs onto the coral reefs.  From there it is on to Macao and dealing with Chinese compradores, and then the key episode of the book, a brilliant land assault on a Dutch stronghold concocted in company with the famous Stamford Raffles.Apart from the aforementioned adventures, there is a fascinating introduction to the relationship between Crown and Company in the East, the divisions that existed within the latter (civil and military), and the onshore life of a senior British naval figure in that part of the world.",5,0,945,0.131,0

923,"Once in awhile a truly spectacular novel comes along.  Being in a position to read lots of new authors can be very satisfying but you sometimes have to read several klinkers before you stumble upon a truly great read.  ""The Caretakers"" is one of those unusual surprises that makes it worthwhile to continue to explore new novelists.The First Law of Physics states ""an object in motion tends to stay in motion"".  In this case a documentary film ends up exonerating a man accused of a savage crime and who is then set free after serving 17 years in prison.  This main plot line then splits into an octopus of subplots that sprint off on their own only to be slowly integrated into a fascinating denouement that ties everything together with brilliant strokes.Don't be alarmed if this story takes a while to get rolling.  There are lots of details concerning the history of the main characters and the environments that they inhabit.  The author tends to get a bit wordy initially but there is a reason for that.  The plot, subplots and the characters are all 'complicated'.  Things aren't always what they seem at first blush and you'll occasionally get that annoying little tickle when something 'just doesn't seem right'.  Trust your instincts on this one but don't go all in until the story starts to sort itself out.  You'll get all your answers at the end of this novel.Did I call this book amazing?  Brilliant?  Thought provoking? Or magnificent and awesome?  It is all those and more.  I am extremely impressed with Eliza Maxwell's scary but ultimately sad and satisfying story.  This is an incredible work that should be read by anyone interested in the mystery genre.

After following @thisgatherednest in all of the places for several years I was so excited to hear she was writing her first book.  Their journey through embryo adoption is what drew me to following their family, but I think there is something most anyone can relate to in her story.  She tackles some really difficult topics with the mantra of “hard isn’t always bad”.  Her writing style and storytelling makes this book hard to put down.  I laughed, cried, and just so thoroughly enjoyed reading her perspective.  Life isn’t always going to turn out how you planned, but if you let the journey teach you along the way you’ll find a strength and bravery you didn’t know you possessed.

925,"Having just finished reading this book, I must admit that at times I felt like the authur was way too hard on husbands and blamed them for all the problems in marriage.  Surely wifes desire some blame in difficult marriages!  Yet, the more I read and opened up, the more I felt his assessment is fair given our God given responsibilities as the head of the home.  But, be warned; the lessons in this book will only work if you are committed to living a Christian lifestye.  Although there are many type-o's throughout the book and it is a bit rambling at times, as my pastor says, ""you need to eat the hay and leave the sticks"".  If you are able to be objective and set a side your natural defensiveness as a man, you will find many useful lessons in this book.

This one falls into the meh category for me.Now, I am a huge fan of one of her books, 'Big Girls Don't Cry.'  I recommend it as a book full of what I liked to call 'soapy goodness.'The premise of this book, finding out that you are related to strangers because of a 23 and Me DNA test done on a lark, attracted me because it held all of the 'soapy goodness' potential.Alas, this book did not live up to my expectations.  It was the opposite of soapy goodness.  It was pretty dreary with the three women each going through some really deep relationship angst that had nothing to do with the DNA test.  A big swath of the start of the book is rather dry and talky.  Also the perspective cuts between the three POVs of the three sisters were a little jarring.I ended up skim reading just to get to the end.",2,0,896,0.128,0
927,"I finished Alan Levinowitz's book a few days ago and wanted to write a review that does it justice.  There is so much to process and appreciate though, that it's hard to know, where to start.Having read and enjoyed ""The Gluten Myth"" a few years ago, I went into this book with similar expectations.  I thought it would be another round of debunking pre-scientific ideas of what's ""natural"" and what isn't, how people get it wrong, the damage such misconceptions do, etc.  Boy, was I wrong!  And yet, I've never been so glad to be so wrong.  Alan actually put together one of the most nuanced , thoughtful, and considered books that I've ever read, and I've read a lot!Before the end of the 1st chapter, I DM'd Alan on Twitter, thanking him for HOW he wrote the book.  He did so, in a way that appealed to both my skeptical, atheistic, science-oriented background AND my Zen Buddhist, emotional, kind of mystical leanings.  I long struggled to reconcile those different aspects of my life, but eventually I gave up.  I simply accepted them as a paradox.  When Alan replied, ""As for the paradox? That's the theme of the epilogue,"" I was thrilled.  When I finally read the epilogue - it was scientifically and emotionally beautiful.I've long appreciated Alan's perspective on scientific endeavors.  As a Professor of Ancient Religions with an interest in understanding the intersection of humans and science, he sees both the conflicts & overlaps.  After all, humans only developed and began practicing the scientific method in the last few hundred years.  For most of human history, discoveries were hit or miss, often accidental, and the causes were usually attributed to some divine force or being.Besides the elegant beauty of his writing, what I found most remarkable, was the sheer breadth and scope of Alan's analysis.  He spoke of the human spirit's longing for, and almost mystical attraction to, the raw beauty of nature, interweaving it with economics, environmental preservation, colonization of the New World and the clash of civilizations, theology, and more.While I could go on, I hope to leave any readers of this review with more questions than answers. The kind of questions that Alan addresses, without trying to prescribe definitive answers.  When I finished, my personal paradox (described above) was no closer to resolution than at the beginning.  And yet, it was a profoundly satisfying conclusion, in that both sides of the paradox felt heard and valued.I've read dozens of books about science, science communication, theology, etc over the last 30 years.  Not a single one was quite like this.  I didn't just enjoy the book - I'm profoundly grateful to Alan, for having written it.",5,0,2703,0.146,1

Alan Turing did great work for England, and in return was not recognized until many years after his life.Alan Turing's story is a difficult one, so I wondered how they would approach it for children.

Make no mistake:  he approaches his books from a Christian world view that I also hold dear.  But what I love about this book is how he integrates real-world respected scientific views (from Daniel Kahneman, Jonathon Haidt, and others) to support his points, and does so with a conversational appeal that does not feel 'textbook'.Bottom line:  the bible real has been right about our nature all along, and social scientists keep re-discovering that.  Brant illustrates our cognitive biases and self-centered focus via real-life examples filled with love, transparency, passion, and truth.

931,"Ouch!  Ouch! Ouch!  That’s the sound of my toes being stepped on by Nick Spalding in his book “Logging Off”.  The basic premise of the story is about a 30 something man named Andy who is suffering from a number of physical ailments.  Andy visits his doctor to find out what is wrong with him (believing he has a very serious terminal illness based on his internet research) and is surprised to find out that there is nothing wrong with him and that his various ailments are being caused by his extreme addiction to the internet world.  I know, how could that possibly be true?  I didn’t believe it anymore than Andy did.  The doctor recommends that Andy go on a 60-day digital detox and the remainder of the book is the story of Andy’s journey through the next 60 days.  He suffers a lot of digital withdrawal, remorse for committing to such a foolish idea and misadventures caused by not having access to such digital tools as GPS and restaurant ratings.  But along the way, Andy also finds a lot of positives that he had been missing out on when he had his nose buried in his phone or his tablet.  Now to explain the “stepping on my toes” comment at the beginning of this review.  I’m an older woman who did not grow up with digital technology so came late to the internet game.  But I embraced the digital life with gusto.  Ok, I’m not nearly as bad as Andy was when we first meet him in the book (or at least I don’t think I am) but it made me have some second thoughts about whether I was becoming too dependent on my iPhone, iPad and laptop to the exclusion of actually living my life.

What I appreciate about Shelby Law Ruttan’s The One Pot Paleo Cookbook is she makes it really simple to start.A quick personal intro, a non-overwhelming overview of the theory behind Paleo, a few lists and away you go into the recipes.  The recipes are sub categorized into Gluten Free, Nut Free, Dairy Free... and I like that there is a little graphic of what kind of “one pot” (baking sheet, slow cooker, pan...) you are using.

If you are writing a book it is your platform and certainly you should communicate whatever philosophies you want; that said, I think the author does a fair job of not beating one over the head with the obvious stance taken on climate change, et al.  This book is somewhat autobiographical in nature as the author takes you through her travels and learning and discovery and her own fascination.  In the early chapters I thought it was going to be a bit dry like the Southwestern desert she spends some time in; but that was not the case.

The topic, however, intrigued me.  I'm so happy I took the chance . . . and even more grateful that I won the giveaway.  This book is AMAZING!.The language is easy to follow, and no matter how complex the subject, the approach Mr Elkington takes allows the reader to fully understand the points and nuances of his call for us to ""be grit in the corporate oyster."" He masterfully sets up a concept, talks to the current way of thinking, and then identifies the needed way of thinking before following with examples that make the concept and logic easy to understand.  For example, Mr Elkington frequently talks to change starting slowly, and then arriving with a bang of super-consequences.  One such change is the introduction of plastics.  Where plastics were once an answer to a problem, they now represent a problem of far reaching consequences.  To make the point, he identifies the environmental impact of plastics polluting our oceans - a super wicked problem which cannot be simply answered and where answers each have further consequences.I'm particularly drawn to the potential implications for both business and Government in facing our current environment as well as the future.  We need to look for the slow shifts and get on board early if we want to stay at the forefront of building a future proactively, vice living in a future not of our making.I can easily see this book used in education environments as well as board room material.

945,"5 ""Transcendent"" Stars!Where the Lost Wander spoke to my heart in so many ways.  As a woman, I could easily identify with Naomi May.  To follow her path along the wagon train and witness her celebrations along with the many hardships and losses was a gift.  I also empathized with John Lowry, a man between two worlds.  He was a man of such strong character and caring.  You knew these two deserved to be together, but the hurdles they had to overcome were often so overwhelming.  They were difficult times and nothing came easy.""Help me find my way home, wherever home is.""Ms. Harmon has proven time and again that she is a talented author in several genres.  That said, I have to say that I have really loved her recent historical fictions, including this one.  They are simply breathtaking to me.  She paints a picture of the time period in such a way that I can easily envision it.  Then, descriptions of the characters follow and I am pulled into their stories and feel as if I've known them forever.  I simply sit in awe of her ability to write such different stories and do it so very flawlessly and with such beauty.Where the Lost Wander really does make you feel the struggle that was present on both sides during the time period.  You saw how easy it was for misunderstandings to occur and lead to extreme bloodshed.  My heart broke many times at how cautious the Indians were forced to be in order to not upset the cavalry.  Likewise, it was such a fine line between the factions in different tribes to keep the peace so that anger at the actions of a few didn't reign down on all of them.""Hating never fixed anything.""I can't recommend this book enough.  It will definitely be one of my favorites for the year.Thank you to NetGalley and Lake Union Publishing for this ARC in exchange for an honest review.",5,0,1817,0.154,0
946,"There's a lot of hate towards the author regarding this third book in a series.  It appears everyone's upset with his political slant in this story.  Well, I looked completely past that and concentrated on just the story.  Sure, politics plays a big part, but I didn't let it bother me.  In fact, the political aspect helped the story (just my opinion).  I really enjoyed the first 2 books in this series and looked forward to this one.  For me, this one did not disappoint.  There was a short sequence of events where it was a little slow, but once the MC figures out what is happening, the story really moves.  And let's not forget the comedy.  Sure, it's 95% serious, but some of his lines are hilarious.Yes, it's politically slanted, but look past that and I think you will really enjoy this story.  I'm looking forward to his next ""Straker"" story in this series!",5,0,867,0.151,1
947,"Bonnie Tsui loves to swim, and her book is a big-hearted embrace of humans in water.  Ranging from the pool to  open ocean, she hunts down and interviews famous or unusual members of the swimming fraternity.  Some topics of interest include: the benefits of cold water swimming - cold as in knocking out  ice miles  in Arctic waters; the centuries old Japanese practice of samurai swimming; the psychology of long distance ocean swimmers.  This is interspersed with accounts of Tsui’s own experiences as a competitive swimmer, an ocean swimmer and someone who’s forged stronger family ties by sharing time in the water.She also describes the mental states and benefits of swimming, where you can be both locked into the present moment and slip outside of standard clock time.  An enjoyable, informative read for those who swim and those want to know more about the enduring human impulse to return to the substance from whence we sprang.",4,0,937,0.151,1
948,"I have followed the keto diet for almost two years now, after decades of creeping weight gain despite restricted calories, a strict diet with no sugar or alcohol, exhaustive exercise, depression, melanoma, fertility and thyroid issues . . . and Doctor shaming. After a young doctor told me ""everyone lies"" and that she didn't believe I was really doing what I said and suggested medication or surgery, I switched to Keto. OK, after a day of bawling I switched to Keto. As if a miracle, my weight started to drop off, my health improved, my diet was more varied and enjoyable and I have never looked back except to shake my head at the years I've wasted.This book has a thick matte paperback cover with standard thickness pages and a nice binding.  The font they chose is clear and the type size is such that it is easy to read without feeling like they are trying to fill page space.The first part of the book explains keto and intermittent fasting.  All the basic subjects are covered -- dispelling myths, macros and benefits, as well as more advanced topics like carb cycling.  The next chapter covers the benefits and possible negative effects of fasting and keto, tips to succeed, and how to stock your kitchen.  The third chapter is the meal plan.  Personally I don't care for meal plans, I never want to eat what is offered on the day they expect, but I know that some people do like them and it can simplify getting started if you eat what you're told.  This entire information section of the book is 43 pages long.  This book avoids a common mistake diet specific books make -- data overload.  I think that most people who buy a diet specific book already have a pretty good idea about that diet given the amount of information that is available on the internet.  Many books follow unnecessary bunny trails, feel like they're trying to impress the reader with how much they know, or how complicated it could be, which is just annoying and condescending.  I didn't get that impression with this book.  The information included was both relevant and helpful to the new person starting keto and fasting.  There was nothing off the wall or loony, just basic and straightforward.  I found that refreshing.  I would have liked this section to be a bit shorter, but if you removed the meal planning pages it wasn't outrageous.The recipes start on page 47 and go through page 166.  Most of the ingredients were easily found locally and not outrageously expensive.  The recipes were mostly simple to follow and resulted in tasty meals.  Some of my tried and true favorites were in there, (hello crustless quiche!) as well as some new ones (bacon onion jam!)  Each recipe has the nutritional values listed, but the typical warnings are valid here -- make sure you watch the portion size or it will be easy to blow your carb limits out of the water.  I also question some of the figures given -- sometimes the total carbs, fiber, etc didn't match up with the individual ingredients, resulting in a carb count that seemed too low.This book also avoids a second pet peeve of mine.  Often cookbooks are half filled with pictures of delightful food, but food that my creations will never look like.  I find it annoying, I would rather have an extra recipe than a full page picture.  This book does have a full page photo between each chapter, but otherwise has limited the extra pics.  I appreciate it!I wish when I started I had a book similar to this one.  I don't keep many cookbooks I review but this one will have a spot on my shelf!",4,0,3531,0.129,1
949,"I have always enjoyed John C. Maxwell's books on leadership and personal development, as they are practical to the nth degree.  Put Your Dream to the Test: 10 Questions that Will Help You See It and Seize It is no different, and I'm using it to guide a dream that I want to realize.  It's a perfect framework for attaching the personal commitment to the nuts and bolts of doing the work necessary to make the dream happen.Contents:Introduction: What Is Your Dream?; The Dream TestThe Ownership Question: Is My Dream Really My Dream?The Clarity Question: Do I Clearly See My Dream?The Reality Question: Am I Depending on Factors within My Control to Achieve My Dream?The Passion Question: Does my Dream Compel Me to Follow It?The Pathway Question: Do I Have A Strategy to Reach My Dream?The People Question: Have I Included the People I Need to Realize My Dream?The Cost Question: Am I Willing to Pay the Price for My Dream?The Tenacity Question: Am I Moving Closer to My Dream?The Fulfillment Question: Does Working toward My Dream Bring Satisfaction?The Significance Question: Does My Dream Benefit Others?Conclusion: Looking Back... Looking Forward; NotesToo many dreams are really nothing more than daydreams or pie-in-the-sky dreams, things that will never go beyond the confines of the dreamer's skull.  Maxwell lays out a series of questions that can, if honestly answered, can separate daydreams from potential life-changing dreams.  If your dream survives all ten of the questions listed above, then you know you have something that can make a huge difference in your life.And Maxwell's material isn't just ethereal touchy-feely stuff.  In the Clarity Question, he relates the story of Michael Hyatt, the current CEO of Thomas Nelson Publishers.  When Hyatt took over the publisher role at Thomas Nelson, he inherited a division that was in more trouble than he knew.  It would have been easy to just fold things up and focus the company's resources on areas doing much better.  Instead, he stepped away from the situation and came up with a vision for what Thomas Nelson would become.  Not necessarily *how* to make it happen, just what the end state would be.  By clarifying that vision, he was able to enlist others to commit to the dream, as well as coming up with ideas on how best to get there.  The outcome far exceeded the vision, but it was because he had done more than just daydream about the possibilities.  He made it a clear vision in his mind that could have an actual outcome.I have some health and fitness goals that are becoming critical in my life.  The appearance of this book in my life at this particular time is more than just coincidence.  I already feel more confident and focused with Maxwell's insights.  Good stuff here...",5,0,2758,0.162,1
950,"4.25-4.5 STARSWith her latest novel, “Little Secrets,” author Jennifer Hillier delivers a multi-layered story spun from an intricate web of lies, secrets and betrayal.  Right from the get-go, this story’s compelling premise pulled me in and held me captive right up until the very end.The main characters—Marin & Derek--are understandably flawed, as they struggle to navigate each day following the tragic disappearance of their 4 year old son.  Together, yet alone, grief weighs heavy on them both, causing their once happy marriage to now reside on rocky ground.Through a series of twists and turns, the mystery turns from intriguing to riveting, as the truth slowly unfolds, leading up to a shocking reveal.  It’s a roller-coaster ride of emotions, to be sure.  If it weren’t for a certain secondary character that I found annoying and immediately took a dislike to, this book would garner a perfect 5 star rating, rather than falling just a tad bit short.",4,0,959,0.115,0
951,"I am a lover of audiobook memoirs read by their author, but I'm not someone who is generally very interested in for military stories.  I'm more of a Kitchen Confidential kind of person.  But I'm a dog person.  And I live with chronic migraine.  Most people will never have an understanding of how debilitating migraine can be, let alone how hard it is to find a good neurologist.  When I read that author Will Chesney suffered a traumatic brain injury that left him living with chronic migraine, and that his military working dog Cairo helped him pull through, I was very interested in hearing him tell his story.  I finished the audiobook in two days - I just couldn't put it down.  Chesney narrates a wonderful memoir that is in many ways a coming of age story, a devoted dog story, and an overcoming-a-diagnosis story.  At its core, it's as human a story as they come.",5,0,871,0.135,1
952,I liked this book.But it was really weird with typos like lbramblestar in the allegiances and random dashes.I thought the imposter was Darktail at first.I dont think it's Ashfur because Ashfur was alive when it all happened.I also think it seems odd because Squirrelflight stalls until November 10th to say the imposters name.I also liked that Shadowsight lived after lbramblestars attack.I bought this book on Kindle (like I did with all other Warriors books) so I don't need to worry about the condition.I felt sad when the rebels (exiled cats) said Bristlefrost couldn't be trusted because I really think Bristlefrost would be the one to betray the imposter because she's deputy and one of the only cats Bramblestar trusts.I know other people say the imposter's Ashfur but Ashfur would have to have two spirits.SPOILERS STOP HEREI really recomend this book because then 1: you can read the other part of my review and 2: you can have your own opinion on the book.,5,0,966,0.053,0
953,"4 1/2 Stars...Ty and Kaylee's love story was a special one.  They are both bearing deep scars from their pasts.  Ty lost his ability to continue his career as a bull rider after he was severely injured in an auto accident.  Kaylee was trying to recover from the death of her fiancee.  Even though they are both drawn to one another, Ty doesn't think he's capable of a long-term relationship and Kaylee can't risk having her heart broken again by someone who isn't the right match for her.  She is too fragile.I simply love this series.  Both of the books have been wonderful with characters that you can become easily connected to.

954,"This book was great!  The author convincingly makes the case that globalization existed well before European explorers like Christopher Columbus came onto the scene, and describes how interactions between societies across the globe resulted in innovation and market pressures that seem very similar to the issues we see today.  In addition to giving the reader a LOT of interesting historical facts (The Chinese sailed to Africa!  Switching to Islam allowed people to avoid taxes!), it manages to cover a huge range of people, places, and events in a concise and interesting way.  Although it wasn't a huge part of the book, I also appreciated the insights into past and ongoing academic debates, and the explanation of how various pieces of evidence support the current accepted theories.  Would definitely recommend for anyone looking to learn more about global history!",5,0,872,0.253,0
955,"WOW!  Highly recommend.  This book is so full of great information it will require a re-read in the future.  Evy has a starred career of bravery and loyalty from her Secret Service career and with it some good stories to tell.  I really appreciated that she pulled out character qualities of Presidents and First Ladies she has spent time with in more than one administration in a non-partisan way - celebrating what made these people great during their tenure in charge.  So Evy gets very practical in ways to make sure your home is safe, ways to make sure you are vigilant and the safest you can be when out and about, but there is also great information on how to read people, to interpret body language, to ask good questions and know when you are being lied to.

Her chapter on connection hit me hard.  Reading it during the strange stillness and isolation of the COVID-19 quarantine, her words resonated with me, and her truth about who I am and what I need, filled me up.Here is a quote, “If all I was left holding were relationships with my family and closest community, if that is all that remained, I would still consider myself the luckiest girl on earth.  My life derives it’s greatest meaning, it’s power and energy, from the people I love who love me too.”  I can’t wait to listen to the audiobook (read by JH herself).

957,"I had a hard time enjoying this final novel.  I love The Legacy of Heorot, re-read it every couple of years.  Less so for Beowulf's Children as it is a much more painful, emotionally intense story.  Starborn & Godsons seems disjointed.  (SPOILER ALERT) I loved the greater insights into the Chthulu, especially their relation ship to Terrestrial cetaceans.I would have like more background on the Godsons and their relations on Earth.  I suspect (w/o direct quotable proof) they may be related to events in Saturn's Race & Achille's Choice (possibly same universe as Building Harlequin's Moon).  It is interesting that no mention was made by the Godson's about the expedition that colonized the planet in Destiny's Road.If you are a die hard Niven fan, or Niven & Pournelle,  this is probably still a MUST BUY, like it was for me.

960,"Series Info/Source: I got an eGalley of this book to review through NetGalley.  This is the second book in the Founders Trilogy.Story (5/5): The book starts out with Sancia and the other Foundryside crew working on a heist to steal important magic from one of the main Houses.  This was fun and very much fit with the Ocean’s 11 like feel of the first book.  Then things quickly get more dire as Sancia finds out that Crasedes Magus (an evil hierophant) is about to be reborn.  Sancia is in the unique position to help stop his rebirth and rushes to do  so.The story was very well done and ended at a good spot.  There was never a dull moment here, despite the long length of the book. I really loved it and it was incredibly engaging.Characters (5/5): All of the characters in this book have a lot of depth and are very well thought out.  They are all quirky and have somewhat of an anti-hero feel to them.  I continue to be impressed with how much I love these characters and how complex they are.Setting (5/5):  I love the city of Tevanne and love the scriving magic that makes this city thrive.  This is such a rich and well built world and I enjoy every second reading about.Writing Style (5/5):  The book is very well written, well paced, and just very well balanced.  There is some neat magic, lots of action, intriguing politics, and wonderful characters.  The whole thing makes for a very well packaged story that is unique and highly engaging.  I am a huge fan of Bennett’s writing.My Summary (5/5): Overall I really don’t have anything bad to say about this book.  It’s a well done total package with a great story, great characters, a unique world and wonderful writing.  I highly recommend this book if you are looking for an entertaining epic fantasy that is approachable and just pure fun to read.",5,0,1812,0.259,0
961,"There was no doubt in my mind that I had to grab up this anthology and not just because one of the novellas was from a favorite series.  I love trying new to me authors particularly in these genres and it was no hardship since I've seen glowing, enthusiastic reviews from fellow booklovers.  Fantastic Hope took me on a journey through riveting, engaging, and often emotional stories from this world and beyond.Twilight Falls by Jonathan MaberryJoe Ledger Rogue Team International AdventureA crack black ops team are up against bio terrorists who have already hit several locations.  A source sends them into the heart of Africa on a mission to save the world.Loved the craggy and lethal lead character and the taunt action.5 starsNot in This Lifetime by Sharon ShinnA reincarnation story about a woman who meets familiar faces down through time- including the man who always kills her right when she makes close friends and finds something else.  She's tried everything to change fate, will this time be any different?Simple, but poignant.  Nice finish with that twist.4 starsMr. Positive, the Eternal Optimist by Larry CorreiaA sci-fi that is hilarious when an average guy encounters what he thinks is a mugging and turns into a bizarre series of attempts to shoot him and not kill him.  And, the 'mugger' might not even be human.Big points for the fun way of telling a curious sci-fi.5 starsNo Greater Love by Kacey EzellA historical paranormal that focuses on a young Mormon pioneer girl who makes the decision to stay behind with her father's second wife having a baby to help her while the rest of their group including her family goes on.  Her sacrifice introduces her to the Loup Garou and she continues to sacrifice herself for love of others.Emotional and sweetly tugging at my heart.4 starsBroken Son by Griffin BarberFuturistic sci-fi that follows a crime boss serving his sentence on a space mine.  His money and his ingenuity get him privileges.  A mysterious scientist arrives to study an anomaly, but not after one of the 'broken' starts spouting gibberish that jibes with the scientist's study.Strong, wry narration voice and engaging character4.5 starsHeart of Clay by Kevin J. AndersonDay Shamble, Zombie PI AdventureShamble a zombie PI and his human cop best friend, McGoo, come across the murder of gollems who work at an unnatural Renaissance Faire while Shamble is taking his ghost girlfriend and vampire daughter to the fair.This unnatural world sounds fun and I'm definitely hunting out the series.4 starsReprise by John G. HartnessQuincy Harker, Demon Hunter AdventureA walk through Central Park has Quincy Harker blinking at the sight of a group of hooded figures attempting to call up a demon.  He magically sabotaged this, but then his attention is caught by the face of one he thought tragically killed.  This dredges up painful memories, but also makes him determined to intervene in the cabal who are not deterred in summoning the demon.This sequel variation on the old Dracula story and all new adventures for a magic-wielding hero caught my attention and I want more.4.5 starsAsil and the Not Date by Patricia BriggsAlpha and Omega StoryAsil is an old werewolf who's sanity is on shaky ground.  His friends decide to help him.  He is challenged to participate in five anonymous dates all through different dating agencies.  His latest is through a non-dating agency and he meets her at a restaurant.

And a quiet, determined man can accomplish much.At first I was unsure where and when the story was taking place, but I loved experiencing it moving through the years and fleshing all that out.  Winn and Jenny are engaging characters.5 starsFallen by L.E. Modesitt, Jr.A traveler enters time at crucial moments and attempts to complete his quest, but is always thwarted by the opposition.  They battle over such profound human tenets as faith, knowledge, and choice though the actual battle is over libraries (knowledge) of books.  There is another scene taking place elsewhere with two great powers battling for control of something mysterious.In the end, it all makes sense what it was about and ringing with the author's call to the reader.  An allegorical sci fi perhaps?4 starsWorking Conditions by Patrick M. TracyA young man newly changed as a vampire pleads to keep his job at the convenience store- this bit of normalcy when everything else in his life is upended.  The convenience store owner has a choice to make and receives a surprising gift.It was more of a snapshot or vignette than finished story, but it was poignant and engaging.  It also described vampirism in a visceral way that left me wanting more from this world.4 stars.Last Contact by MC SummerWhen Dr. Fetherstonhaugh (Fanshaw), wakes up one crisp February morning in St. Louis, all the world is glued to whatever newstreaming device they have because an alien ship is now hovering over Milwaukee.  His day only gets weirder when he's picked up from his university and taken to a different location.A story with classical sci-fi overtones that had me curious and thoughtful by the end.4 stars.Ronin by William McCaskeyA teddy bear hero slays nightmare monsters in a little girl's dream world and is her stuffed companion by day.

They are dangerous and bred for war, but they are her children that she brought into being.  She just can't destroy them all so she runs with one nearly adult Donai and two precious cargo boxes donai eggs.

HamilitonAnita Blake, Vampire HunterA couple in anguish accuse Anita of getting their daughter pregnant- okay, not personally, but one of her raised zombies.  Impossible, she thinks.  But, as curious as the issue is, that daughter is now losing her life as it is drained in a connection to a zombie that shouldn't exist.  Anita, her cop and shifter partners must chase the issue to the source before it's too late.My first go at the series.  It was exciting, creative, and a world that I wouldn't mind visiting again.4.5 starsI experienced Fantastic Hope in the audio edition with Kimberly Alexis and Holter Graham taking turns doing the narration work.  It was my first time listening to either so I was suitably impressed by their combined talent.  Both had flexible voices that could do a large colorful cast of characters, situations, tone, and pace so well.  They also impressed me with how they had such a repertoire that this collection of stories didn't get confusing or struggle with the same voice sound.  Just amazing work.All in all this was a sensational collection of sixteen sci-fi and urban fantasy stories.  They ran the gamut of settings, tone, emotions, and pace.  It was an incredible variety and some clever plots and creative work with strong development.  I either really liked or absolutely loved all of them.  I'll be going back for many of the author's backlist works.  Highly Recommend to sci-fi and urban fantasy fans!",5,0,8309,0.176,0

Whenever there is a lot of money at stake, there is corruption.  You have to say what they want you to say and keep certain types of discoveries to yourself.  The medical field is extremely corrupt.  She had her work stolen, she was jailed without cause, harassed, hassled, etc. for her discoveries.I have known people in the medical research field who had the same things happen to them because their research challenged what pharma and educational institutions wanted them to say.  Others I know had their work stolen and/or misrepresented, so her experience is the same as others who were silenced.This is a sad commentary on our medical system, but it rings true.Notice the negative commenters never even bought the book.

The hunt for the perpetrator is complicated by all the stuff - all the memorabilia, clothes, papers, stuff- in her house.  Granny Reid helps, Dirk is patient, and Savannah is her usual amusing self.  One of the nice things about this series is the family aspect and the humor, which never gets too broad.  Thanks to Netgalley for the ARC.  A romp.",5,0,883,0.099,1

They are selfless, committed, caring and dedicated individuals to a person.

Asher is the sweetest and most perfect boy and friend, Sidney just isn't good enough for him in my opinion.  I think my favorite part was how well Pennington wrote the characters.

All Joanna's recipes are so simplistic, from the peanut butter sandwich with grape seed paste to the Chef Boyardee ravioli bites, all the recipes are so easy my kindergartner has mastered them all in just 3 days after her nap time!  Joanna's grand finale is a Cool Whip cream pie with a store bought graham cracker crust, topped with an unthawed bag of sliced strawberries!  Yum Yum!

I’ve recommended it to scores of friends, and to complete strangers in bookstores around the world.  With delight, I can now add ""Simon the Fiddler"" to that same list.Jiles has a unique ability to write about a place and time so that they backlight her luminous characters.  The beautiful arc of Simon’s  storyline follows the travels of a small band of musicians who are thrown together in the waning days of the civil war in Texas.  The friendship between the men as they rely on each other for love and support made me want to have them in my life.

I love stories that have strong character development and this one fit -- Evan and Diana are not perfect but were both people I enjoyed rooting for.  The Regency romance isn’t my usual genre and after I read the book I enjoyed doing some research (okay, Google and Wikipedia) to learn more about the era, what a Prince Regent really is and Prinny in particular, and discovering that Almack’s was a real place.  I wish the inheritance hadn’t been quite as large because it’s just too easy to pull things off when your budget is unlimited and I think that Even and Diana have enough gumption they could have found a way through even if it was more challenging.  I’m planning to send this one to my sister and am looking forward to the next book in the series and have a feeling that we’ll both love it too.",4,0,882,0.229,0

While reading the story, all I could hear is a wealthy rich Jewish girl who got everything she wanted except the boy.  Boo hoo.First, I didn't know it was a romantic book (gag).  While I liked the story because I lived in that era and know the times were so much more rigid (stick to your own kind!!!) then now, she bothered me that she was so wrapped up in herself and winning a dumb beauty contest.  THAT bugged me.And I didn't like that the author wrapped it up like she did.  Oy vey.  I stopped reading the story as soon as that happened and fast forwarded to the end.

Part 2 gave the story a new light and I found myself unable to put the book down.  I wanted to figure out the mystery of the Beetle SO badly!  What a great read it was.  My only complaint is the ending...it seemed to end so abruptly and I would have liked to see some kind of battle or confrontation of the men and the Beetle.

977,"I have read almost all of Clare Walker Leslie's books on nature journaling and naturalist education since the early 1980s.  Each one has been truly wonderful and I have learned so much from her!  This most recent book of hers feels like a personal expression of all she has experienced and taught in her previous books.  She shares her own hand written and drawn nature journals, day by day, month by month,  for a full year.  I am savoring each page I read, and I keep putting off reading the last page because I don't want it to end!  Her drawing/watercolors are exquisitely expressive and I sometimes just page through the book for the lift I feel from looking at them.  Her writing includes snippets from her personal life, observations from her time spent in nature, scientific information from her explorations of nature, comments about the news of that particular day,, her love and concern for the environment, her favorite quotes and the deeper questions of life on this planet, which we all have, particularly as we grow older.Every entry tugs at my heartstrings as Clare seamlessly weaves all this together, sometimes through her drawing, sometimes through her writing.  She gives us glimpses into the joy she experiences sharing nature with her grandchildren and practical ideas she teaches them to explore nature with her.  I also found many ideas to help me to grow and deepen my own reflection and connection with nature.  I feel inspired to incorporate these to make my journal more meaningful and to help me live my life in the presence of nature. Clare's journal pages are fun, intriguing, and comforting.  I frequently felt I was receiving a big hug from Mother Nature herself.  This book has become one of my all-time forever books - a book I will treasure and read forever!",5,0,1794,0.163,0

How to have my voice and never be intimated or coerced into saying something just to please someone else is a great feeling.  To speak without fear of incrimination, but with facts and clarity is very liberating.  That comes across clearly in ""Don't Burn This Book"".  I thank the author for sharing his personal opinions, personal life experiences, and his insistence that we are true to ourselves.  Freedom of speech and thought is something I don't wish to lose.

When the chance arose for me to receive an advance copy of this book in exchange for an honest review, I jumped on it.  I've waited a year and a half for a new book by this author, and To Catch a Witch did not disappoint!I read a lot of cozy mysteries, and Heather Blake's books ALWAYS stand out.  Her style of writing draws you into the story so well that you immediately feel at home.  Despite the long wait for this book, returning to the Enchanted Village felt like no time had passed.  The characters are like family, the shops are like old friends, and the stories are always well-woven.  With some series I'll find myself having a hard time remembering the characters (especially side characters) between books, but that never happens with Ms. Blake.Darcy Merriweather is in the middle of prepping for the annual Wicked Mad Dash when local Abby Stillwell goes missing before the race.  Darcy begins investigating her death within the magical community while her fiance, Nick Sawyer, heads up the police's mortal efforts.  The twists of the mystery of Abby's death along with the other subplots are seamlessly woven together.Not only is Darcy trying to find a killer, she's also worrying about her sister, Harper, whose health has been steadily declining after a breakup.  The reveal of Harper's ""illness"" brings about even more questions of a witchy nature, along with a dose of potential danger if local troublemaker Dorothy Hansel finds out.The cast of characters of this series is amazing.  Pepe and Mrs. P are as adorable as ever (though I'm not sure Pepe would appreciate my calling him adorable).  Evan and Starla are always willing to help Darcy out.  Nick, Mimi, Aunt Ve, and the Elder are ever present.  I've wondered in past books how Darcy's dog Missy would handle Nick and Darcy finally moving in together, and it seems she's starting to favor staying at Aunt Ve's more and more which makes perfect sense.  Even Vince, who readers still don't know if he'll ultimately turn good witch or bad witch, starts to grow on a person in To Catch a Witch (and I'm even finding myself hopeful for the former option, even though his mischief is amusing).  Oh, and I also really enjoyed seeing Dennis Goodman's personality making a peek, along with Glinda showing up with some news (and secrets) of her own.During the course of successfully finding Abby's killer, Harper's illness leads us into the plot of the next book, and boy am I looking forward to it!

When he finally gets there, they find the invisible alien by shooting him with a paintball gun!  Really!

Maybe because the fighting aspect of the storyline didn't resonate at all, I'm not sure.  It was a good book, don't get me wrong.  But I didn't really connect with the characters as much as I would have liked - Nora and her relationship with her family did nothing for me, and I couldn't pull up any sympathy for Logan or Gregg.  And while I enjoy a good, twisty mystery, this one almost had a few too many twists and turns to keep my interest.  I feel dumb saying it was ""too complicated,"" but I reached a point where I just wanted to know already what the eventual end was.

Jen bravely teaches us how to have a heart full of love for Jesus while at the same time having a heart full of love for all he has created that we may have a tendency to forget.This book has a magic way of being extremely personalized to each and every reader, challenging her to dig into her soul and do the work it takes to authentically show up in this world.Thank you for being a leader and a mentor, Jen.",5,0,847,0.142,0
986,"""The New Husband"" was one of the creepiest books I have read.  The author does a great job of portraying the sociopathic behaviors of Simon Fitch, the new man in Nina Garrity's life -- his ability to be charming, warm and loving; his manipulative controlling behavior -- isolating her from her friends; manufacturing situations designed to make her doubt herself and portray him as the injured party; manipulating situations so that when Nina's daughter, Maggie, who does not like or trust Simon, tries to raise concerns about Simon to her mother, it appears that Maggie is just being a bratty pre-teen who misses her father (Glen, who has disappeared and had some major secrets); the quick flashes of darkness in Simon quickly hidden by the façade of normalness he is so great at displaying for the world to see.  It was pretty obvious early on that Simon likely played a role in the disappearance of Glen Garrity, Nina's husband and Connor and Maggie's father, and that he had likely been watching Nina for some time and/or somehow gained information about her and the family from Glen, as he happened to drive the same truck and use the same cologne as Glen and he just happened to cook Nina's favorite meal the first time he made a meal for her, among other things.  However, the truth of what Simon did was much darker and more twisted than I had anticipated.  While that is the biggest plot twists, there are some other good surprises in the book.  Simon is the most complex character in the book, but Maggie is probably my favorite, with her resilience, ingenuity (with the help of her new friend, Ben), and strength of conviction.

It is reminiscent of the classic novels of the Regency era.  The book is the first in a series of books published as Christian Historical Fiction but it does not shy away from drama and the hardness of life in the 1800's.

993,"Fear for your immortal soul is a very real problem in the land of Becar, a realm where those who die are reincarnated based on the goodness of their soul.  Most likely, you'll come back as an animal; a rare few are pure enough to come back as a human.  But the worst of the worst come back as kehoks, monstrous creatures that are random amalgamations of different creatures.  Kehoks live to kill and destroy, and will always reincarnate as nothing but a kehok.  But that hasn't stopped the brave and foolhardy from capturing and training kehoks to run in the annual races.  The prize money is enormous, and the kehok who wins the grand championship is granted a charm that will allow them to reincarnate into a human upon their death.This year, Trainer Tamra desperately needs to sponsor a rider who can win the kehok races.  Her daughter is training to be an auger, a gifted individual who can read a person's aura and determine what kind of creature they will reincarnate into.  But auger school is expensive, and if Tamra can't pay the fees, the augers will assume full custody of her daughter ""for the good of the country,"" and Tamra will never see her daughter again.  So when she finds Raia, a runaway teen with the fire of a person who has nothing to lose, she goes against her better judgement and agrees to train her. And as if the two women weren't already under enough pressure, they soon discover that their kehok is particularly unusual - and its existence soon embroils them in a power struggle for the fate of the country.RACE THE SANDS is an engaging fantasy tale that raises all kinds of questions about morality and what drives a person to be ""good.""  Becar's entire system of power is based upon the system of reincarnation and the fear of what your soul will come back as.  The wealthy maintain control because it is custom to believe that their wealth is a reward from the gods for the purity of their souls - and the fact that aura readings are private keeps anything from assailing this myth.  Augers are those who live unblemished lives and should be given nothing but respect, but does their ability to see your future give them the right to destroy families in their quest for new members?  And Tamra raises and excellent point - she won't remember her past life in her next body, so why should she do anything except what is best for her right now in this moment?  Shouldn't she be good just because it's the right thing to do, not simply because she might come back as a toad in her next life?  These are the kinds of questions kicked around in a story that begins with a very simple premise of ""monster-racing.""Tamra and Raia are two excellent female leads that anchor the adventure. Tamra has a core of iron will power that allows her to control kehoks, and she's the main moral compass of the book.  She's blunt enough to ask questions without concern for rank or etiquette, and pushes an auger who falls into their company to reexamine his beliefs.  Raia, on the other hand, has a spark born of desperation as she escapes from a controlling family, and has to overcome her own self doubts over what she believes is a lifetime of failures. Along with Tamra's daughter Shalla, a family unit is built that has to weather all kinds of storms.The central thrust of RACE THE SANDS is familiar, but no less enjoyable for it.  You have your rookie rider, your curmudgeonly veteran trainer, and the horse monster that everyone believes is untrainable, fighting as the underdogs to win the grand championship race.  But there's an extra layer to RACE THE SANDS that was a surprising and welcome addition to what I was promised on the book jacket.  Yes, this is largely a book about monster-racing, but there's also a level of political intrigue.  There's tension in the capitol city revolving around the soon-to-be-crowned emperor, and those tensions and the attempted manipulations of those involved soon spill into the races themselves, as the capitol is where the final championship race is held.  The stakes elevate just beyond Tamra and Raia's personal problems and become about the fate of the country as a whole.One thing I had to get used to in this book is that it has a magic system that isn't visually flashy.  If you aren't an auger, you can't see auras, and if there wasn't a POV character from an actual auger, we'd have to go on faith that their proclamations about who reincarnates into what are true - which, to be fair, is one of the points of the book. It makes me almost wish that we had only been given POVs of non-augers, to keep us in that same state of uncertainty as the populace as a whole. Regardless, it doesn't stop the book from raising questions about the system, questions  that can be applied to real world religions and how they gain and wield power.RACE THE SANDS is a rousing standalone fantasy adventure, the kind that starts on a small, personal scale and eventually grows to a finale that shakes Becar to its core.  It also scratches that itch of the ""human bonds with a magical creature"" trope, even if these particular magical creatures are reincarnated humans.  If you're in the mood for monsters or racing or a primarily female cast surviving against all odds, RACE THE SANDS delivers on all counts, in one delightful package that doesn't require a series commitment!Note: I was provided an ARC of the book by the publisher in return for my fair and honest review.",4,0,5429,0.155,0

Of course this is a story about shutting down all your social media accounts.  Could you do it—is it actually the reason you are so ill?  Andy has several serious health problems so when he loses another job and the Dt tells him it is because of his addiction to his devices he decided he will try to wean himself off them.  His friend writes for a paper and convinces hi to do it an let hiM write about it.  Of course he becomes famous and people recognize him, which he hates,  Many escapades later—some very funny, many very crazy happenings and a delightful ending.

995,"Leslie is deeply passionate in helping others write their life stories.  Writing personal narrative, she firmly believes, helps us move forward to live more fully.  Her approach in writing memoir involves deconstructing a chronological method and moves you, should you accept her challenge, to write creatively, to keep a word journal (expanding your vocabulary, thus making you a more interesting writer), to use less words to pack a punch and to not belabor the ghosts of your past.  She believes we must write honestly and transparently, but not subject our readers with uninteresting narrative.  She pushes writers to nurture and develop scene to draw readers in and to help them identify with your stories.  She is a serious writer and obviously wants to challenge other writers to who will use written narrative as prayer, exposing truth and being set free in the process.",4,0,878,0.191,0
996,"This is a modern English translation of a Latin poetic treatise on drinking alcohol that was originally published in Germany in 1536.  Readable and relevant, it provides advice on how to drink, what kind of people to drink with, how to keep things in moderation, what kinds of songs to sing, etc.  Both the original Latin text, and a prose translation, are provided.  Latin literature of this period gets hardly any attention, and it is refreshing to see a book like this.  The tone of the work is humorous, but laced with plenty of grounded life advice and cautionary warnings.  All in all, a fascinating work that sheds a lot of light on Reformation-era life in northern Europe.  I should say also that the book itself (the hardcover edition) is beautifully designed.

998,"Delacorte Press and NetGalley provided me with an electronic copy of The Lucky Ones.  I voluntarily chose to review this novel and my opinion is freely given.May survived a school shooting, but does not feel lucky.  Losing her twin brother, her friends, and her favorite teacher has made May feel tremendous guilt and anger.  Though it has been only a year, will May find a way to leave her feelings behind and move forward?Zach has feelings of tremendous guilt, but it is because of his mother.  As the lawyer in charge of defending the school shooter, his mother has made life at exceedingly difficult for Zach and his sister.  When Zach meets May, will the pair be able to put aside their differences and focus on a future?Liz Lawson says it best in her Author's Note: ""The lucky ones who are haunted by what they've faced and by what they have yet to face.  The human beings who are collateral damage of these shootings, who have had their lives ripped out from under them, split open, used for media fodder, and then forgotten when the world moves on."" I like the fact that the author chose to focus on the aftermath of the shooting instead of the actual event.  Readers learn enough of the story and do not need the graphic detail.  May's suffering and pain seems real, especially in the description of the panic attacks.  There were holes in this story, however, that hold The Lucky Ones back from being great.  Without getting into specifics, the shooter is given leeway that is just not realistic.  May gets herself into situations and it seems impossible that she is not found out.  Overall, The Lucky Ones is very timely and involves a situation which is all too common in today's society.  Parents should read this book with their teens, as it can provide a jumping off point for real conversation.",3,0,1810,0.109,0

1001,The introduction of this book gives brief information about the author’s life and his work.  The book is 130 plates from the famous book of “ The Birds of America” (which contained 435 plates).  The exquisite color plates are gorgeous.  Each plate has the name of the bird as most of us know it besides the modern name known by ornithologists.  I loved looking at each plate.  My favorites were the plates where the male and female adults besides the youth were noted.  Sometimes the male and female bird’s difference in color is very small.  I think that this is a wonderful book for everyone to have.  I suspect that it would make a good gift for a birders.Disclaimer:  I received an arc of this ebook from the author/publisher from NetGalley.

Just a simple story of an adventurer (Dale) who comes across an abandoned child of the demon race (Latina) and how he adopts her and she pretty much charms everyone around her.It's fluffy, it's cute.  It's all ""feels"".  I liked it.If I'm going to nitpick, I'd say that the author sometimes confuses a doting father with an otaku.  They are NOT the same thing.  Sometimes Dale acts fatherly and sometimes he acts like an otaku obsessing over his latest figurine.  Very cringe-worthy when that happens, but it doesn't happen too often.Also, an 18yr old who is not only a highly respected world-class adventurer who's also a high priest?  I know it's fantasy, but c'mon!Despite my nitpicking, I really enjoyed the book and hope there's a second one coming.I'm guessing that since it wasn't revealed why Latina was exiled, that will be a topic in the second book?",4,0,879,0.153,1

Julia is a young, single mother who is controlled by an angry, unkind father-in-law.  Garrett is a shipping tycoon who doesn't own a home because he is never in one place long enough.  While back in London for a stay, Garrett meets Julia by accident and it's one of those instant attractions.  As the two come to know one another, it is Julia who resists their being together and speaking of anything long-term. She has secrets that keep her from wanting or able to form any sort of attachments.  This puts Garrett in the unusual position of being the one to want more and want it long-term.  Watching the two come together is fun and full of the tension that makes everything just that much more enticing.  I really liked that Grey writes about a young, single mother who resists love...instead of it being the normal bachelor type.  I like that Garrett does have a softer side...even when he doesn't realize it himself.  I enjoyed the backstory to Julia and her friends and am interested in reading more of the series.  I gave this book 4 stars as I'm not the biggest fan of the instant love/attraction story but I do think that Grey does this well and even the characters admit that the speed of their relationship and intimacy seems crazy.  There is a bit of intrigue with Julia's secret and story with her father-in-law that keeps the reader guessing and on edge just a bit which make the story that much more engaging.

1010,"Brendan J. Donley, age 26, is a sportswriter and the creator and editor of The Big Inning, a website devoted to baseball.  After watching the Chicago Cubs win the 2016 World Series, and inspired by Lawrence Ritter’s oral history classic The Glory of their Times, he decided to write a book about another seven-game World Series.  Donley had two reasons for selecting the 1968 World Series.  First, he was born on the 24th anniversary of the Tigers’ victory in Game 5; second, his grandfather was from Detroit.The book follows the 1968 World Series in chronological order, with a chapter devoted to each of the seven games.  Donley scored an impressive number of player interviews, including 11 Tigers and eight Cardinals who were there.  Both Mickey Lolich and Bob Gibson declined to participate in Donley’s project, probably because they have written their own books about this World Series.Each game is described by the men who played in it, supplemented with line scores and quotes from TV broadcasters Curt Gowdy, George Kell, and Harry Caray. Also contributing were Detroit bullpen coach Hal Naragon, Bill Freehan’s wife Pat, former NBC broadcaster Tony Kubek (who also worked the Series), umpire Bill Haller, and national anthem singer Jose Feliciano.Donley’s skillful editing of the material carries the story, effectively creating suspense reminiscent of the game.  For example, in Game 2 Curt Gowdy calls Norm Cash’s home run, followed by the line score through the top of the sixth inning (3-0, Detroit), comments about Cash from Denny McLain, Tom Matchick, Jim Price, and Naragon, and finally back to the account of the game.  In Game 5 Gowdy’s description of Lou Brock being called out at home plate is transcribed and followed by eyewitness accounts from second baseman Julian Javier, Willie Horton, Don Wert, Mickey Stanley, and Pat Freehan.",5,0,1855,0.095,1

Their mothers are best of friends, and their families are extremely close.  Sidney goes through boyfriends really quickly, and they never seem to make it past ten days, because she finds something wrong with them, and gets easily bored.Sidney and Asher have an epic prank war every summer, that they look forward to and start to make plans for all year long.

Asher proposes that the two of them join forces, by pranking the landlord that kicked their families out.  This along with their families being forced to share a rental, becomes the catalyst for the two of them growing closer.to one another.Asher embraces his feelings for Sidney, but she is scared of getting her heart broken.  They agree to go on four dates with one another to see if they are meant to be together, or should go their separate ways.

He made me swoon with how he treated Sidney, and I loved getting the history between the two of them.  I liked Sidney too.  I felt bad for her, and the way she demanded perfection from herself.

I got frustrated with the way Sidney repeatedly pushed Asher away, and was so quick to give up on him, or believe the worst about him.  However, as the story progressed, we saw her grow and mature.I enjoyed Sidney and Asher's romance, how they knew each other so well, and fit together perfectly.

Nothing wrong with a sequel, and this one is excellent.  The writing is excellent and the setting is historically accurate.

Author and pastor, Ashlee Eiland shares stories and memories of her life from her childhood to her college years and up to today.  She is a black woman who was raised in an upper middle-class family.  She attended private school and her parents are educated and successful in their careers.  As one of only a handful of black students in her school, she often felt as though she didn't quite fit in.  Then when she went off to college, she found out that she didn't quite fit in with the other African Americans either.  Even when she started her career and began to seriously date, she seemed to doubt her own self worth and identity.It is always fascinating to me to see the world through someone else's eyes and experiences.  I think that makes us all more well-rounded people when we are able to do that.  For me personally, it makes me more compassionate and accepting of others. I think that is one objective of Ashlee's writing.  To show us that what we have in common is more than what makes us different.The lessons that Ashlee learned and shares with us are lessons that we could all take to heart.  The color of our skin is not our identity.  The level of our athletic ability or intelligence is not what makes us worthy.  Our worth as humans is found only in God.  He made each of us, black, brown or white in his image and declared us to be very good.  When we see each other through God's eyes,  we will not judge or categorize.  We will extend grace and love.

During our current difficult times, this is a sweet book and may help readers to take a break from their worries.Many thanks to  NetGalley and the publisher for this title in exchange for an honest review.#TheSecretsofLoveStoryBridge #NetGalley",4,0,1829,0.131,0
1019,"Ann Tyler is my favorite contemporary author.  Since I bought Morgan’s Passing at a yard sale over 30 years ago, and promptly purchased every other book she had written at the time, I eagerly anticipated the next book.  I’m a prolific reader but with Ann Tyler, I’d buy the next book immediately and save it for a little while (ok, maybe a week back in the printed book only era) so I could savor it.  As soon as I read the first chapter of her latest in the New York Times, I knew I couldn’t wait.  I downloaded it immediately.  I actually waited 12 hours ( since yesterday!) and now, I’m done.  Sad it’s over but honestly, I think this may be my absolute favorite.  As a Baltimore girl, her stories truly capture the beauty of the seemingly unremarkable individuals who are actually quite captivating.  Ann Tyler is an American treasure.",5,1,839,0.177,1
1020,"Chase’s uncle, a wealthy, eccentric duke, has died under mysterious circumstances.  More mysterious is his will; he has left three large legacies to three unknown women.  Chase is asked by his cousin, the new duke, and the Home Office to find the three women and to investigate his uncle’s death.  Minerva is living a quite life with her two friends/servants thinking of starting an inquiry (detective) agency when she learns of her inheritance from a stranger (Chase) who has broken into her house.This was a page turner not so much because of the mysterious death but because of the development of the romance between the two main characters.  The supporting characters (including the dead uncle) were well done, the introduction to the following two stories was obvious but worked well, but best of all, were the two main characters:  considerate, smart, heroic.Thanks to Netgalley and the publisher for an ARC.",5,0,914,0.164,0
1021,"The Englisch Daughter is an emotion-packed story of betrayal and the struggle toward forgiveness.  Dealing with the issues of infidelity and addiction, it is unlike any Amish story I have ever read.  The plot, impacted by mistrust, deception, broken dreams, manipulation, and misplaced loyalties, is complex with multiple story lines yet easy-to-read and follow.The characters in this narrative are well-crafted and believable, and the surprising conclusion is satisfying.  A strong faith element is present throughout the book, and the story demonstrates that in God’s hands deliberate evil becomes ultimate good.  I enjoyed this read and recommend it especially for fans of Amish romance novels.I received a copy of this book in e-book form from the publisher via netgalley but am under no obligation to write a positive review.

1022,"This book is a fun, albeit highly relevant, look into the social an political evolution of its author, Dave Rubin, and more importantly, serves as a guide and inspiration for those who are marginalized by not adhering to extreme Leftist orthodoxy.  Using personal and public examples, Rubin demonstrates that a person is not the sum of their race, gender or sexuality, but rather the sum of their actions, the quality of their arguments, and their personal integrity.  And of course, Rubin demonstrates that individual freedom, western values and indeed, America herself, are under attack and why they are worthy of a robust defense.On a technical note, the book is not filled with overly wordy monologues, it is not filled with impressive-sounding-but-ultimately-meaningless-superlatives, but rather it is written in a plain, practical, and personal way.",5,0,855,0.172,1

When she arrives, things seem off.  What she finds is a group of overly happy adults, a cemetery with a bunch of recently dug grave, and a group of odd kids addicted to their phones.It's a story that feels like an updated version with a nod to Logan's Run.  It's a horror story where all the gore seems to happen off the page.  I even had a hard time liking the protagonist.

1029,"Even though I came in late to this particular series with the recent holiday novella, I’m absolutely loving the Farm-to-Fork Mystery series.  The characters are realistic, the mysteries well, they certainly “could” happen, and the supporting cast is already a favorite of mine.  Deep Fried Revenge simply cemented my continuing this series with a well planned out, believable Cozy Mystery that kept my attention glued to my Kindle.At the Idaho State Fair, Angie and crew are set to enter into the Boise’s Best Restaurant contest which plays out like a TV reality cooking show with deep-seated rivalries in a contest that everyone is desperate to win.  So much so that one top contender ends up dead by poison and not only is Angie right in the investigation’s crosshairs but she’s determined to discover exactly who committed this crime because she’s not leaving her freedom up to anyone else but herself and her crew.  What follows is a fast-paced search for a killer, an interesting secondary plotline, and so much carnival food that it brought back memories of my own childhood when my parents and I followed our state’s carnival circuit every summer.  I was easily swept up in this Cozy Mystery and didn’t even try to solve it along the way – I was having too much fun for that detail.If you love a really good Cozy Mystery of the foodie style, then you’ll want to pick up Deep Fried Revenge right now and dive into the craziness of the state fair meets a murderer.  I  had a blast and would definitely recommend.*I received an e-ARC of this novel from Kensington Books via NetGalley. That does not change what I think of this story.

1030,"I just had a wonderful escape into the old west, courtesy of author Tom Clavin.  His newest non-fiction gives a detailed look into Tombstone, Arizona and all the people who contributed to the stories that made it one of the most famous towns in the West.I’m not going to lie—there are a lot of names dropped in this book, but they all have a reason to be included.  And there are quite a few footnotes.  Normally, I’m not that interested in the footnotes, but the ones included in the book were just as interesting as the book itself.Clavin also makes quite a few references to other books pertaining to the subject and I loved this!  I have read a few that were mentioned, but I was also able to add a few titles to my out-of-control TBR list.The relationships within the Earp family were very interesting.  Clavin includes a bit of family history in the beginning of the book  and later there is more information about the brothers and their close relationship as well as what happened to them after leaving Tombstone.The politics of the day were also at play in creating the combustive atmosphere that led to battle at the OK Corral and the retribution that occurred afterwards.  In a nutshell, the west was going through many changes during those days and people were on the move trying to seek a fortune in any way possible, legal or not.Readers who love westerns and history will not want to miss this one!  It’s also a great choice to get out of your comfort zone if you aren’t a non-fiction reader.  I loved it and highly recommend it to readers.Many thanks to NetGalley and St. Martin’s Press for allowing me to read an advance copy and give my honest  review.",5,0,1669,0.199,1
1031,"of love and family - in all its many iterations ♥️Told from the 1st person POV, “The Other Family” is a fast paced novel that hit close to home for me.  The storyteller is Ally.  She’s a mom, daughter, almost ex-wife, hairdresser, best friend and medical warrior on behalf of her daughter.  Kylie, a precocious 10 year old, suffers from undetermined autoimmune disease; a battle I faced for years and once named, now fight daily...for exhausting decades.Relationships are the magic of this story and dialogue is the driver.  Author, Loretta Nyhan has done a nice job with both of these aspects.  The story is told entirely in the present tense. Quite frankly, it was a relief not to bounce around multiple time lines for a change!As the story unfolds, we are able to become invested in the lives of Ally and Kiley.  We are privy to their emotions and tho’ts; all seem very honest.  There are highs and lows and moments of humor to alleviate the tension.  The relationship between Ally and her husband, Matt, is especially interesting.  Even tho’ they’re separated and headed for divorce, there’s a positivity and respectful aspect to the relationship that I appreciated.  Both Ally and Kiley are strong women (woman in the making😉) and their relationship with each other and those around them wasinspiring.Nyhan included a bit of a mystery in the story as well.  It’s woven nicely thru the story as a secondary arc and the conclusion is a big W H A T ? ? ?  at the conclusion of this contemporary novel.  No violence or sexual content and just a few gentle expletives make “The Other Family” safe reading for anyone 14 on up.  A good choice📚",4,6,1641,0.184,1
1032,"5 stars go to Gatien for his side of the story of how he brought excitement to New York at at time when the world was changing and kids were looking for the freedom of choice their parents didn't have.  I was a New Yorker during this time so I could totally relate to the craziness of his clubs, although they weren't all my taste, some were a little too crazy!  But, that's what freedom of choice was all about.  In Mayor Giuliani's defense, NYC was becoming a filthy hellhole at the time and the drug scene was out of control so the natural place to start would be the clubs.  It seems that Gatien did his best to control the influx of these substances, but having so many clubs would have been difficult to say the least.  The underbelly of the Feds was described and interesting to say the least.  I totally enjoyed this book....not sure if it was just because I'm from New York!",5,0,883,0.18,1
1033,I've read quite a few FI books and this is far and away the best.  Why is it the best?  Because Grant gives you step by step actionable items.  No vagueness.  Do these things in this order.  Almost a recipe if you will.  It is very much to the point.  A lot of authors seem to want to up their page count with a lot of fluff and filler.  To all would be authors out there guess what?  I would pay the same if not more for a book with fewer pages that just gets to the point.  I don't think I'm alone in that either.  Number of pages does not equal more value.  People (myself included) don't do the math on how many pages I'm getting for my money.  It's a book not a bottle of shampoo.  I have already implemented several of Grant's suggestions.  Thank you Grant for taking a huge world of information and condensing it down to a practical how to guide.,5,0,853,0.134,0
1034,"I enjoy Paulette Jibes’ writing style and her description of the wildness of the Southwest.  Her writing is a combination of poetry and prose and the reader is drawn into the storyline within the framework of settings in the countryside and early cities of Texas.  Her characters are strong and independent and represent the spirit of the early settlers and dreamers in this country.  Simon, the protagonist, is an energetic, lover of music, a self-made decent young man who has made his money by playing his beloved fiddle in service to the Confederate Army and after the war throughout Texas.  He has dreams that he is willing to follow in spite of many obstacles that would discourage most men.  The story is replete with references to the terrain, rivers and vegetation in Texas.

I learned a lot about the needlework of Queen Elizabeth I and Mary Queen of Scots.  While I understand another reviewer's complaint about more paintings than needlework pictured in the book, I suspect that is due to the lack of surviving examples.  I would have liked it if the author had translated the Old English and foreign titles, but otherwise I found the book helpful and of interest.  I never understood the value of tapestries to the time of Henry VII, Henry VIII and Queen Elizabeth I before I read this book.  The images helped explain the value of this.  While I would have preferred more information on the embroideries, this is a very good overall book about Tudor Textiles and after all that was the title.",4,0,848,0.119,1

1037,"BORDER BREACH by Darlene L. Turner is the amazing, fast paced story of Canada Border Officer Kaylin Poirier and police constable Hudson Steeves as they work together to crack a drug-smuggling ring.Kaylin Poirier has a lot to prove, to her department, to her father and to herself.  Her time living on the streets gave her determination and her time living with Diane, when she took her in, gave her hope for a future which led her to applying for the job with CBSA.  The one thing she hasn’t found is faith in religion.  Still feeling the after effects of her upbringing and a failed romance, Kaylin is determined to prove she has value and that she can fulfill her job with honor and skill.Hudson Steeves has finally battled his way out of the dark tunnel after he found out his fiancé was dating two other men at the same time she claimed to have loved him.  His faith was his strong hold in winning that battle.  Now he must concentrate on finding the drug lords and stop the smuggling operation that landed his nephew in a local hospital hanging to life by a thread.Can Kaylin and Hudson work together after the fiasco of the last time they worked together?  After Kaylin’s life is threatened, not once but several times, can Hudson continue to keep her safe?  Will the death of Kaylin’s ex-fiancé, who had escaped from prison, end the nightmare or will the terror continue?  Is the abduction of Kaylin’s father and all the murders connected?  Had God abandoned Kaylin in the past or was it God that sent the right help at the right time only in a form different from what Kaylin was looking for?  Will the faith of Diane and Hudson and their lives by example open up Kaylin’s mind that God does exist?  Can they find Kaylin’s Dad before he’s killed too?  Can Kaylin and Hudson stop to drug smuggling before more people die?Darlene L. Turner wrote a book that everyone can fall in love with.  It has danger, suspense, romance and faith all rolled into a wonderfully written story that will have you turning pages rooting for not only for the good guys to win but for Kaylin and Hudson to find their way to each other.  Love the way the author addresses faith – the lack of it in some and the strength of it in others.  She shows that all things are answered, but in God’s way and his time.  It reminds us that all we have to do is be open to God’s love and to ask.Highly recommend BORDER BREACH to anyone that loves a great book that will touch your heart, get your adrenaline pumping and give you food for thought.

After Kayode (the father) refused to print posters for Boko Haram in his print shop, he was a target for the group.  The family tried to move to another city in Nigeria but were followed.  After a stint with a family member in Dallas, they eventually ended up in New York City.  Here the younger son Tanitoluwa (Tani for short) became enamored with chess.  As his parents try to make it with various low-paying jobs, it becomes clear that Tani has a real talent for chess and that he loves the ""deep thinking"" that comes with it.  As Kayode says, this story illustrates that ""talent is universal, opportunity is not.""This book was amazing to listen to on audio.  It was done by three narrators, one for Tani, one for his father Kayode, and one for his mother Oluwatoyin.  I at first thought that the parents narrated their own chapters because the speakers shared the accent, but that was not the case.  This book was a great reminder of the good that the US is capable of.  It was also a wonderful story of humility.  After not being able to work in Dallas without the necessary papers, Kayode is honored to work in New York.  He starts off working the night shift cleaning up at a restaurant, which is very intense physical work at a very low rate.  But he is so honored that he once again can work for his family.  I loved learning about this beautiful family, who were always quick to thank God for the good things in their lives.  I also appreciated the glimpse into Nigerian culture.

1043,"I sampled the book and gave up in amazement that the book was being praised so highly.  It's not well written and the author did not do ""meticulous"" research as the publisher claims.The First Century narrator says ""All my life, longings lived inside of me, rising up like nocturnes to wail and sing through the night.""  The night prayers called Nocturns or Nocturnes did not exist in the first decades of the first century when the opening of the book is set.  There was no Church and there was no Christianity.  You can't trust an author who makes a mistake like that about Christian worship.  If for some reason she meant the musical nocturne, that's even more of a blunder, since that didn't exist until the 1800s....Likewise, there were at the time three pilgrimage festivals during which the Hebrews were supposed to make pilgrimages to Jerusalem, but the narrator says her father went up to Jerusalem for Passover and Sukkoth and doesn't mention the third, Shavuoth.  That's a pretty gross blunder and throws into doubt Kidd's comprehension of Jewish life in that period.  Then she says that during a walk through a crowded market place  she hears ""snatches"" of Aramaic.  That doesn't make any sense: Aramaic was the lingua franca of the Jews in the eastern Mediterranean.  The narrator would have been *surrounded* by Aramaic speakers.These are basic facts about the period and about Jewish life in the First Century anyone can easily look up--how did Kidd manage to get them wrong? And how did her editor not wince at laughable images like ""Her mind was an immense feral country that spilled its borders""?  There are more lines in the opening that just made me laugh they were so awful.  I haven't read anything of Kidd's before, and the poor grasp of historical detail and the shaky prose don't encourage me to try.",1,1,1824,0.081,1

This author uses words to paint a beautiful picture.  I enjoy historical fiction and it is evident that the author did extensive research to keep the integrity of the story.  Westward migration came at a tremendous cost for the indigenous people.  This story only hints at what will be coming and we are given a small peek into their life.  They were viewed as savages, but the author does a good job of depicting them as humans that followed a different way of life, one that followed in the footsteps of their ancestors.  Cruelty does not have a color.  It does not have a nationality.  Cruelty exists when we allow it to lead.  This book shows this from both sides.",4,0,830,0.106,0

This is more about a man who came from a relatively humble background who blazed a trail into the upper echelons of international fashion and became friends with just about every famous designer and wrote for most of the important fashion publications - Women's Wear Daily, Vogue, Vanity Fair.  He's quite honest about his life and his shortcomings.  My only criticism is I started losing interest towards the end.  There's only so many descriptions of people's clothes that I want to read.",4,0,832,0.146,1
1049,"This book is the second in a series of books from Julian Lennon, John Lennon’s son.The series is titled: “White Feather Flier Adventures,” written as a tribute to the memory of Julian’s dad and for the benefit of the White Feather Foundation, founded by Julian to help heal the earth.This second installment is titled “Heal the Earth.”The book is beautifully illustrated in a way that will appeal to young children. The wording stays with a vocabulary that they can understand, while managing to get the point across.The book “empowers” children to almost magically heal the earth and its inhabitants in various ways.Of course, that is impossible in a literal way, but children think more simplistically than we older ones do.I think the book is intended to make children aware that the earth needs healing, rather than suggesting that fixing her problems is a piece of cake.I have mixed feelings as to whether or not this is an effective approach.The book has an odd feature, where the child is encouraged to push a button to see what happens on the next page.The buttons are just printed, and of course they don't actually work.If your child has any experience with interactive books, I think he will be keenly disappointed.Perhaps if you explain to him up front that this is all about using his imagination, he will not feel as let down.The words and pictures of “Heal the Earth” are very well executed, but the concept that a child can do this very simplistically with the push of an imaginary button doesn't sit well with me.But again, discussing the book with your child might go a long way in bridging that gap.Because I would give this book five stars for its vocabulary and illustrations, but three or less for context and useless “buttons,” I will bridge my own gap with a four star rating.",4,1,1800,0.067,1
1050,"What an emotional ride you will take when you open the book and find yourself drawn into the story.  The author does a wonderful job of developing the characters and making you care deeply about their grief.  The sisters-in-law are very different in many ways ... their personalities, their individual marital relationships, the way they deal with grief, their financial situation.So this is not only a journey in the form of an ultramarathon, but also a journey they take to honor the memory of their husbands will force them to take a hard look at what they expect from life and a self discovery of love, hope, forgiveness, and grace.Thank you to NetGalley, Thomas Nelson Publishers, and the author for an ARC in exchange for my honest review.

This is a rare book that provides both expert consultants and those that want to raise their game a road map and depth of explanation about what being an Advanced Practitioner really means.  It is not for everyone as this journey requires a continued willingness to learn, with the emotional and practical intelligence to fully understand where you are in the spectrum of your own experience and development.

The kids climb on a magic white feather, go to the troubled areas & make things better.  It is a simple story with a complicated message – a good starting point in a discussion of the environment & what can be done to improve things.  The message may go over a child’s head but I am always amazed how much children can accomplish when given the chance to let their minds fly free.  What may start as a simple discussion, may lead to changing the world.It felt a bit odd that the health care & environmental problems are both in this one book.  The message became a bit diluted.  I think two separate books would have made greater impact.The illustrations are simple but colorful & engaging – very well done.",4,0,828,0.218,1
1053,"Two things stand out for me after reading Walk The Wire, David Baldacci's latest installment in the Amos Decker series.  If you have followed Decker in the previous books, you know that a freak incident during Decker's brief pro football career left him with a ""perfect"" memory because of which, he never forgets anything.  Decker has used his ""gift"" to become one of the top investigators for the FBI, but the same ""gift"" of an infallable memory has left Decker woefully short of interpersonal skills.  In Walk The Wire, Baldacci spends less time in exploring Decker's perfect memory and puts more emphasis on his efforts to adjust his personal relationships with Alex Jamison, his FBI partner, and his siblings whom he has mostly ignored since the murder of his wife and daughter which occurred in the first book of this series. That is point number 1; number 2 is that Baldacci brings in to the action his 2 major characters from another of his series, ace government snipers Will Robey and Jessica Reel.  Robey and Reel take on the role of ""the cavalry,"" showing up in the nick of time to save Decker and Jamison from swarms of mercenaries who have turned up in North Dakota for reasons related to a mysterious former Air Force base.  While solving a series of murders which appear to be related to the airbase and/or the fracking operations being conducted nearby, our heros also uncover several black ops which center on the airbase and, coincedentally, solve the murders, but not before a final showdown with the murderer.  Whether Decker and Jamison will ""reciprocate"" by appearing in the next Will Robey novel remains to be seen, but for this first joint appearance, they blended their respective talents rather well.",5,0,1726,0.105,0

At any rate, I love the way that Ana is portrayed, as an imperfect human....allowing her to learn and grow from the beautiful examples that Jesus displays through his patience, forgiveness and lack of judgement of others.  They truly love one another.  Ana longed for a voice and had a strong desire to tell the stories of women who were treated with little regard, often abused and considered as property to their fathers and husbands.  Having been educated, she is possessed to write the stories, often putting herself in peril.  At the same time, watching the series The Chosen, both the book and this series present Jesus in a consistently human way unlike anything I’ve seen.

I loved it *intermittently*.  Parts were poignant, the language was exquisite, and the hapless heroine (the primary one) sympathetic and engaging, even if sometimes exasperatingly oblivious -- especially in light of her academic achievements and otherwise, at least ostensibly, highly analytical mind.I can't say more without perpetrating spoilers, but I'll venture the following (a very minor one):The entire convoluted story ended, literally, in the catacombs beneath Paris, so for all that a (not wholly plausible) resolution of all the knots was provided, it has to be said that here you have a novel that is, in a literal sense, ""crypt-ic.""  ☺",4,0,838,0.147,0

I had the opportunity and honor to spend hours recently with author Bob Maras as he personally related to me the details of several of the events he experienced in the hills of Khe Sanh.  Nothing in my own combat experience over North Vietnam and Laos comes close to the gut-wrenching events Bob and his fellow Marines fought through and endured day after day, night after night, in the blood-stained hill tops and valleys of Khe Sanh.  I rate this book SIX STARS and (if I had the power to do so) would make this required reading in every high school in our country - would not hurt to have college-age kids also understand what many of the Vietnam-era military ""kids"" endured and sacrificed during that time in our country's history.",5,0,882,0.117,0

Having the actual physical book, keeping the kid(s) entertained, along with the anticipation of seeing anything indigenous to a particular area, will make a vacation even more memorable for both kids and their adults.This ebook was even good, though we couldn't actually write on the screen.

Her name was  Misty (Poco Misty Lady) and like Buck was fairly nondescript sorrel with a royal grandfather reflected in her name... she taught me nearly everything that I know of horses and horsemanship, but it wasn't until I read this book that I recognized how much she taught me about handling horses.  It wasn't until I read this book that I realized how well those lessons could be applied in how I handle myself and other people.  I truly hope you have had or will a teacher who is as kind and patient as the author's Buck, or my Misty... whatever form your teacher comes in.

Most of them are fairly simple and the directions are easy to follow (which is saying a lot from me as I usually struggle with visual instructions).  We have made several of the options together and while my child has struggled a bit with some of it, he is getting the hang of it and having fun.  I would highly recommend this as a boredom buster.  Easy to do anywhere at home or in the car.  The only issue I have with it is it does not include paper.  I wish they would at least include a small pack of paper with the book.

The simple story shines all the better in our rushed and jaded age of info and activity overwhelm.  This story might be called simplistic, and it is, and that's part of the charm.  The light and clean storyline is like the kite string that starts the building of a bridge across the canyon:  a simple pathway is the easiest one to latch onto and travel on in hope.So the story is just a fun tale on the surface, with layers also; thus it is an enduring treasure.",5,0,846,0.216,1

Take, for example, page 170 Classic Vegetable Soup.  The only fat in the recipe comes from 6 TBSPs of olive oil which amounts to 720 calories (=120 cal x 6).  The other ingredients are fat-negligible.  How is it possible that there are 469 calories per serving or 42.6 g of fat per serving?  Moreover, if the soup serves 4, how is it possible that there be 1,876 total calories for this dish (=469 kcal x 6) if only 6 TBSPs of fat are required?  Odd, isn't it?  Is my math off or someone else's?

1064,"I'm reading this book for the second time.  This time with Mike reading it via Audible.  He's a phenomenal speaker so he reads his own book with perfect energy and nuance and brings out things I didn't read just on the page alone. I highly recommend both methods of combing through this wondrous journey.  During this time of isolation especially, but in all times, Mike helps illuminate why we do & why we don't do behaviors in life, habits, compulsions, & relationships.  Mike is a generous writer, deeply vulnerable and honest.  He is generous and caretaking with the immense amount of research and observation he has immersed himself in for years in and writes about it all in such a way that everyone can find it accessible.  This, of course is what he does all the time on his podcast, ""Ask Science Mike"" and he does it in spades in this second book of his.  His first book, ""Finding God in the Waves"" was life-changing for me, by the way.  This second book is another raw look into Mike's life, heart and soul and is also a totally useful and relatable way to look at how our brains and bodies work together which explains why we do or don't do everything.  Besides all of my somewhat objective observation of this marvelous book, there's this personal piece for me as well:  At the end of chapter 7, Mike writes, ""Humans are social primates.  I don't believe there is any path to health and wholeness that can be taken alone.""  This is part of why this season of humanity, the pandemic and social isolation has been so difficult for most of us.  But I also want to assert that Mike's work and his entire family have absolutely been a part of my personal ""path to health and wholeness"" and I couldn't be more grateful.",5,0,1725,0.119,1
1065,"Full Disclosure - I was offered a free copy of his most recent book, Put Your Dream to the Test, by publisher Thomas Nelson as part of their ""book review bloggers"" program [...].Maxwell's newest book, Put Your Dream to the Test, provides a road map to determine how fully developed your dream really is.  Using a series of ten questions, and a case study associated with each one, Maxwell takes the reader through the process of thinking about and understanding the nature of a dream.  His contention is that if you go through the process of thinking about your dream so you can answer each of the questions with a ""yes"", you'll be much better prepared to realize the dream you have.Maxwell's style is always interesting to me.  He provides easy-to-read stories that tie in quite nicely to the issues he's trying to illustrate.  For instance, in dealing with ""The Clarity Question - Do I Clearly See My Dream?"", Maxwell provides the story of Mike Hyatt, the CEO of Thomas Nelson, Inc.  Hyatt took the reigns of a division of Thomas Nelson under stressful circumstances and with no idea that it was going to happen.  Maxwell provides an account of Hyatt's experiences in developing a clear strategy to bring his division out of the negative situation it was in.  Maxwell then illustrates the principle of how important it is to clarify your dream by linking back to specific events in Hyatt's story.  The real-life example makes the principle come alive.Put Your Dream to the Test is another in a long line of great books by John C. Maxwell.  Specific answers to the questions brought up in the book will provide you with a blueprint of how to go about refining and living out your dream.",5,0,1687,0.15,0

Full transparency - I'm someone who is very picky about what they read and often vet on Goodreads or wait for a few friends to recommend a book, and yet I'd happily pass ""The Wedge"" down the stream (and already have bought books for 3 friends!).The book is all about the meta behind exploring your body's limits - listening, understanding and exploiting our physiology & psychology to level up both in our abilities and our experience.

1073,"After years of learning from the leadership insights of Dan Reiland (danreiland.com), I was excited to read his new book Confident Leader.  It exceeded expectations!  Dan has a gift of discernment that sees through the complexities of leading in today’s culture and provides practical handles of assessment and growth.This book is divided into three sections.  The first, “Deep Foundational Decisions,” unpacks several key elements in understanding who you are as a leader and how that provides the bedrock for your leadership confidence.  It was so encouraging for me to read that confidence is a muscle that you can build/develop. Additionally, the section on the enemies of fear & insecurity in the life of a leader was invaluable.  The second, “Deliberate Character Development,” focuses on five areas of a leader’s character that provide the underpinning of strength necessary to lead well.  One of those discussed that resonated with me was understanding the importance of authority; where it comes from and how it is uniquely different from influence or power.  When I see authority as a sacred trust extended by God and others, I am challenged to steward it well rather than become filled with pride and abuse it.  The last section, “Daily Practical Disciples,” brings together the notion that both competence and confidence are necessary for leading well.  This begins with a reminder that leadership requires leaders to know where they are going and providing direction for those that follow them.  Yet, it was the chapter emphasizing a leader’s heart that most resonated with me.  Throughout the book, there are conversations with other leaders that provide additional depth of insights.  As it relates to a leader’s heart, Dr. Crawford Loritts explains, “it’s important to love the people more than I love what I do for the people.” So good!  And such a powerful reminder that leadership is about serving others, rather than making a name for ourselves.  No matter where you find yourself on the leadership journey, Confident Leader! is a must read.  It is a book that offers probing reflection, tangible steps for improvement, and the inspiration needed to move forward.  After reading it personally, our staff team added it as our monthly development resource and it fueled hours of rich conversation.

Working on body image issues and the purpose of my body has and still is an on going process.  They way Jen speaks through her written words just as a girlfriend sitting across from me.  This book is necessary for all ages, I wish when I was in my 20's I had read something so meaningful for women.  I also just started the audiobook!  Cant wait to hear the book spoke by Jen.  A MUST read!",5,0,845,0.175,1
1082,"My favorite part of JS Scott books is how she incorporates heart, heat, all the feels and HEA all within a story that has depth atypical for a usual romance novel.  The Sinclairs have been such a great series.  I've loved everyone #JSScottJunkie.  Brooding Noah with his undying commitment to family and a deathbed wish to his mother.  Free spirit Andie with a live every day like it's your last mantra.  She promises his brother to help Noah have a life outside work, find some fun and enjoy his new found wealth.  But along the way he finds his purpose is to help her trust that the future has promise and love.  JS Scott's books are the kind you have to read twice bc you get so ingrained in ""I have to know what happens next!"" that you breeze through and need to go back for the little details you may have missed.  You will love this book as I did, guaranteed!",5,0,865,0.298,0

1084,"In 1865, Simon Boudlin has managed to evade conscription by the Confederate Army as he travels around the South earning his living through playing beautiful and rousing tunes on his fiddle.  His luck runs out and he is conscripted at the end of the war into the Confederate Army as a fiddler and takes part in one last battle, the Battle of Los Palmitos.  Afterwards, Simon puts together a rag tag band of former confederates and union soldiers to earn a living playing at a variety of events.  At one such event, Simon sees Doris Mary Dillon and is instantly smitten.  Doris is an Irish governess for a Union Colonel’s family. She is indentured under a three-year contract and has to endure harsh treatment from the Colonel.  Simon dreams of owning his own piece of land and of marrying Doris.  Will Simon be able to fulfill his dreams?I loved this book. It was beautifully written; I liked to slowly read and savor each sentence. It was told in a style of vignettes of different points in Simon’s journey through Texas.  I loved how times were harsh, but Simon and his band had to pull things together to survive.  Will they have enough food?  Will yellow fever carry them all off?  Where will they live?  What will they do without papers showing a formal dismissal from the army?  I also loved Doris’s journey.  It would be strange to be an immigrant in a strange land under the control of someone who has anger issues and that you have to be worried about trying to molest or rape you.  She had joy in life and was tamped down by the Colonel.  The old fashion romance between her and Simon through letters was very enjoyable.  The story was mostly told through Simon’s point of view, but also was told through her point of view as well.  I enjoyed how the story unfolded and gave us deeper background on characters as the story progressed.  I also loved the map on the inside cover of the book.  I looked at it often to think about and visualize Simon’s journey.I have not read Jiles’s novel News of the World, but I need to move it further up my to read list.  The only downfall of Simon the Fiddler was that it ended.  I wanted to continue the journey of Simon and Doris.What are your favorite novels of the Civil War, musicians, or the frontier?Favorite Quotes:“They were living in a world of returned soldiers who had fought, had seen death and destruction, suffered hunger and want, and were not afraid of Satan himself.”“The Long Battle cries of the war had faded and now life settled down the way a bombed building settles down, extinguishing all the lamps as the walls fold in and it was a every man for himself, a kind of societal darkness or twilight that would take a long time to lift.”“He was born into a world of horse traders and was well acquainted with deception and the need for caution at every step when it came to buying and selling.”“He saw all the hard road before them unrolling like a scroll and their names there, for better or for worse, written in the Book of Life.”Overall, Simon the Fiddler was a beautifully written novel with unforgettable characters set at the end of the Civil War.

1085,"The love of summer baseball--the sights, the sounds, the murmur of the crowds, the players--comes through loud and clear in this entertaining and delightful book about college players competing in wood bat leagues after their college seasons have ended.  The players are all striving, realistically or not, for some improvement and recognition and the chance, at some later stage of development, to make it in professional baseball.  Geoghegan traveled across the country to take in games, interview players and coaches, and presents a vivid picture of why baseball is America's pastime.  The author's road trip takes him from Cape Cod to Alaska.  He sees games played at midnight and games played in front of sparse crowds.  Each chapter introduces us to a new team of players, coaches, and owners, and Geoghegan relates their stories in clear prose.  If you like baseball, you'll like this book.",5,0,897,0.172,1

That one traced the personalities that drove the explosion in sports salaries and sports economics in general.  That story was inherently interesting to me, and Futterman completely delivered.  Long distance running training is not an inherently interesting topic to me.  But I was betting on the author to know a good story if he found one, and to tell it well.  He sure did!  Amazing personalities, made-for-Hollywood races, and I loved the autobiographical inserts from the humble marathoner who runs 1 hour+ behind the elites.  I read it during a lovely fall weekend in NYC, with Prospect Park full of high school cross country teams running the fields, and the marathoners with their sights set on the New York race, pounding it out on the outer loop.

I truly believe her when she says that true transformation must start in your mind and heart then burn through the rest of your body.  One of my favorite parts of the book is this quote:  ""You cannot live the life of your dreams while operating in the same mindset that broke you down.""  Christine knows what it's like to struggle - in life, with weight, etc.  She candidly shares her struggles and shares excellent tips on how she overcame those struggles.  The book - and her plan - are easy to understand and read through.

1090,"The Human Son is a unique book, even by the standards of science fiction.  It's a book about the future of humanity and life on Earth -- but this future is not determined by conflict or struggle.  The predator-prey relationships that characterize the world of nature are nowhere to be found.  Instead, the future is arbitrated by post-humans who stand far above the world of nature, who believe themselves to be above war and violence, and who attempt to determine mankind's appropriate destiny in a lengthy process that's semi-judicial, semi-scientific, and, in principle, entirely rational...But only in principle.Suffice it to say that The Human Son was a very thoughtful read, which, at points, made me very reflective and gave me a lot to think about.  It is probably the best science fiction book of the year thus far.  There are very few books quite like it.",5,0,865,0.095,0
1091,"Is there a way to move on after World War II if you were part of the Nazi war machine?Clara Falkenberg was young, beautiful, and had a head for business.  She ran her family’s ironworks during World War II and was called the “Iron Fraulein” in the Nazi propaganda. Clara escaped before the end of the war and has been living under an assumed name.  She finally returns to her hometown to try to track down her best friend Elisa and Elisa’s son Willy.  She is tracked along the way by a British officer who wants to see her in jail for her war crimes.  Will Clara find Elisa and Willy?  What secrets will she uncover?  Can she move on from what happened during the war?The German Heiress was a fast-paced suspense novel and I very much enjoyed it.  I liked the shades of grey that the plot involved.  Clara was part of the Nazi regime and she did use forced labor from other countries.  She did know it was wrong and tried to help when she could, but was it enough?  Is she a criminal?  This is something that has fascinated me for years.  We had a local gentleman that was a guard for a very short period of time in a concentration camp and they were trying to extradite him when he was in his 90’s.  At what point should people be accountable for their actions?  Can you ever be forgiven?  I liked that Clara was a strong female lead and that this story was set after World War II in Germany, which is a time period that is not often covered in historical fiction novels.Overall, The German Heiress was a compelling suspense and historical fiction novel with a strong female lead and an interesting moral quandary.Book Source:  Review Copy from William Morrow.

1093,"Wrestling fans, young and old alike, know that André the Giant is one of the true legends of the business, but what some may not know was that his match with Hulk Hogan in Wrestlemania III was not the start of his career as he was quite successful for many years prior to that match in which many became familiar with the “Gentle Giant”.  This biography by Bertrand Hebert and Pat Laprade is a very complete work telling the life and career of the wrestling icon.Born André René Roussimoff, the book follows him through his childhood to his various jobs before getting his start in professional wrestling in Paris at age 18. From there, he went on to enjoy success in Japan and the province of Quebec, becoming a big attraction for wrestling fans in the province, most notably in Montreal and Quebec City.  His French roots and ability to speak the language helped him tremendously in the province and it provided him exposure to other promoters.  One in particular, Vince McMahon Sr, saw André perform and signed him to wrestle for the then-WWF (now WWE).  The authors do a commendable job of research and writing about this part of Andre’s life and career as it is not as well known as his later years in WWF and his rivalry with Hulk Hogan.The story of André’s personal life, which included not only the acromegaly that made him the size that he was, but also his addiction to alcohol, his dislike of certain aspects of the life of a celebrity such as his distaste for flying, and also his lack of a romantic partner for most of his life, is treated with detail but fairness. There is not criticism for these aspects of André’s life and that makes for a terrific and fair read for those readers not familiar with his life.  This is also true for the discussion of André and his work in Hollywood and the movies he appeared in, most notably The Princess Bride.Of course, Andre’s legendary time with WWF and his appeal with fans after his match with Hogan is covered with the same amount of research and detail and fans who are familiar with this part of his career will thoroughly enjoy reliving some of his best matches in sold-out arenas that are described in this portion of the book.  It is here where the reader will learn much more about his personal life described above and also his injuries and diseases that would trouble him for the rest of career and his life outside the ring until his death in early 1993.It should be noted that this book is not only an excellent account of André’s life and career, but also one about the business of professional wrestling. The details behind the contracts, agreements between promoters to let wrestlers perform for several wrestling promoters at the same time and how the matches are determined on how the heels or baby-faces will win in order to gain either maximum followings or ensure that there will be demand for rematches is great reading.  This reviewer has read wrestling books from this publisher in the past and every one on them, including this one, cover this aspect of professional wrestling thoroughly and they and the authors should be commended for brining the reader into this world.Any wrestling fan who remembers André the Giant will want to add this book to their collection.  While it is a long read at 550 pages, it is one that is worth the investment of their time to complete.  I consider it to be one of the best books I have read on professional wrestling.",5,0,3434,0.137,0

The book is based on his principle that everyone can make room in their schedules and in their hearts, to listen to God.  The chapters are short and full of real-life analogies.  The exercises at the end of the chapters are great lead ins for reflection and prayer:  they help you experience what you just read about.Honestly, I've been praying a long time and was not expecting the book to be as fruitful as it was.  The only thing was that I read through it fairly quickly, and now want to go back and 'savor' different prayers and guidance.

The writing feels like floating deliciously down a clear mountain stream inside the mind and body of protagonist Elizabeth, including realistic rocky sections.  As Elizabeth tries to identify the main thesis in her art history dissertation on Georgia O’Keefe, the artist’s actions, reactions, and paintings guide Elizabeth into parts of herself that she hadn’t known existed, leading to a greater understanding of both women as well as an opportunity to reflect on our own life choices and opportunities.

1099,"Rachel Lance's book is the tale of two stories -- the successful mission and demise of the C.S.S. Hunley, and Lance's quest to find the cause of the submarine's abrupt disappearance after its 1864 attack on the U.S.S. Housatonic in Charleston harbor.  She interweaves these two narratives throughout the book.  The latter topic was the subject of her PhD thesis and probably occupies a slight majority of the book.  While interesting, I think many readers will find the minutiae of her graduate school experience at Duke University to be a bit tedious, although it's a convincing account of the scientific rigor of her inquiry.  I found the sections on the Hunley's design, its attack on the Housatonic, and its loss and discovery 130 years later to be more interesting.  It's a unique story, and undeniably the book is a worthwhile read and a fine contribution to its subject.  However, it badly needed some visual support, for example a map of Charleston harbor and a diagram of the Hunley's attack run and eventual underwater resting place would have been helpful, as well as photos or diagrams of some of Lance's testing devices that led to her conclusion that the Hunley's crew died of internal injuries from the explosion of its own torpedo that sunk the Housatonic.  Oddly, there are only a few, small line drawings of the submarine's design.  A minor subtext of the book that I found to be very interesting is its suggestion that the Friends of the Hunley organization that has assumed curation of much of the submarine's public image has sought to sanitize some of the Civil War history that was contemporaneous with the Hunley's brief existence.  Lance describes how a historian associated with Friends of the Hunley ignored archival evidence that two slaves died while manning a prototype submarine that predated the Hunley.  ""He leads readers to believe the story of two noble Confederate men, trying to sink a federal warship, editing the deaths of the enslaved men out of history.""  Then, there's the parting shot:  ""When I last toured the (Warren Lasch Conservation Center in Charleston that now houses the Hunley) I was unable to find, even in the sections dedicated to general Civil War history, a single mention of slavery.""  The Friends of the Hunley does have a very good and well illustrated website that gives a detailed account of the Hunley's design, discovery, restoration, its crew, and its current public display.",4,0,2440,0.106,0

We always look forward to a new book in this series.  We were so disappointed in this book.  It was a mess.  There were too many plots that got resolved with little consequence, stilted conversations that only served to shove political views down our throats, and no character development.  All of Baldacci’s books are getting increasingly political and we do not appreciate that.  Dropping Will Robie into this book didn’t seem to serve any purpose and didn’t enhance it, for sure.

Her significant other, Deputy and ex-Marine, Carter Leblanc, is kind of her competitor and cohort at the same time.  Ida Belle and Gertie are her senior citizen sidekicks.  As the 16th book in the series, with only 1 or 2 kind of lemons, Jana DeLeon has delivered pretty consistently good stories and push the Fortune overarching plot along to where she is no longer hiding.  The books have changed some too, this is more mystery with humor as opposed to more humor and slapstick than mystery.  It's one of her better-plotted stories, but not as funny as the early books.  Read and enjoy!  Note: The $5.99 price is pushing the limit for a book less than 300 pages.  DeLeon will be losing sales soon just like Janet Evanovich.",4,0,864,0.101,0
1107,"This is an okay read.Not fascinating and at times it slows to a bit of a crawl.  I kept reading because I liked our sisters and really wanted to know the story behind how they ended up, well, sisters.The solution to that mystery was...odd.  Really odd.  Not odd in an impossible way.  Just in a 'wow did we just entirely change the theme of this book' kind of way.  It's like the book changes from women's fictions about love, life, infidelity, etc. to hey, in the last 10% of the book we're going to turn this into a maybe-thriller.Weird.There are enough loose ends for a follow up book and, if that book does turn out to be a thriller, I'd be curious to read it.  Also, one of the male characters (tragic but handsome and strong type) needs his own book with his one HEA.So, not really what I expected, but okay.",3,0,814,0.178,1
1108,"Charlie and Emma were high school and college sweethearts until Charlie was lured away to the big city by an older woman who offered her a job and eventually herself.  After several years Darcy kicks Charlie to the curb and she is left with no choice but to return to the small town where she grew up.  She never expected to find Emma there too…This book is well written, but let’s face it, everything Ms Beers writes is.  It is an emotional second chance romance full of love, angst, self-doubts and regrets as well as hope and determination.  I liked the story, it was sweet and adorable but it didn’t feel complete.  There were no real dates, the hours they work are too different, Emma’s mom is also a problem BUT if you look at this as a “leave it to you to imagine the ending” love story, it works pretty well.",3,0,816,0.282,0
1109,"TL; DR (not going to read?):  There's a reason this book is drowning in five star reviews.  It's uplifting and the writing is excellent.  Much around us is misery right now, so buy yourself an antidote.  This said, take two minutes to read the rest of this review if you aren't convinced.***After reading the other reviews, I feel a bit like I'm repeating them.  But the message bears repeating:  We are living through an upsetting time.  Many of us feel isolated and scared.  None of us feel normal.  As a result, it's tough to remember that there are lots of good people in the world -- and that doing small things matter.  Aronson is here to remind us that those people exist, and that small things can have a huge impact.Aronson is an excellent writer -- clear and concise, with a real sense of how to tell a story.  Each story he includes will warm your heart; indeed, if your heart is too small, it may well grow three sizes by the time you are done reading.  (Apologies, Dr. Seuss.)  The stories also will inspire you to action, be it donating a dollar, writing a letter, picking up the phone, dropping off a meal, acknowledging someone who is having a tough time, or doing one of the  many other things Aronson discusses.Last, but not certainly not least, each tale of kindness is short enough that you can easily pick-up and put-down this book.  Right now, this is crucial as many of us find reading in long stretches tough because our brains are fried from supporting our kids and otherwise working on our way through these odd days.  This means that each brief, uplifting story is a gift; all the more so because there is no penalty for waiting a bit before you read the next one.",5,0,1691,0.132,0

What I love about Jen is she doesn’t tell you how or what to believe.  She recognizes that every person’s journey with God is their own.  Her compassionate and brave heart challenges us to step out in faith trusting the unique gifts that we have and embracing our humanity.  She encourages us to seek peace with the woman we were created to be and to stop fighting against that to fill shoes we were never meant to fill.  As always, Jen brings insight, challenge and a deep desire to press into God to further discover all I was created to be.

1111,"This book is like Gossip Girl meets Veronica Mars meets 90210 meets all the Lifetime movies about peer pressure and social media bullying with a Revenge twist cherry on top.Seriously, there is a lot going on here! But it all flows pretty well and was interesting enough that I read the whole thing in a single night.  There doesn’t seem to be any wasted content that doesn’t, in some way, lend itself to the overall story, which I appreciate.SPOILERS!! SPOILERS!! SPOILERS!!************There were a couple of things I didn’t like:  Monica’s character arch being the first.  It’s pretty obvious throughout the story that Monica is no longer with us, but coming to find out why was just...really anticlimactic.  I was expecting something way different based on how zealously Chloe was about getting revenge for her friend, especially considering that, from my standpoint at least, the Level Ones didn’t really contribute to Monica’s situation as much as we’re led to believe.  Like, okay, they dared her, but it is made explicitly clear that she wasn’t being forced or peer pressured to act the way she did or make the decision she did *at all*  — if anything, it’s more like a cautionary tale on the dangers of over intoxication rather than bullying, because Will and Lola and Chloe, as well as video evidence, make it pretty clear that Monica was just kind of a brat with delusions of grandeur and a rich kid’s spoiled mentality.  So that being said, the whole plot kind of falls apart for me.Which brings me to the next thing I didn’t like:  Chloe!  I know, “how can you not like the main character?!?!”  But, yeah, I would not be friends with Chloe.  She was a hypocrite throughout most of the book, which she does acknowledge and so is thus slightly redeemed, but because the plot doesn’t make sense to me, none of her actions make much sense to me, either.  I don’t understand why someone would so vehemently try and get revenge for a friend who you a) admit wasn’t really your best friend anymore, and b) who was responsible for their own demise.  It’s like Chloe focused all of her anger about Monica onto these mean kids at her school who were just convenient scape goats.  Plus, she was kind of wishy-washy.  Always flip flopping on whether to take down Will or not.  I understand everyone grieves in their own way but most of the time she just seemed like an angry kid who was honestly too smart for her own good.What I did like about this book:  Chloe is fully aware of her faults.  I can appreciate that in a character even if I don’t like them.  I liked the pacing in the book, too.  There was only one part that felt unnecessary to me, but even that ended up playing a part in things.  I also liked that reading this felt like seeing Gossip girl or Veronica Mars again for the first time.  There were quite a few parts where I thought, “wow, I swear this is something ripped from a tv show” but not in a bad way.  The outer relationship dynamics really rang of Gossip girl for me, while the inner relationship dynamics were more like 90210, and the relationship between Chloe and Will was very Veronica and Logan. I feel like Chloe’s anger was very Revenge, too.  Since those are all tv shows I enjoyed, I’m not complaining!Overall, it was a decent read.  I gave it four stars because I didn’t hate it.  I don’t know if I’ll ever read it again, but it was a nice summer read.",4,0,3388,0.213,0

Her determination to lose the weight and keep it off proves she has a deep understanding of her ""why"" no matter how many ups and downs she had.  This book is amazing!

1115,"Whether you think she's a kook or a whistleblower, Judy Mikovits' book is an interesting read that will definitely raise some questions in your mind about the validity of research and the power of government and the pharmaceutical industry to bend reality to their benefit.  Mikovits comes across as an anti-vaccination person, although she claims she is not.  She does not, however, say which vaccines she feels are safe.  She raises some very serious allegations about how vaccines are created in the lab, though, and concerns about animal viruses being transmitted to humans by virtue of how vaccines are manufactured.  She also raises serious concerns about how far the government and powerful companies will go to silence those who speak out against them.My biggest complaint with this book is it is written very poorly.  The story line is disjointed and, at times, difficult to follow.  I am a physician and understand the medical jargon, but a lay person would have great difficulty wading through all of the technical information presented that really should be conveyed in simpler terms for public consumption.  The first 30 pages of this book are pretty exciting where Mikovits describes what appears to be stalking and a possible kidnap attempt on her life.  But the rest of the book takes off on a tangent, slows to a rather boring pace, and never picks up where the initial 30 pages of excitement left off.  She spends a lot of time writing about her accomplishments and why she believes she is being silenced.  She has nothing good to say about Dr. Anthony Fauci but spends no time explaining why.  When I first bought this book, I really wanted to believe this woman.  I heard her interviewed online, and what she had to say sounded pretty terrifying.  After reading the book, though, it raises questions in my mind as to whether or not she's truly a whistleblower whose career has been thoroughly destroyed by powerful interests or merely a malcontent who thinks her beliefs should be taken more seriously.Overall, I found this an interesting book to read.  It raises some very serious questions about vaccine safety.  But it really left a lot of information hanging without much explanation.  It had the potential to be a real blockbuster with better writing.  Quite honestly, the best part of the book is the rather lengthy forward written by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. which is written exceptionally well.",3,3,2420,0.155,1

I have a liturgical calendar on the wall that lists major and minor saints for every day of the year.  Sometimes, I wonder who those people are, but I'm usually too lazy or too rushed or both to take time to look up the details about their lives.This book gives me all the information that I want in small but colorful descriptions, based on the Saints' feast day.  Each day, I get a handful of history of my Faith and of my Church.  If I want more information, I can certainly research some (as I've done many times), but in one sitting, I gain more knowledge of Saints than I have in my entire life.Also, each day ends with a very brief and related prayer to each Saint that has been presented.What a great gift this book is!",5,0,829,0.182,1

Jana DeLeon has created the characters in her Miss Fortune series to surpass any others in her comedic/mystery genre.  Start with the very first book and I dare you not to get the  rest of them.  From Fortune Redding (former CIA assassin in hiding) to Ida Belle and Gertie (former ??? who don't talk about what they used to do) to Deputy Sheriff Carter LeBlanc (who just can't keep them out of law enforcement business) to the host of other characters who live in Sinful, Louisiana - DeLeon makes you want to put your house up for sale, be their friend and cohort in crime-solving.

The beginning chapters that cover what you need in your pantry, the equipment you need and the pans and baking sheets that are important to the average baker, were well written and illustrated.  The chapters are very organized.  The only problem I had was the ingredient list was run together and the measurements were in metric first with English measurements following.  I'm thinking the print copy of the book will be better formatted as I looked at an Advanced Electronic copy.

But nothing he says in this book is wrong, and I hope the fact that his thinly veiled frustration with irrational thinking doesn’t repel the casual reader who might be interested in learning ways to improve their decision-making.Unlike a lot of books written by sports journalists, there is no filler in this book added to pad the novel’s page count.  He makes his points concisely and moves on, and unless you’re an academic who’s read many of the published works on psychology that he references, you’ll definitely learn something new about the way you think.

1123,"In A BAD DAY FOR SUNSHINE, by Darynda Jones, Sunshine Vicram has recently relocated to Del Sol, New Mexico, where she grew up.  Her parents orchestrated the election for sheriff and Sunshine won, to her surprise.  On Sunshine's first day there is missing children, a prison escapee on the loose, a police lieutenant nowhere to be found, and her daughter is drowning in drama at her first day at her new school.  Can Sunshine solve all the problems surrounding her, or will she be overwhelmed and throw in the towel on her first day?  Jones has a knack for witty banter and a general ease in her style of writing.  The characters all seem very real and relatable.  Jones spends, as she should, a good deal of time on the relationship between Sunshine and her daughter, Auri.  Their connection is clearly strong, unique, and special only to them.  As the novel progresses, there are several subplots introduced and some that seem to have no bearing on the rest of the story.  I think the idea was to portray Sunshine as a strong, intelligent person that can handle many things at one and succeed at them all, but the reader at times has a hard time not only keeping up with it all, but also emotionally investing in so many different people and situations.  The book does have an exciting ending and some satisfying reveals, along with just enough things unresolved for the reader to read the next book in the series.  Quirky, sexy, and fun are words I would use to describe A BAD DAY FOR SUNSHINE.  A nice beginning for a series of books that show lots of promise.

1127,"This is an essential book for any person interested in serious mental illness, especially schizophrenia.  It deals with the impact of mental illness on families while also tracing the historical beliefs and research about schizophrenia.The book focuses on the Galvin family, an educated middle class family with 12 children - 10 boys and 2 girls.  The amazing thing about this family is that 6 of the boys have been diagnosed with schizophrenia.  The family's history and dynamics are carefully examined as they try to keep their heads above water with so much to deal with.Don, the father, is in the Air Force and keeps moving up the ranks, leaving little time for him to help with the children and also requiring the family to move frequently. Mimi, the mother, likes things just so and wants to project the perfect family to the outside world.  In truth, Mimi's best defense is denial, pretending that things are okay or just a little problematic.Chapters alternate between those about the Galvin family and chapters about the history of mental illness, ideas about its origins, and research into its causes and treatments.  As a clinical social worker with a specialty in serious mental illness, I was very impressed with the way belief systems about mental illness were approached.  This book covered everything I could think of and, since the Galvin family is a post WWII family, Mimi was blamed as a schizophrenogenic mother, a refrigerator mother, and the all-around cause for her children's mental illness.  Her opinions were negated in hospitals and she was treated disdainfully by the system.This book does not make light of the revolving door of the mental health institution.  Despite all the progress made over the last century, there is still no firm answer to the causation of schizophrenia.  The mentally ill end up in and out of psychiatric hospitals over and over again. The most popular belief seems to be the diathesis-stressor theory, a belief that one is genetically prone to schizophrenia and if a traumatic event occurs, it causes the disease to become symptomatic.Robert Kolker takes a serious and dense subject and makes it readable and fascinating.  I couldn't wait to return to this book.  It was not a fast read but it was always interesting, intense, and fascinating.  I recommend it to anyone who is interested in the topic or has a family member or close friend struggling with mental illness.",5,0,2426,0.114,0

Lo and behold was a recipe for Jewish Brisket.  Perfect.  On came the video, and there he was with a big welcoming smile on his face, promising ME that I’m gonna love his Brisket, then he goes about showing you just  how easy it is for you to make in your own  pressure cooker.  Step by step by step, with his funny and clever asides along with his helpful hints, along with perfect shots of every item, how the meat should look when it goes into the IP, the cut-up onions, etc.., as he continues showing the process from beginning to end.  But I didn’t want it to end.  He was such a delight to watch that I watched several more of his pressure cooking videos that night.  I made his Brisket the next day.  Honestly, it was at least as good as made by my favorite Jewish Deli, Chompie’s, here in Scottsdale, AZ.And Jeffrey essentially wrote his cookbook the same way he does his videos.  Step by step by step.  All the photos are wonderful, about 750 in all.  Yes, each step is photographed in a perfect small square and the finished product, a much larger photo, shows just how all your work will look on the plate, or in the bowl, etc.  So kudos to Mr. Zozulya, for his wonderful photography.  For each of his recipes, Jeffrey first includes some clever remarks  like, “When fall runs around, so does college football, and the only thing getting in between my partner, Richard, and the colors orange and blue and a pigskin is this Beer Cheese Soup.  The hot pretzel to dip in it is a touchdown in itself.”  Now wouldn’t that make you want to try that recipe?  I certainly will do just that  come the fall ‘cause Mr. Zozulya’s photo of the finished product will make you want to make it too!I read half the recipes last night into the wee hours.  Couldn’t put it down.  Enjoyed every minute of it while chuckling over his clever and delightful commentary about each recipe.  He’s quite The Entertainer, just like he is on his marvelous YouTube cooking videos.One last thing, whoever manufactures the Instant Pot owes him big time.  Their corporate office should put a full-size statue of Jeffrey in front of their entrance for everyone to see.  Why?  If the cookbook is properly advertised, they’ll sell millions more of its IPs.  And if it isn’t in Costco yet. they’re making a huge mistake, as most cookbook owners like to touch/peruse such books before they buy.Everything about this cookbook is PURE PERFECTION.

Chervinsky uses interesting correspondence and stories to show Washington as human and how skilled he was dealing with different personalities.

To think that women are now being directly targeted by the porn industry is insidious.

1133,"While I generally tend to enjoy various works of fiction, I felt the only thing missing from this novel was a stale bag of pop corn picked up as I entered my way into a dingy Indy movie theater for a lengthy afternoon of hip dialogue shot from hand held camera angels. Which is actually rather fitting considering the main character, Sarah, is a two-time once celebrated film maker herself who longs to distance herself from her second attempt and has such a poor overall self-image/confidence that I had an urge to start counting how many times she uttered the words, “I’m sorry”.  Honestly, I felt the need to either send her to her room or open a penny jar as punishment for her multiple apologies for the slightest infractions.  These seemed to occur upon embarking on a weekend trip she and her husband Matthew took after suddenly rekindling a friendship upon a hastily extended invitation to visit former good neighbors Kiki and Armand who have a young baby Sylvia.  The two families had once been so close they shared in the early childhood of Sarah and Matthew’s daughter Leda, whose history is hidden seemingly due to embarrassment on Sarah’s part.  Dialogue between the couples and various characters who enter into their weekend together - as well as an event preceding their departure - comes across in a way I can only describe as scripted art nouveau.  I honestly came away without glimpse into the characters, perhaps best described by a word casually and unapologetically used by one of the friends to describe the other upon their reacquainting - misanthropes.",2,0,1577,0.135,0

Not being afraid to be real.  That is what Cathy Guisewhite is, and that's what her book is about.  It's a sometimes humorous, sometimes ouchy expose as to what was going on behind the scenes during the Cathy years, and where Guisewhite has traveled through life since.  We are an audience to hilarious exchanges with her parents, and the difficult years of raising a teen and dealing with an empty nest, as well as in the dressing room with jeans or sport bras or bathing suits - AACK!

I thought it might be her last so I was pleasantly surprised to read a (very favorable) Washington Post review recently of Jiles’ latest, “Simon the Fiddler”.  I ordered it straight away and began reading it minutes later.  It turned out to be a huge disappointment.  Slow, no tension, no romance, it just dragged on and on.  I read only small chunks at a time, and occasionally there were three to four day periods where I didn’t pick it up at all.  None of the characters are the least bit interesting, nor is a major theme of the book, music and music instruments of the 1860s.  ZZZZZZZZ.  This is probably a one star effort – I just don’t get the 5 star reviews from some other readers – but out of respect for Jiles’ other work….2 stars.",2,0,818,0.115,1
1137,"One of the best books I have ever listened to.  The story of Cairo as told through the eyes of Will Chesney is a fitting tribute to a little known American hero.  A revealing look into the hearts of both Will and Cairo.  Naturally, the story is full of drama and excitement but it’s also full of moments that will make you laugh out loud and bring you to tears.  The audio book was read by the author and through his calm voice and slight Texas accent you really get a feel for their story.  However, it is the subtle emotion in his voice that tells the story words cannot.  Events  that may have seemed to be less emotional were sometimes very emotional and the ones that were dramatic were, well, raw.  This was one of the best audio books I have ever listened to and I highly recommend it.",5,0,792,0.176,1

The writer is very skilled, and the book moves along at a fast pace, never dragging.  I learned so much, but mostly, as a mother, I learned it's okay to not be perfect--that you can be ""good enough,"" as long as you are trying to be loving, to both your children and yourself.  I really loved all of the science in this book and how it's interwoven with biography and memoir.  The author leads the reader on an epic deep dive into the science of attachment (not the Sears kind), and I simply loved learning about Mary Ainsworth, a woman I'd never heard of, who deserves so much more recognition.  I found the mix of memoir, science, research, history, and biography to be astonishing.  Highly recommend.",5,0,823,0.192,1
1139,"For many readers both young and older adults, there is limited appreciation of what it meant to live under Apartheid.  Without diminishing the pain and injustice of growing up in such a legal system of discrimination, Trevor Noah tells his story with humor, insight and a not too subtle criticism of state sanctioned inequality. The title, ""Born a Crime"", sums up the reality of life for a child born to a Xosha mother and European father; a life that could have crushed his spirit but was channeled into becoming a solid human being.  His mother was a strong, faith filled, independent woman determined that her son would not bear the burden of the ""black tax"".  She instilled in him a sense of pride, responsibility and respect for himself and others...even when those others lacked a reciprocal respect.  Wanting him to make the most of his potential, she taught him how to work with and around the system to create doors through which to walk.  Noah's love for his mother is deep and obvious, as is the role of family in moving us towards our goals.  The book includes an explanation of the various terms and categories, the difference between segregation/Jim Crow (separate but equal) and apartheid (separate and unequal) and the history of how this social construct grew over time.  The YA version is essentially the same as the original publication with some language modification.  Many children today are not unfamiliar with the hurdles and inconsistencies that faced Trevor.  Reading and talking about this book can help put their own lives into a more hopeful perspective.",5,0,1583,0.198,1

The book also included sauces, which are essential to impart flavor on large pieces of chicken along with a few marinades.Overall, it's a great cookbook, but I wish there were more recipes, especially in the grilling and leftover section.Thank you Storey Publishing and NetGalley for this ARC in exchange for an honest review.",4,0,863,0.147,0

1142,"Head Over Paws is the fifth title in the Rescue Me series – and this one stole my heart from the very beginning… especially as we get several points of view in this story – including one amazing dog’s, Morgan.While Olivia can’t have her own dog that doesn’t stop her from lavishing all her love on the pups at a shelter she volunteers at.  Right now she’s heading out to be the driver/rescuer of dogs and cats devastated by local flooding – except maybe her car isn’t up to the very real challenge.  Fortunately, her hero, in the form of Gabe and his now-retired dog, Samson come to her rescue — and straight into each other’s hearts.I’m going to admit that I waited impatiently for Morgan’s chapters.  I did.  While I loved Olivia and Gabe who are perfect for each other once they get past the trust/risk issues, it was definitely one pup who won my heart in Head Over Paws.  If you’ve ever wondered what your dog is “really” thinking about your shenanigans then this is the perfect book for you.I had such fun with this couple as they navigate not only floodwaters but getting beyond those perceived risk factors they both have.  As always in the Rescue Me series, the animals are just (if not more) important to the overall story – and I’ve a feeling you’ll fall in love with Samson and Morgan quite easily.  I know I did.

The author does a nice job of explaining the roots of his interest in Oragami and some background of the art.  This touch is useful because as I was building models it was as if I had an instructor with me -- unlike the cold and awful instruction manuals that come with IKEA furniture.I found the models interesting, unique, and not too complicated to construct.  The bonus is that my 3-year-old grandson enjoyed playing with my creations.  I especially liked the way the book uses colors to distinguish each side of the paper, so making models was a relaxing way to pass time.

She's introverted and not an outdoor kind of girl at all.  She's assigned to monitor an unruly gang of redhead girls who ask lots of inappropriate questions.  It's all lighthearted and fun with great expressive art.  Lenoir excels at character relationships and sending up situations we've all been in before, like having to use public restrooms and showers.  About halfway through the book the story shifts to this strange supernatural mystery about two forest spirits.

I also enjoy the relationship between Winnie and her grandmother, which continues in this book.  I didn't find the mystery in this book to be as compelling as the first book's mystery.  There seemed to be a revolving door of minor characters parading through as suspects, and the reason  provided at the conclusion for the murders seemed a little far fetched.

1147,"Very well written and thoroughly exhaustive on specifics words used for the demonic forces in the OT.  Also extensively footnoted....extensively.  By that I mean roughly 1/3 of the book is footnotes.  Perhaps this is more value to a student or seminarian, but I personally found the footnoting to be distracting and cumbersome.  If there is that much to footnote, weave it into the text!Clearly written, well documented, thoroughly researched but a bit too rigid for my liking.  The author clearly knows what he is writing about but sometimes overwhelms with his knowledge (not in a bad way, it seems to be his style)/So, if you want to know more about evil from an OT perspective and like word studies this is for you.

If you are a fan of these serialized ""books"", then you may not mind the need to buy several sequential installments in order to finish the story.  While there is nothing wrong with creating a series, using familiar characters in a common universe, each book should have a true ending that is more than just a transition to the next edition.Personally, I believe strongly that each book should be able to stand on its own merits.  A good writer can always find ways to create a complete story while still leaving the reader entertained, intrigued, and wanting read more stories  about the characters and the ""world"" that has been created.  This writer is either unable or unwilling to do that.",1,0,828,0.159,1

1150,"Once again, Arthur Shelton, the Duke of Macklin and the ever-present, Tom appear to be up to their matchmaking schemes in A Duke Too Far, the story of the final man at that dinner in London.  Although you might be tempted to believe this is the last story in The Way To A Lord’s Heart series, it appears there is one more book to come, Earl’s Well That Ends Well, and I’m hopeful for that story to wrap up everything quite nicely (time will tell).Ada and Peter’s story felt very much like a slow burn romance.  Peter is not only heartbroken by his sister’s death, but he’s also struggling to keep his rundown, dilapidated estate solvent… with not much luck.  He has no time nor inclination for romance or company but has been descended upon by not only Ada and her group but by the Duke of Macklin as well.  Ada was his sister’s friend, and she’s convinced that she has a vital clue in the documents that she hand-delivers to Peter that could change his estate’s future – and an attraction to the man who always seems lost in thought and standoffish to the world.A Duke Too Far is not only a romance, but a bit of a treasure hunt as well as Ada, Peter, and Ada’s friends set out to find a hidden treasure that has always seemed more fantasy and legend than a possibility to Peter.

1151,"Asking for Trouble is the third title in the Credence, Colorado series, and this one is full of laughs, some unintentional since I often laughed at Tucker’s response to Della’s shenanigans.  It’s also full of growing, trusting, and living life once again as Della steps beyond the initial healing of leaving her abusive marriage behind and starts to look to her own future happiness.  It’s such a combination of amusing, sadness, learning to spread hesitant wings, and falling in love with the good guy, the kind of guy Della needed in her life.  Watching Tucker slowly go beyond she’s a fragile piece of glass or she’s his best friend’s sister to allowing his feelings for this amazingly brave woman to show through all the rest was pure joy for me.  And frankly, if I wasn’t already a bit in love with Tucker myself – the puppy would have been the final touch.With a secondary cast of characters to make you swoon or laugh out loud (or in my case, giggle-snort at some erm… mature ladies), Asking for Trouble was an emotional story with a real-life feel when needed most, and a fun sexy romantic comedy at other times.  It’s hard to put this one in any particular trope for there are actually several here so I stopped trying and simply enjoyed a really good story about two people falling in love and getting beyond the past and on to their future.  I’ve enjoyed this series so much and I’m definitely waiting for the next release, it can’t come soon enough for me.*I received an e-ARC of this novel from Entangled Publishing via NetGalley.

I'm crazy about this book because there are so many great ideas.  I love how there is a general framework of thinking like  a lawyer and examples on how to actually practice this in your classroom.  One of our units this year is controversial issues and this book will beautifully supplement our materials by helping me help my students learn HOW to think not WHAT to think.Another point in the book is particularly important in this era we are in right now of protests and Covid:  it is better to DO right than to BE right.

It wasn't just facts, it was discovering answers through love, trial and error, sometimes disappointment but no one gave up.

I recommended it to many students at the middle school where I am the librarian, and everyone who read it gave it rave reviews.  I had such high expectations for his new book and I was not disappointed.  Torrey gets kids.  He gets how they interact, what they say, and what they think.  His character development is ON POINT, and the decisions that kids are faced with in the novel are real and the way they navigate these decisions is incredibly believable.  There is so much to discuss and think about in this tight little novel. As Stephen starts to see the way he is treated differently from his white friends and the way the world sees him as a young black man coming of age, he realizes who his real friends are and what the world is really like.- a sobering realization that he does not take likely, but faces with courage.  I cannot recommend this book highly enough to both kids and adults.  Kids will see themselves in Stephen no matter what their background, and will learn about themselves and the world they live in and have more empathy as a result.  Additionally, this book and his novel before this, Tight are a great hook for kids who don't consider themselves readers....they are short but lack nothing, and kids feel an incredible sense of accomplishment after quickly reading an engrossing book, leaving them wanting more.

1161,"Death of an American Beauty, by Mariah Fredericks, is the third entry in a mystery series set in New York City during the very early part of the twentieth century.  It features Jane Prescott, a ladies’ maid, as the primary sleuth.  Jane is smart, responsible, complicated, and way, way ahead of her time.  She is well-positioned to observe the ways of the “upper” class for whom she works and the working class from whom she came.  In 1913, New York is inundated with change of all sorts.  Immigration is surging.  Manufacturing and the emergence of the department store is changing women’s fashions as well as women’s purchasing power.  For better and worse, poor women have new employment possibilities.Fredericks is a master of bringing these details to life as she vividly depicts the gritty streets of the poor and the opulent offices of the princes of industry and trade.  She is equally adept at depicting the social, economic, racial and gender inequities of the time.  Unfortunately, neither her characters (with the exception of Jane) nor the mystery they are attempting to resolve rise to the level of the rich backdrop the author has created.  The characters seem wooden and dimensionless.  The plot and mystery seem contrived.I would read these books for the history.  Where else can you read how the bra was invented and imagine the impact this had on a woman’s daily life?

I spent the better part of a year recommending that book and then eagerly awaiting Sloan's story when I saw through social media that she would get her turn to shine in The Happy Ever After Playlist.  Part of me was nervous that this second book wouldn't live up to my expectations because I had loved TFZ so very much...  I have no idea why I ever had a doubt in my mind about HEAP!Abby Jiminez has a voice.  A clear, poignant voice who can find sorrow within laughter and joy in the most difficult of moments.  She knows exactly when to pepper a scene with a pop culture reference, she gives human-like personality to the animals in her stories and she will make you laugh and cry within the span of reading a single sentence.  Most importantly of all, she takes real life dilemmas and turns them on her head in a way that gives this genre a very refreshing change of pace.  There is absolutely no formula in her writing, but there is brilliance in every single line.My only complaint is that I devour her novels so quickly that it's almost physically painful to wait for the next story she's able to share!If you haven't read The Friend Zone already, go out and get it.

1165,"Well written and a lot of research done on the subject.Personally, and I like to have a lot of detail information but  I found some of all the background information to be a bit overwhelming to the point of remembering  who is who became a bit of a job.  I did learn a lot of new information that I was not aware off.  The relationship between the Earp Brothers and their wives (I should say common law wives).  The politics that went on in that time.  This book shows clearly that the Earp Brothers were not always the good guys even if their intent was mostly good.  In the early days of Tombstone there really was a very narrow line between  the two sides.  If you are interested in that time period of American history and want to learn more I definitely think you will enjoy this book.",4,0,790,0.131,1
1166,"Fans of the legal novel should definitely pick this one up even if they haven't read the earlier books in the series.  Rachel Gold has a lot on her plate (son, mother, dating) outside work- where there's much going on as well.  She's got a great partner in Jacki and friend in Benni.  She's also great in the courtroom and in this outing she's dealing with both a libel suit and a family argument over a trust fund.  The legal ins and outs are easy to follow, the various players both rotten and nice (but keep an open mind), and the mysteries (such as they are) just complex enough to keep you guessing.  This is a more accessible read for non-lawyers than Kahn's last (which focused on the dreaded rule against perpetuities) but it never dumbs down the legal issue.  Thanks to Netgalley for the ARC.  Excellent read.",5,0,818,0.217,0
1167,"I received a free electronic copy of this excellent novel from Netgalley, Julia Spencer-Fleming, and Monitor Books.  Thank you all for sharing your hard work with me.  I have read this novel of my own volition, and this review reflects my honest opinion of this work.  I am happy to see this return to the story of Clare Fergusson, Episcopalian priest, and Russ Van Alstyne, Chief of Police of Millers Kill, a very small town in the scarcely populated county of Washington in New York state.We have three distinct timelines - August 1952, August 1972, and August of the present-day.  These time frames all have several things in common - the yearly circus/carnival of the county, the various generations of several prominent local families, autumn folding color over the lovely Adirondack mountains - and the deaths of lovely young women found in new party frocks laying in the middle of McEachron Hill Road without shoes, purse, stockings or obvious cause of death.  The current chief of police, Russell Van Alstyne, was 20, just returning from a second tour in Vietnam and considered a potential perpetrator of the second murder in 1972.  The murders are all very similar but there are 70 years between first and last so maybe copycat but probably not one single perpetrator.  There are only one or two people who even remember the 1952 death, which at the time was not considered murder but rather an unexplained death. Hid from Our Eyes is an exciting who-done-it, with interesting protagonists and a compelling pace.  If you are new to this author, she has some excellent books already out there, and just as timely today as they were when newly released.",5,0,1660,0.124,0
1168,"I just didn’t connect with the recipes in this cookbook.  Perhaps our family isn’t as strict about Paleo dieting as the author, but too many recipes call for ingredients I don’t generally stock or feel are necessary to enjoy a simple Paleo diet (almond/coconut flour, arrowroot powder, coconut aminos, etc).  It also seems like every other recipe calls for erythritol, maple syrup or honey—just not combinations I’d put in dishes, particularly meat ones.  The vegetable mains are a bit disappointing as well—very little in the way of seasonings to make the recipes flavorful or different.There are a few worthwhile remakes that our family does enjoy, like the sesame chicken.

1169,I liked the book and have recommended it to others as a starting point for looking at various investing strategies and why dividend growth investing remains a solid choice.  I appreciate how the author takes the reader through various other approaches only to come back to dividend growth investing and why this approach is not a consolation prize approach but instead superior to so many other strategies.  I am well versed and trained in many investing strategies and yet dividend growth investing is what I now rely on to live financially free with the most simplistic approach.  Appreciation of the principles are key to DGI so understanding why this works is essential to being able to stick with it through bull and bear markets knowing your dividend income continues to rise.,5,0,782,0.209,0

1172,"Wanted .....  Ethical cop in a foreign milieu who in the face of pervasive adversity maintains his scruples .  Ever since the sorrowful passing of Philip Kerr there has been a gaping hole in my crime fiction enjoyment ....  I needed a replacement for the World War II exploits of Bernie Gunther.  And, along comes Deon Meyer's "" The Last Hunt "" featuring the impressive duo of Captain Benny Griessel and Vaughn Cupido, members of the Serious and Violent Crimes Unit ...  an elite force better known as the ""Hawks"".  This is my first foray into the oeuvre of Meyer and the eighth entry into his series featuring the South African Police Service (SAPS).  Simmering in the background are the implications of trying to police effectively in post-Apartheid South Africa.  The freedom ""Struggle"" of this nation eventually culminated in the first democratic, and multi-racial election in April 1994.  The Anti-Apartheid cause was locked into devastating conflicts ...  this social movement entailed not only passive resistance but at times guerrilla warfare.  The consequences leak into the forces and motivation of this convoluted tale.  Three storylines are told in juxtaposition..  seemingly unrelated, but eventually intersecting into an explosive and powerful denouement .  Griessel and Cupido are assigned a cold case that was botched by the local police. They are tasked with the investigation of a possible murder of an ex-cop Johnson Johnson.  Possibly murdered on the luxurious Rovos Train, running from Cape Town to Pretoria and tossed out and found trackside , With an investigation ensuing of 65 passengers, reminiscent  of ""Murder on the Orient Express"".  Eventually they discover Johnson was stabbed in back of the neck with an Okapi knife (deemed "" A Saturday Night Special"") and then thrown off the train.  Paralleling this investigation, is the questionable suicide of Menzi Dekela in his kitchen ...  called into question is his motivation considering his past as one of sixteen old fighters, former senior fighures in the Struggle. ....  Is the note authentic or forged ? ...  Where is the shell casing? ......  And thirdly, we find Daniel Darret living an anonymous sedate life under an assumed name in Bordeaux, France.  Once known as Thobela Mpayipheli, an accomplished sniper who earned his bones long ago , as a young participant in The Struggle. He's approached by a dear old friend, Lonnie May, and entreated to enter the fray one more time and strike a blow for South Africa.  A turbulent political scene still exists in South Africa. ....  leaked to the media is the suspicion that the state government is ""captured"" ... incriminating the president of the country and half of his cabinet ...  completely controlled and following the interest of three Indian billionaire  businessmen.  In the face of present day corruption the story unfolds. Meyer's narrative seamlessly flows through the eyes of multiple flawed but unforgettable characters.

1174,"In The Ordinary Way: A Unique Way to Live, Pastor Mark T. Goodman discloses to his reader the treasure and import of the ""ordinary.""  In Christian thought, rooted in the liturgical traditions of both the Eastern and Western Churches, mystics, scholars, theologians, and ""ordinary people"" have worshiped and celebrated through the centuries, ""ordinary"" time.  For those Christians unfamiliar with this construct of time, ""ordinary"" are those two periods between Christmas and Lent, and Easter and Advent.  While the two seasons of Lent and Advent resonate with celebration of events in the life of Jesus, ""ordinary"" times focus upon the ministry and teachings of Christ.  Goodman, in his inimitable style and forthright, articulate presentation, guides his reader to do exactly what the Church has done throughout its history during ""ordinary"" times, i.e. to concentrate upon the ministry and teachings of Jesus Christ, and to learn to revel and find joy in them.  Likening our lives to the ministry and teachings of Christ, the author refuses to yield to the temptation of living only and energetically in the extraordinary seasons, but to find the richness, joy, and value of life between the punctuation.I have known Mark Goodman for many years, and have deep respect, admiration, and love for this tremendous man of God.  His writing reflects his life and his calling.  In The Ordinary Way: A Unique Way to Live, readers unfamiliar with Goodman will come to know the wisdom and practical scholarship of a man dedicated to the Lord, His church, and the Kingdom of God.

The explanations of ""current events"" across the US just before the Civil War broke out, as Lincoln's journey to Washington was taking place, were interesting and informative.  The repetitive discussions of largely similar individual legs of a journey to Washington were very tiresome.  Boarding the train at each stop, interactions with passengers, the content and duration of dozens of the speeches he made upon arrivals and departures, the descriptions of the trains and the hotels, how people described Lincoln's appearance, etc., etc.  It was all too much of the same thing over and over.

Carrie and Colin were not only unlikeable, but their story was repetitious, no character growth; the explanation for the nameless child's end result was not believable either.

1188,"I was hoping for more details on the mechanics of spying and surveillance, rather than a history of how spying and surveillance has been used, which caused me to be rather disappointed with this book.  But it is what it is.This gives the history of spying and surveillance in the United States, but with a strong pro-privacy perspective.  As I have said many times in my reviews of material, having a strong opinion (even if I don't agree with it) is fine, so long as the text offers arguments and recognizes nuance.  This book does offer some nuance, but overall,  it presents the side that surveillance and spying are bad, and that we need to make privacy a bigger concern.It starts with the Trojan Horse (making parallels to the ancient story and today's malware), has a section on the Bible and how God is like an all-seeing surveillant and how this may have affected society's thoughts on surveillance (?). (It's not very clear to me how this particular section really adds to the discussion as it is never really explored).  Then some Foucault and the Panopticon discussion.  Then it does get to the history of the US.  This part is better, though it is rather selective in what presents.  It shows how Hoover and the FBI spied on Americans without much cause, how other spy agencies have conducted some surveillance on Americans domestically, and talks about the post 9/11 security situation.Without citations, it is difficult to evaluate the historical arguments' accuracy.  There is also little discussion in the book of what a proper amount of privacy protection is.  Many of the things decried in the book (surveillance of social media, CCTV in public, public protests) are of things that already occur in public.  Is it unreasonable to expect your public actions to be kept private? It seems to me that things that you make public are not obviously unacceptable for surveillance.  There are certainly questions of who gets to use the information, but that seems like a separate question from whether such public data can be recorded in the first place. The book also calls Edward Snowden a whistleblower.  My understanding is that many disagree with this use of the term because Snowden revealed secrets without going through the actual whistleblowing procedure the government has, and then fled rather than face the consequences of his actions (the book sort of acknowledges this by quoting former President Obama).  The book also is very dismissive of the potential uses of such information in stopping crime or terrorism.  I am not as certain this is true, as it would be counterintuitive, at the very least. There do need to be boundaries, but I felt like this topic was not really explored.Overall, while I like the graphical comic aspect, I would like there to be some sort of scholarly citation backing up the statements in the book at the end of the book or elsewhere.  The history is more about how surveillance and spying has been used than on the actual mechanics of doing so, and the book takes a very strong pro-privacy/anti-surveillance stance.  The lack of citations is what lowers the rating from 4 to 3 stars for me because the authors take a strong stance, and so I would like to see their historical sources.",3,0,3239,0.108,0

This is not a book to read if you're looking for depth or ingenuity - but it serves up a nice dose of lighthearted and extremely readable fun.  Definitely a go to book for when you want something that's not too heavy or deep.  I really enjoyed this novel and would definitely recommend it.",4,0,819,0.335,0
1196,"There are no words that can adequately describe how beautiful this cookbook is.  Not just because it has stunning photographs or because of the exquisitely written recipes (which are top notch - I've already made several!), but because from her first book to her second book you can see and evolution of a woman who is becoming more and more of herself everyday.  From a balanced human she has become simply human, and I cannot wait to see what is in store for her next book.  But for now I will savor all the goodies in this one!  P.S. the way she writes her recipes is genius and also, very incredible for those of us who lack her culinary prowess.  She takes everything down to a level at which if you knew nothing about cooking you would need to know in order to execute the recipe properly.",5,0,795,0.042,0
1197,"I am an avid reader of David Baldacci's novels, and I think of all of his characters Amos Decker has become my favorite.  A really interesting premise as to how he became who he is, and his character continues to be given more depth as each novel rolls out.  This was a really good read, very interesting premise and hard to put down.  I do think that maybe he tried to roll complex multiple plot lines together where i don't think the second plot line added much, and that's the only reason this only got four stars from me.  I think he needs to develop the Jamison character better...not much to her and you don't get a sense as to what makes her tick.  She's very one dimensional.  Overall though this is the usual entertaining read, and great escape given the times we're facing right now.",4,0,793,0.164,0
1198,"This book Empires of the Sky by Alexander Rose is a thick book of 455 pages that tells the in- depth story of air travel.  From the beginning of inspirations and designs of men to fly like the birds by German Count Von Zeppelin and the American Wright Brother Orville and Wilbur.  It does go into the daily lives and dreams of these men.  Zeppelin had the dream of using this machine in the war which he did for World War I in Germany.This book covers the flight of air travel through Count Von Zeppelin and his dreams of conquering the air.  It covers all the background of his life and his associates in the development of an air ship including the use of hydrogen or helium to keep the air ship afloat.  It covers all the mistakes and crashes before it became a wonder of the world in the 1930’s.The Wright Brothers air ship became popular as they became show people in doing acrobat flying in air show in America and France.  These airplanes soon became popular and business men such as Juan Terry Trippe who developed air travel that grew into Pan America Air Lines in America.  Air plane travel became an air business as a distraction of the Zeppelin’s crossing the ocean. The story of the Hindenberg disaster led to the destruction of Air ShipsIf you enjoy detail writings this book is for you, it details the history of the flying machines.

It takes so long to get up and get moving; it wanders without the usual Grisham excellence until it finally gets on to the true plot line.  The first 50% or so is pablum, difficult, but you stay with it because it's Grisham.  He eventually brings it around to make sure that justice is done--he is a master at that part, rendering justice to those who deserve it.  We finally understand that there are some bad guys, they've done a massive fraud, and they get what they're supposed to get:  justice, Grisham style.  He's a master of the legal thriller, and everything he gives us is precious on some level, this one a little less than normal.",4,0,820,0.22,0
1200,"After reading The Right Swipe last year, I was very excited to read Rai’s newest book, Girl Gone Viral.  I thoroughly enjoyed this adorable contemporary romance!{Thank you so much to Avon Romance and Netgalley for the gifted copy in exchange for my honest review!}This is the second book in Rai’s Modern Love series, but each book in the series can easily be read as a standalone book.  Each book focuses on the story and development of specific characters, but all of the characters are present.  Girl Gone Viral is definitely my favorite in the series so far! Katrina and Jas stole my heart!Katrina is an extremely wealthy former model who suffers from anxiety and who values her privacy so much in this digital age.  After sharing a table with a handsome man at a local cafe, Katrina finds herself going viral on social media as #cutecafegirl in a fake meet-cute story.  To keep Katrina out of the spotlight, her bodyguard and friend Jas takes her away to his family farm.  Katrina and Jas can finally come face-to-face with their suppressed feelings for each other.I will always have a thing for bodyguard/protector storylines in romance.  It’s just what gets my heart fluttering, especially when it is done right and Rai nails it!  I also love that Katrina and Jas suffer from anxiety and PTSD.  These are very prevalent issues and were handled beautifully.  I do feel like the character development, especially at the end, could have been better but that is my only small complaint.If you have not read this series yet, definitely put it on your list!  I can’t wait for the next one!4/5 stars!",4,0,1599,0.218,0

This particular book has small type with almost no margins, odd-looking chapter headings, and a very cheap, amateur look, like something I would type and print from my home computer.  Also, the summary on the back is not accurate.  Finally, there is a strange ""warning"" by Wilder Publications about how values were different when this book was written and advising parents to discuss how views have changed on ""race, gender, sexuality, ethnicity, and interpersonal relations"" with their children before allowing them to read the book.  This seems to be sending the message that traditional values are inferior to today's standards.  Nothing could be further from the truth!",3,0,801,0.128,1

She decides she needs to get out of her house and runs into some neighbors.  Then she runs into them again.  And somehow, against all odds, she develops friendships, and ends up with a dog.  And her life starts to change.  This book brought me to tears.  It's just a beautiful story of life and relationships and how our own burdens can affect everything around us.  It was a little slow for a bit in the middle, but it was worth the ride and waiting it out.  I can't recommend this book enough.

Becky’s engaging writing style helped me to see how to grow my prayer life and to set aside time for going to my “inner chapel”.  As I worked through the prayer exercises at the end of each chapter, I found myself thinking about where I have been in my life with Christ as well as where I want to go.  She pushed me to go deeper and challenged me to trust Jesus to have the answers.  Giving up control is never easy for me.  This book helped me to contemplate what my life could be like as I learn to trust that He has a bigger plan!  It is also a great introduction to Ignatian Spirituality.

1204,"In 1827, the primary architect of what would become the Democratic Party, Martin Van Buren, wrote that he intended to unite the ""plain republicans of the north"" and the ""planters of the south"" in a coalition that would resurrect Jeffersonian ideals and get Andrew Jackson elected president.  Michael E. Wood's magnificent new book shows how Van Buren's strategy worked in practice by focusing his attention on the lives and political careers of Stephen Douglas and Jefferson Davis.  Part dual biography and part history of the antebellum Democratic Party, Woods skillfully presents Douglas and Davis as the embodiments of those ""plain republicans"" (Douglas) and the ""planters"" (Davis) who shaped the development--and, ultimately, by 1860, the destruction--of the party Van Buren had launched decades earlier.  Ultimately, the tension inherent in the coalition, best represented by Douglas's commitment to majoritarian rule and Davis's determination to preserve the property rights of southern slaveholders, doomed the Union and forced a realignment in the party.Woods has crafted an impressively researched (it seems he has read everything relevant to his topic) and elegantly written book that is notable for its original insights.  The pace never flags and the amount of detail the book contains never overwhelms the reader.  Woods also has a finely honed sense of irony--and there are plenty of ironies in the history he narrates.  This is a terrific book that makes a significant contribution to our understanding of why and how the Civil War came.",5,0,1552,0.146,1
1205,"Loved this book.  It's a historical novel about the Michelin rubber plants in Indochina.  When I read historical fiction I never start googling about the era or topic until I finish the book and then it's the first thing I do.  I'm always anxious to see whether it's truly historical with fiction to enhance the story or if it is fiction in a historical setting.  For what it is worth,  I believe this is the latter although as you can tell that didn't impact my rating!  The book is a study of the times and of race but from a different perspective than other novels.  It's a great time piece, informative and filled with intrigue.

I also attended a meet and greet with several of the Texas Bluebonnet Award winning authors and Christina Uss was there!

It focuses on five chapters:  Qui-Gon Jinn, Obi-Wan, Anakin Skywalker, Padme, and Mace Windu.  I thought Qui-Gon Jinn and Anakin Skywalker's chapters get a 5/5.  They show the characters in more depth.  Anakin Skywalker's chapter, in particular, has a neat ending which would've added to his character and story if shown in the films.  I liked that there was a chapter on Padme - she seems a character no one really knows what to do with other than portray her one-dimensionally, as either very strong or very vulnerable, whereas Anakin, Obi-Wan and the others are shown with more color and humor.  This is a great comic and definitely worth it!!!",5,0,794,0.167,1

1209,"Tombstone, the city, holds a bit of magical appeal to me.  I find that I am enjoying reading history books more and more (perhaps because I've got more of it myself?) and I absolutely love the American Southwest for its landscape and history and few cities in this region have more history that Tombstone, Arizona.My knowledge of the gunfight at the OK Corral, I realize, comes from popular culture (as provided in films and television) and not from the history books, so I was very glad to correct that with Tom Clavin's book.What Clavin has done is taken the pivotal gunfight and researched the heck out of the history of all the primary, secondary, and even tertiary people involved, giving us a glimpse of the character traits of each individual (were they prone to fighting or over-reacting, were they easy to anger or did they often look for alternatives?)There are so many more people involved in the ordeal than were at the corral and there was a history among the players that weaves back and well before any of them arrived at Tombstone, Arizona. It's a complicated web and quite fascinating to discover.Clavin's research is immaculate.  It is fascinating how much of a trail we all leave and that Clavin was able to track down so much information about these people, from the 1800's, and put together a time-line of where and when people worked or met one another is absolutely incredible.  Like a lot of modern bio-history books, there is a bit of the author making assumptions about the words spoken or the intentions behind an action (usually based on general human motivations), but it was nice to read him at least once admit to not knowing why someone proceeded the way that they did, but instead offered up a couple of different possible explanations based on their history.In addition to his tremendous research, Clavin's writing style is smooth and his sense of storytelling moves this history from moment to moment with wonderful anticipation and ease.  It is easy to read this book in a short amount of time, but you might not want to so that you can really absorb all the information proved.Looking for a good book? <em>Tombstone</em>, by Tom Clavin, provides more information about the city, famous for its noted gunfight, and the people involved, than you ever imagined. This is a book not to be missed if you have even the most remote interest in history.",5,0,2381,0.125,0

This book really did help to educate me more about the keto lifestyle and why it works for so many people.I really enjoyed everything about this book and think it is a wonderful addition to any library, but particularly one for those who are striving to be health conscious.

There are many straight histories, the best of which, in my opinion, is the classic ""Kent State: What Happened and Why,"" by James Michener.This book is actually a prose poem, a sort of stream of consciousness account of an imagined conversation among students who were there, townspeople, guardsmen, etc.  It also has an ax to grind, a political bias.I have mixed feelings.  It think it's an interesting, even unique, idea.  However, I didn't care for the execution very much.

Much interesting information is provided about the selection and training of military working dogs.  Their capabilities are truly amazing.  It is a measure of the author's dedication and integrity that Cairo becomes a central focus of this book.

1222,"Dr. Chervinsky has given us another team of rivals to explain the major influences George Washington still has on the American presidency and as her reflection back to Doris Goodwin’s award-winning work on Lincoln’s leadership.  Surprisingly, this institution has had little attention. Oh, what glories for a historian to find a subject like this.The Cabinet explores the origins of an American Institution created during the fluid time of George Washington’s first administration.  The Constitution Convention’s discussions of a formal cabinet, like the British maintained, were rejected out of memories of the too recent Revolutionary War and suspicions of British institutions.  As the first President and the most respected leader from the Revolution, Washington was the only expected person to tackle the ominous task of putting life into the Constitutional language of the American presidency.  Everything he did, he knew, would become precedent.Washington did not begin his administration with a cabinet in mind, but it had been his practice from earlier military service to assemble a Council of War at which to gain group support, new ideas, or diverse opinions and expertise.  As any good leader, he selected advice and opinions from strong personalities not fearful of his reputation but men of strong ego as well.The cabinet was assembled, like his former commanding officers in the Continental Army, of secretaries of each federal department managed within the Executive Branch.  At first, the Senate was the assumed official advisors for the president, especially in foreign affairs.  This proved fruitless and Washington instead selected the Secretaries he had already chosen to discuss affairs in their departments.  This grew through each national crisis into an advisory body and support group.  This team, composed of men of very divergent opinions and large egos included Thomas Jefferson, Alexander Hamilton, Henry Knox, and Edmund Randolph.  Dr. Chervinsky demonstrates Washington’s leadership mastery through his ability to curb the arguments, and personalities of these four dominating men.  They were all members of the political elite. Each prided on previous histories with Washington and their Revolutionary credentials.Even though this fellowship did not survive the two terms it set an expected precedent that allowed later Presidents to select their own favored advisors.  It also set up the practice of powerful executives that were not dependent on the legislature but capable of creating a check to that branch.It would be a very sloppy history to move directly from Washington’s administration to current politics without fully reviewing the two centuries of change between.  This is the origins of an important American political institution most of us have watched.  The numbers are much larger, and they are no longer all men, but the egos if feel have not shrunk.",5,0,2902,0.122,0

Houses, kids, education, health care, cars, vacations, and, yes, charity all cost money, especially as one gets into one's 40's and beyond.  $40K a year is basically poverty level, but your assets would probably disqualify you for food stamps, and this sort of plan ain't gettin' you social security either.

At the end of the first day of competition, the winner fails to appear and is found dead in his competition trailer.  Soon a second man falls ill after eating tainted tacos.  Is someone trying to eliminate the competition?  Angie intends to find out without finding herself the killers next target.  Deep Fried Revenge is the fourth A Farm-to-Fork Mystery.

Angie cannot help but ask questions and dig for clues (she is naturally curious).  I liked the carnival atmosphere with the rides, exhibits and the food that will clog your arteries (but is too good to resist).  The mystery had a handful of suspects.  I wish there had been more action and sleuthing.  One detail pointed me in the direction of the killer.  The mystery did not become a priority until late in the story.  The gang was more concerned with a new arrival, Bleak.  She is a teenage runaway in need of assistance.  She provides few details about herself, but she does make it clear that she will not go back home.  Bleak gets a job at the County Seat and goes to live with the sheriff and his wife.  Bleak finds herself in a sticky situation that will need Angie and the gang to come to her rescue.  Lynn Cahoon has an engaging writing style.  It is friendly and casual which makes Deep Fried Revenge easy to read.  The story had a good flow and moved along at a steady pace.  I enjoyed joining Angie, Ian, Felicia and the group at the fair.  There is also romance in the air between Felicia and a certain sous chef.  Deep Fried Revenge is an upbeat cozy mystery with fun fair food, the darling Dom, a killer cooking competition, a worrying runaway and a crafty killer.*I voluntarily read an advanced copy of this book.

Wanting to understand Dave's journey (I'm a gay conservative now so have had my own transition over many years) I was curious to see how his transition paralleled my own.Dave shares my frustration trying to maintain friendships with liberal friends and navigating my community.  I am pretty good at defending my positions but Dave often provides additional insights as to how ""progressives"" believe what they do and how to prevent conversations from getting overheated.If you have a curious mind and are interested in others that have made a place for open conversations Dave's book is a great read.",5,0,744,0.207,1

1228,"The Genius Prince's Guide to Raising a Nation Out of Debt (Hey, How About Treason?) is a fine and witty work, always worth reading.  Prince Wein continues to be frustrated about having to give up his dream of being a decadent aristocrat with endless leisure time and settle down as a wise monarch, brave warrior and cunning politician.  This time, there is trouble with an expanding western kingdom, a powerful religious order, a conquered kingdom's resistance force, trouble with his own lords, not to mention a king who'd like to hunt Ninym for sport.  It's fun watching Wein match wits and come up with clever solutions.  Indeed, I wouldn't be surprised if a lot of readers think the country would be better off if we had people like Wein and Ninym in the White House, compared to the likely choices we'll have this November.",5,0,828,0.191,1
1229,I love returning to Storyton Hall in Virginia.  I know it will be a wonderful who-done-it and it's a chance to revisit Jane and her twin boys.  Jane has a full house with a Children's publisher hosting a conference but also the debut of the Scavenger Hunt in the Fairy Tale forest.  First Jane finds a woman dresses as little Red Riding Hood murdered in one of the exhibits.  She has a valuable copy of Grimm's Fairy tales in her basket.  When a second body is found the Fins must gear up to protect their secret library.  This is Book 6 in the Book Retreat series and it could be read as a stand alone but you'll probably want to read the previous books to understand all the characters.

1230,"I found this to be an absolutely brilliant book.  John Carey, an Oxbridge professor, is an erudite guide to learning about poems and poetry.  But, he  is not only an intelligent guide, he has written a book where I wanted to keep turning the pages.This book encompasses the history of poetry from the earliest epics, such as The Gilgamesh Epic, and moves through the centuries, ending in chapter 40 with modern poets including Maya Angelou and Mary Oliver.  I could list so many, many of the included  poets but will pick just ten to give an idea of what the book contains: Homer, Dante, Donne, Milton, Wordsworth, Eliot, Pound, Elizabeth Bishop, Auden and Stevie Smith.To give an example of the flavor of this title, chapter one is about the Gilgamesh Epic.  The story itself is clearly recounted but the author gives so much more than this; for example, there is discussion about how this story relates to other biblical tales and poetry's depictions of death as a central issue for all. This expansiveness leaves the reader with much food for thought.Professor Carey sees that music and poetry are analagous; one gives us the best of noise while the other may give us the best of words.  (This is my understanding of what he said).I recommend this book most highly.  Even before our current crisis, 2020 was becoming the year of exploring poetry for me.  This book will enhance my understanding and experience as I continue my journey..Many, many thanks to NetGalley and the publisher for this book in exchange for an honest review.

It offers a powerful message for children who experience the divorce of their parents and subsequently find themselves dividing their life between two homes with a sometimes-complicated schedule.Too often, the child may feel as though they are somehow responsible for the disruption in their family.  This book delivers a message of love and caring.  Having a list of things that will not change, when much is changing in your life, can offer a great relief and renewed sense of security in a changing world.Really excellent book; highly recommended.

1232,"Former Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull has written a long and thought provoking memoir with “A Bigger Picture”.  It’s also very well written and showcases Turnbull’s earlier experience as a journalist and lawyer.For the first 100 pages, the book races along as it covers Turnbull’s childhood as an only child brought up by a single father, his education including the awarding of a Rhodes Scholarship, his obviously very successful legal and business career and his time running the campaign for an Australian republic.  It’s a pity that Turnbull spends so little time on the first fifty years of his life.  I found his narrative here to be very interesting.The remainder of the book deals with his time in Parliament, especially his three years as Prime Minister.  Here, Turnbull had so much to offer but, only partly due to his own fault, so comparatively little was achieved.  To many Australians, he was a great disappointment.  Yet, to be fair, Turnbull had many enemies, not least his bitter and spiteful predecessor, Tony Abbott.  Despite promising to be supportive of the new Prime Minister, Abbott was nothing of the sort.  At every opportunity, he tried to bring down Turnbull and his government.  In this regard, Abbott succeeded.  However, he also succeeded in losing his own blue ribbon seat in Parliament.  At least some justice was served.“A Bigger Picture” will mainly be read by Australian Political aficionados.  This is perhaps a shame.  Turnbull writes in a very fluent style. Indeed, the book was a pleasure to read.  Recommended.",4,0,1562,0.152,0

Maybe if the author asked real people who actually  struggle with  “sympathetic flight or dorsal vagaries immobilization responses” just by imaging an action, then the book would not suggest going to a coffee shop to talk with your friends.  Really?  This is helpful information written by an expert?  Who needs an expert to suggest this sort of thing?  This book is maybe nice for people who just want to fine tune their their totally normal nervous system.  My personal reaction to this book is disappointment.

1235,"There has never been a true crime story I wasn't into until this book.  (I stopped reading in the middle of Chapter 3).  The author literally states, ""The police would say later that they were just doing their jobs that night.  But I eventually pieced together the official statements of the young people in the motel room along with details of conversations I had with several of them and the following is more like what I believe actually happened.""  Where were the statements from the police?  I didn't want to read about what the author thinks happened; I wanted to read FACTS.  One sided ""journalism"" at its best. The author then goes on to make it seem like all these kids were innocent and did nothing wrong while the cops busted through the door of the motel with a vengeance.  I listened to the audio version and the author reads the kids' parts with a woe-is-me tone while the police officers' parts were read with a horribly, mean tough-guy tone.  Kids say things like, ""Why are you doing that to me?  What did I do wrong?  Why are you hitting me?... with a desparate tone.  The police officers say things like, ""SHUT UP!  I SAID TO STAND UP!  I DON'T CARE WHAT YOU THINK!""... with a nasty tone.  The author skirts over the issue that one of the kids grabbed the police officers arm, so maybe... just maybe... that's why he was put on the ground with his hands behind his back.  After I stopped reading in Chapter 3, I researched the actual event and the story was VERY different than what the author THINKS happened.  It's the author's first novel and it should be his last.",1,0,1586,0.12,0

After following Amanda Frederickson for the last 18 months on Instagram and loving her fridge foraging series, this book did not disappoint.  The recipes are easy to master and each one more delicious than the next.  One of my favorite things is how she writes her recipes.  The ingredients are listed as a shopping list and quantities of these ingredients are in the method.  At first I though this might be confusing but it actually reads really well and makes the recipe much easier to follow.  I would definitely recommend adding this book to your collection.

It is very well written, with a casual yet informative style that allowed me to be fully engaged, yet able to contemporaneously assess my own fears from a less personalized perspective.  Through her deeply introspective and open exploration of the causes and consequences of her own personal fears, Eva Holland explores how each of us can recognize, learn from, and treat the emotional, social, and physiological effects of fear.  Wherever your own personal fears fall on the scale from annoyance to paralysis, this book provides both an education and an invitation to explore fear to learn that it has discernable causes, understandable purposes, and an important role in everyday life.",5,0,743,0.113,1

We have James Hill, a British expatriate in El Salvador to thank for the way we drink coffee today.  He moved production from small batch to (for want of better words) corporate, taking coffee from a drink for the rich to something accessible for almost everyone.  Ironically, of course, the current trend among some is in the reverse.  This is written in a journalistic manner, although there are plenty of notes and opportunities to delve deeper.

Very honest and open about both his successes and failures.  He's lived a big life and been in the heart of things for sure.  Took a star off because there wasn't much written about the late sixties / early seventies when the Airplane was really one of the biggest bands around.  Seems like most of the book could have been about this time and his experiences of superstardom.  I understand that it's a personal (not band) book and he did a lot of other things too.  But there's a lot more personal detail than is maybe needed.  Still a great look into the man and his music.  Recommended.",4,0,766,0.136,1
1263,"May 23, 2020  Fierce, Free and Full of Fire  Jen HatmakerI read this for the purpose of review for Net Galley.  Initially I was hesitant about the book.She writes for today, encouraging women to be who they are not what someone expects them to be.She also gives thought provoking subjects as to a woman's value, view and vision.  She is not afraid to face the issues head on.In the beginning I thought she was a bit negative on males but soon realized she is simply very positive on females and desires for the female to see her self valuable and important in every day life.  Each woman's life looks different but each life has a definite place in life.So, ladies take heart and be looking to finish the course set before you, not the one set before you.Thank you Ms. Hatmaker",3,0,777,0.143,1

With that being said, I believe that after reading this one, I’ve very interested in reading another one by them.  They kept me engaged in wanting to know what was coming next.  There were multiple stories going on at the same time, but not too many where I couldn’t keep track of them and they all seemed to fit together by some thread in the tapestry of the story.  The thing that hit me most was the importance of moving through forgiveness and not allowing a heart of bitterness to ruin one’s soul.I received an ARC of this book from the publisher in exchange for my honest review.",5,0,773,0.115,0
1265,"""Put Your Dream To The Test"" by John Maxwell is a challenging and encouraging title for the reader who is wondering about whether or not a particular dream should be pursued.The covers 10 main areas of a dream:  Ownership, Clarity, Reality, Passion, Pathway, People, Cost, Tenacity, Fulfillment, and Significance.Among the points covered by Maxwell include:1.  A clear vision of your dream should come first before implementing the strategy to achieve your dream.2.  Do not depend on luck, your dream must meet with reality to be achievable.  Focus on what you can do and then do it.3.  3 significant things that passion does for us.4.  3 positions to consider in the process of achieving your dream.5.  If you want to achieve a dream, you need a team to help you.6.  5 things that are true for everyone who pursues a dream.7.  People who live their dream refuse to give up.8.  6 things to learn while living in the gap between the birth of a dream and its realization.9.  We cannot help others if we have nothing to offer.10. Make sure you consistently live out what you say.The books is yet another great Maxwell title.  The author readily gives credit to people of several different cultures and backgrounds whose quotes are included in the book.  The only comlaint is that I would have liked to have seen more Bible verses and more examples of Christians and people mentioned in the Bible who pursued and fulfilled their God-given dream.Still, a highly recommended title.Read, enjoy, and be encouraged and challenged to reflect on and pursue with passion your dream!",4,0,1570,0.202,0

1267,"Below I will give my review for the book generally, but first a word about whether to choose the full or young reader version.  Of course every child is different, so if in doubt, always better to read anything for yourself first.  However, I'll say that my rising 8th grade son and his summer book club read the full version and my rising 6th grade daughter and her summer book club primarily read the young reader version, and I think these were the right book choices for each of the.  I read the full version but also checked in on the youth version along the way to note the differences.  The youth version is definitely going to be a less intense and more appropriate read for middle graders, but personally I enjoyed the full version more of course.Trevor Noah's story could only be told through autobiography, because who could do a better telling than the brilliant Trevor Noah himself?  Complete with his signature humor and wit, Trevor tells the story of his life in South Africa from his birth under the apartheid regime—where his mere existence as a biracial child was a crime—to his coming-of-age in the post-apartheid era.  It is a story that is personal to his unique existence as an outsider to the strictly categorized groups of South African society and yet as an outsider who managed to navigate among all of these groups.  In one moment, the South African story will feel foreign to the American reader and then in the next instance eerily familiar to the continuing narrative of racism in our own country. From craft to content, this is a five-star read from start to finish.",5,0,1597,0.083,0

I thought this book was beautifully written, with a fantastic world building atmosphere, and amazingly developed characters.  I got really engaged in the beginning and had a hard time putting it down, but toward the end it started dragging and I found myself not coming back to it very easily, which is why I gave it 4-5 stars instead of a plain 5 star.

The exercises contained within the older version with the orange and white cover and this newer version are exactly the same, however the difference is the printing.  The older version is not as crowded and it is printed with much more contrast as compared to the new version (pictured).  I personally find that the older version is easier for me to work with as a beginner student.  My cello instructor has also found that for new students the older version is less overwhelming.  Older versions are available from the various sellers of used books.

1270,"We are living in a time filled with fear and anxiety.  When the world around is so uncertain and unfamiliar, the mind tends to wander toward the worries.  This book comes out at the perfect time as more and more people are suffering from anxiety, depression and mental health decline.Written by pastor David Chadwick, ""Moving Beyond Anxiety"" addresses the Christian way to address anxiety via 12 practical strategies designed to help the reader re-think and renew their minds.  From the very start, Chadwick introduces readers to the definitions of fear and anxiety and proposes that to address fear, we must first address anxiety.This book is an easy read, chock full of scripture, sound reasoning and Christian guidance to help lead individuals struggling with anxiety toward a path of renewal and healing, on toward a life where anxiety is no longer in control, but instead viewed as a tool of the enemy used to draw our eyes from our faith in Christ.  It is written in a soothing, fatherly manner that is calming and feels as if one is sitting down to chat with a trusted friend or counselor as opposed to being ""taught"".  Very refreshing and comforting to read!Being one of the people struggling with anxiety terribly over the pandemic and the crisis abounding in our nation and even in my state and nearby cities, I was so excited to get my hands on this book, with hopes of freedom or at least some relief from the struggles I have daily with my mental health.  I have not been disappointed.  I have picked up many tools and ideas to lead me on my walk toward tackling this part of my thinking.  There is so much in this book that I am set to read it a second, and probably third time because I want to fully absorb every bit of wisdom I can.  I have also recommended it to many of my friends who are in similar situations currently on their walk through anxiety.

It's clear Albert did her research about hot shots which makes the book all the more real.  The MC's are engaging and have the chemistry for a great pairing.  The dialogue is clever and quick.  Each character is multi-layered and deals with his own demons while being vulnerable to the other.  Albert's MC's never live in a bubble- she excels at bringing family and friends into their orbit, making them intriguing as well.  That is definitely the case here.

There's a pasta recipe that provides no temperature for heating the pasta (it says, ""melt the butter"" - on medium? medium low? medium high? in the microwave?) and unless you're an experienced cook, it may be challenging for you to follow.  There's a recipe for bread crumbs where the volume measurement (1 1/2 cups) and weight measurement (250 grams) are incongruous - which is it?  Another recipe omits adding some ingredients so you have to guess on when to add them.It's unfortunate - her Everyday California Food cookbook is so precise and easy to follow.

1274,"Are you living your life to fulfill YOUR dream or are you trying to fulfill someone else's dream?John C. Maxwell raises questions like this throughout this book.  I'm not going to list all the questions that he wants you to ask yourself - you can read the table of contents or someone else's review for that.  However, the two questions that struck me most were:  The Reality Question and The Passion Question.Is the dream that I am trying to achieve really MY dream and is there a real chance that it can be achieved?  I even slightly disagreed with Maxwell on the latter part as I believe that just about any dream can be achieved with enough hard work and know-how.  But one doesn't want to spend years banging one's head against a brick wall when it just might be easier to find a door in the wall or a ladder to climb the wall.  There ARE other ways to achieve a dream than straight on.But the passion question stumped me.  I'd been having trouble supporting a project under my umbrella and it suddenly dawned on me:  I wasn't passionate about it because it was someone else's dream, not mine!  I may yet be able to find a way to tie it into my dream, but for right now, it's best if I just do what I really care about and let others pursue their own passion.Maxwell writes in a clear, concise manner.  If you're an underliner, you'll find plenty of nuggets to underline.  He includes many quotes from others to support his arguments (maybe too many), but his manner is upbeat and personable.If you're floundering or feel you have lost direction, this may just be the book to inspire you and fire you up again.FOLLOW YOUR DREAMS!",5,0,1634,0.189,1
1275,"maps out the policies, business innovations and grassroots solutions providing ideas for what we can each do to improve our health and the health of our communities and planet.” (pg 5-6, Food Fix)Dr. Mark Hyman’s newest book is filled with facts I found shocking.  Somehow, seeing the numbers in black and white makes them more jarring than just hearing them on a news report from the T. V.  -  “for every 10% of your diet that comes from processed food, your death risk increases by 14%”  That one really floored me.  Not so much for myself, but I’ve got younger members of my family who I’d venture to say devote far more than 10% of their diet to processed food.  If that statistic is accurate, their future is dubious.  My generation didn’t eat “processed” as a general rule and I’m in my last few laps.  They, on the other hand, have miles to go...Being the good doctor that he is, Hyman spends time discussing the effects of various health crises (obesity and all its co-morbidities, hunger, chronic disease) have on the global economy.  These numbers are also staggering.  When you read his extrapolation for the next 35 years, we’ll, it helped me understand the term “mind bending”,  for the first time 😳A good portion of the book looks at the government’s programs and agencies that over see food,  big AG and big FOOD.  These are massive institutions that hold political sway and determine the course of how and what we eat to a large extent.  Hyman is not shy about casting a light on the job they’ve done, where and how they’ve failed and his suggestions for what we need to do to save the planet from sure demise.There are lots of suggestions for how to fix things in this book.  Recommendations are made for personal changes that will impact your own health, (and finances, btw), the health of your family and that of your immediate community.  Then he gets global and suggests how the “Food Fix” at the local, regional, national and world wide levels will work, interact and impact the world.Hyman identifies companies doing a good job, what they’re doing and how.  This book is not just Chicken Little squawking about a falling sky; it’s problem identification with realistic resolution proposals.  The writing is good, and at times felt like an espionage investigation.  Hhhhmmm...📚",4,2,2299,0.09,1
1276,"Julia Kitson Fairbright is the daughter-in-law of the rigid Duke of Sprogsfield.  She was married to his son for a while, but he died in a shipping accident, and the duke has made it his mission to ensure that his grandson, Chatwyn, is raised under his control and with the greatest of decorum.  He expects Julia to 'tow the line' as well and never step out of the bounds placed by society on those associated with the duke.  Unfortunately, Julia is beginning to chafe under the strict rules placed upon her and her son.  She now knows that the strict moral code that the duke follows in public, is not the same code that he follows in his private dealings, after overhearing a conversation between him and his solicitor.  Julia is determined to get her hands on certain documents that will ensure her freedom from the 'prison' that the duke imposes upon her and Chatwyn.  Garrett Stockton has been roaming the seas for the better part of a decade.  He has accumulated wealth and a rakish reputation.  However, he is a gentleman in trade, which means many others look down their noses at him.  He rescues Julia from a particularly embarrassing situation, and seeks to know her better.  Because of her fear of the duke, she shuts him down, knowing he would never approve of Garrett. As the story progresses, they are thrown together through a series of events, and eventually get to know each other better.There is a steady, low-level tension present as one reads this book.  Will Julia find the papers?  Will she ever get her freedom?  Will the duke return soon and take over her life again?  Will Garrett ever find happiness with Julia?  Will Chatwyn grow up under the strict guidelines of the duke?  As these questions and others find answers, the book progresses steadily.  There is much to like about this book!  The interactions between precocious Chatwyn and others are delightful to read. The relationship between Julia and Garrett progresses fairly rapidly, but considering that she has been held just shy of being a prisoner for the past four years, that's somewhat expected.  Julia's character grows steadily throughout the book, and her friend, Brina, does as well.  It appears that Brina will be featured in the next story of the series.

1278,"Author Jon Pessah has done an outstanding and monumental job in relating the life of American icon, Lawrence Peter ""Yogi"" Berra.  The book contains 507 pages of text and covers every facet one may imagine regarding the life of the baseball immortal.  Berra had one ambition, to become a baseball player and he succeeded beyond any measure.  Yogi's father wanted him to get a real job and not waste his time playing baseball.  From growing up poor and meeting the woman who was to become his wife who was a waitress at Biggie's restaurant in St. Louis, a World War II veteran involved in the Normandy invasion to a Hall of Fame catcher with the fabled New York Yankees Yogi Berra lived a full life.The book covers the jokes Berra had to endure from others who thoughtlessly didn't think that sometimes this nonsense goes too far, his managerial career with the Yankees and Mets, including the difficulties managing those who were his friends such as Ford and Mantle (who didn't do anything to make it an easy transition for Yogi), his 14 year strained relationship with owner George Steinbrenner, Berra's lifelong friendship with Joe Garagiola, son Dale's drug use,  his Yogi Berra Museum and Learning Center in New Jersey, and the difficulty he and his wife Carmen faced in their declining years.  Berra still insists Jackie Robinson was out on his steal of home in the 1955 World Series.  I don't remember who the batter was at the plate when this occurred but  I remember reading in another book where the batter said he thought Robinson was out. The book contains two sections of photos with eight pages in each section.  One of the photos shows a picture of Berra, Joe Garagiola, Red Schoendienst, and two other players listed as Howie Pollet and Clem Labine.  I'm convinced that is not Clem Labine and I'm not sure about Howie Pollet either.Even with 507 pages of text I found it hard to put the book down.  It's an easy read and I found it to be very interesting reading from beginning to end since I can readily remember many of the anecdotes told in the book.  It was a pleasure to go back and relive this time period.  Another plus in the book is that it doesn't get bogged down in game play-by-play which, to me at least, is irritating in baseball books that do this.  Do yourself a favor.

1279,"3.5/5.0What a lovely written story!  The sentences flow beautifully from one to the next to create an absolute joy to experience. The characters come to life easily with personalities that are believable and sympathetic.  I especially loved Althea's character.  She is strong yet vulnerable, feisty yet insecure.  Her troubles fitting in are achingly real a reader can't help but hurt and hope for her as she works so very hard to overcome the prejudices and injustice others hurl her way.Nathaniel is also a very intriguing character.  While his situation wasn't quite as sympathetic, and one might prefer throttling him at times, his saving grace is his loyalty and honor to those he cares about.  It's fun watching him struggle to stay away from Althea while everything in him is pushing him toward her and her kind, loving heart.The biggest problem in the story is how casually the sex is addressed between Althea and Nathaniel .  While their  attitudes would be completely normal in 21st century society, in the pre-regency world, this laissez faire approach by two characters of the peerage was so far-fetched and hard to believe that it throws the reader out of the story.There were also many mundane conversations and added on-dits that didn't have anything to do with the overall progression of the story and slowed the reading connection down considerably.Still, the overall plot and characters were so endearing that one can't help but be completely entertained and satisfied as that last page turns!",4,0,1511,0.23,0
1280,"John C. Maxwell writes a practical and thought-provoking book on how to achieve and attain one's dream.  Indeed, his assessment is a step by step guide as well as a case study where he provides examples from ordinary individuals who had a simple goal they wanted to achieve and later turned out to be extraordinary, such as the story about Elizabeth Keckly, a Virginia slave who was thought to be worthless by her owner but learned to make the best of her trying situation and taught herself to read and write, who became an entrepreneur and bought her freedom. There are many other stories that Maxwell tells that show the tenacity and persistence that each individual exemplified in order to pursue their dream in life no matter how small or large.  And to begin the examination, the title of the book simply states Maxwell's intentions for any reader who would like take the first step to PUT YOUR DREAM TO THE TEST:  10 QUESTIONS THAT WILL HELP YOU SEE IT AND SEIZE IT.And with all dreams or goals, Maxwell greatly emphasizes that there are no shortcuts.  The journey towards a dream simply takes plenty of sacrifice and contact with those who may assist on the road to where one wants to arrive; it is not a journey that is taken alone if one wants to succeed - everybody needs someone to share their dream with in any capacity.  Importantly, the book is highly motivational with one anecdote after another from people who have ever had a dream in mind.

This was slow to start but that's to be expected when they are setting up the story.  You have to pay attention to the names and even doing that it can still get confusing.  I know I went back a few times to re-read a paragraph to figure out who was talking.  Ex.  Hopes name would be at the beginning of the chapter so naturally you would think it was her speaking.  Not so, sometimes it was actually Annie or Laura.  I got the hang of it though and knew what was going on.  I felt bad for these girls, it's a sad story.  Sometimes today kids don't realize how good they have it.  They just expect you to buy them  car.  In my day we saved until we could get one ourselves.  I see so many kids today that just think it is owed to them for some reason.  My kids grew up on a teacher's salary so they knew we would not be handing them a car.  If they wanted one they could drive old Betty the Welsh Mobil van.  And they did until a drunk driver hit the van.  Then my son had to work to get his own.  Anyway, I thought it was an interesting read.  Finding out the girls backgrounds almost made me cry.  Made me feel like I just wanted to step into the book and take care of them.  Made me wonder if a mother's love and kind upbringing would have changed matters. Anyway, I recommend this read.  Once you get the characters straight it's a pretty good read.",4,0,1485,0.159,0
1292,"The negative reviews for this book were a little confusing for me to read.  It's a great book with lots of good ideas and it's written in a way that is informative and engaging without being douchey or pompous like many books on money seem to be.  I found it to be a great read, chalk-full of ways to improve my financial life.  Although Grant was admittedly pretty extreme in his journey to financial freedom, he also repeats over and over again to adapt these strategies to your own life in a way that works for you.  He's not telling you to Uber drive your way to being a millionaire; He's giving you the tools necessary to figure out your own path to financial freedom.  Not every page had something I plan on adapting into my life, but there were plenty of pages that did.  We are all different and Grant has compiled a ton of great ideas to help as many people as possible. You can argue tax optimization and asset allocation all you want, but if that's your major gripe with this book-you completely missed the point.I don't personally plan on ever ""retiring"" in a traditional sense, but I'll be damned if I ever again have to work I job I hate just to make enough money to live another day/week/month.  My quick and dirty advice: Buy this book, read it slowly while considering what you want your life to look like and spend some time thinking deeply about how to get there.  After that, find another book/blog/podcast to keep your mind and momentum going in the direction of progress.  You will be glad you did.",5,0,1520,0.174,0

Great explanation and advice on how increasing your personal discipline, resiliency, & attention to detail not only benefits you but also your community.  Unfortunately, wish the author would have made his point and then stopped talking.  While the first 9 chapters are well constructed and make powerful arguments that are largely non-partisan, the last chapter degenerates into a liberal bash session.  This unfortunately will cause it to miss a lot of the audience that would have benefited from it (liberals), and diminishes the otherwise great messages.",3,0,706,0.166,1

As Sarajane says, many enneagram resources can come off as being harsh and can make it difficulty to see, love, and integrate all of the wonderful things about each type.  Her approach, as she says, is honest and direct about the challenges each type faces - however, it goes beyond that to support readers in seeing what gems those challenges hold and how to work with them in supportive and self-loving ways.

1298,"Tin Heart is a contemporary fiction novel that follows a 17-year-old girl named Marlowe one year after having received a heart transplant.This is a beautiful story about a sensitive subject that the author handles with grace.  It was a potent tale about grief, organ donation and second chances, as well as the importance of family.The topic of this novel was an intense one, especially as Marlowe struggled and finally came to terms with the fact that the only reason she is alive is because someone else had to die.  Organ donation is one of those subjects that people rarely think about or talk about until disaster strikes, and I don't recall ever having read a fiction novel where this particular subject matter played a central role.  So in this way, the book encourages us to think about this important topic and perhaps even paves the way to discussion with friends and family.Though the storyline was no doubt a serious one and pulled at the reader's heartstrings in many places throughout the novel, the story was also sprinkled with plenty of humor, lighthearted banter and wit, rendering it an especially enjoyable and satisfying read.All in all, Tin Heart is a well-crafted, stunning contemporary novel of many layers, with a huge heart and an important message and is the kind of book that will hit you right in the heart (pun intended).

And at a time when most of us are probably not getting enough of that panacea, Alan steps in to lift our spirits and take us on a joy ride through roughly 50 years of comedy history gold.  Alan has attained the show business longevity that dreams are made of, and I think it's in large part due to the accessibility of his humor.  It's smart, it's quick, it's far superior to most people's, but it's relatable.  He's relatable.  So even though these pages are filled with big starry household names, all of whom Alan has known and worked with, the reader stills feels like he's/she's sitting with an old friend over coffee as he recounts a tale from his day at the office.

The research that J’nell Ciesielski did is evident and the cultural references added to a fuller experience of the times.  The storyline was action packed, as one would expect when reading about resistance to the Nazi regime.  The characters who decide to fight against evil find that they also have to fight against lies that they have believed about themselves, their identity and their past.  As a plan to escape France develops, so does a romance with battles of its own.  If you are interested in a romantic historical adventure, I highly recommend The Socialite.

The reason I didn't give it five stars is that I found the premise of the plot (can't say more without spoilers) to be farfetched.

She readily accepts the assignment and is thrust into a grueling crash course of  spycraft..  In cinematic fashion we're treated to the insurmountable plight of Kate in occupied Paris.  In astounding detail she sets up for the coup de grace shot at Hitler … only to be foiled by the unexpected presence of a child...  who bears a striking resemblance to Lisbeth.  Her momentary delay in taking the shot results in the inadvertent kill of a different high ranking Nazi ( the ramifications of this are unknown to Kate and the reader).  Kate is suddenly running for her life through the streets and historically accurate locals of Paris.  She is pursued and hounded by not only the Wehrmacht and Gestapo but a Munich police detective, Gunter Hoffman.  Gunter is highly scrupled and is only interested in seeking justice …  and certainly not a proponent of Gestapo techniques or even the Nazis in general.

As this back story is set, the characters flee the negative publicity to a community from their mother's past that they did not  know existed.Eliza Maxwell has woven the two sisters and their story along side the story of the two sisters they find taking care of their mother's past home.  Each layer of the story reveals family history that set the stage for the current sisters to either bond together or face their demons alone.

It is a comic book without art work.what happeded to Decker...where did he go.....he is not in this book, but is just a shadow.Jamison has been reduced to making inane comments along the way.The dialog is stilted and unrealisticStory line (s) way too contrived.  The only thing left out is aliens.We have the arrival of super-heroes....YEA!...robie and reel....what caricatures!I usually give away books I have read.This one, however, is going in the trash.

Don't buy this book if that is what you are looking for.

1337,"The issue for me reading this is the author admits at the beginning of the publication he’s part of the illegal effort in releasing classified information from the White House which is a federal offence that will put you in jail for 10 years for each count.  You will not see this fact from people supporting this junk, why is that?As a reminder, Congressman Chuck Schumer reported live on national television that the intelligence agencies have 7 ways from Sunday at getting back at you.  You will not see this from people supporting this junk, why is that? The author only referenced JFK three times in this book all while claiming there is no deep state, why is that? The author failed to reference the relationship between the CIA, Cocaine and opium, why is that?The author eventually writes about the damage done to the FBI because of leaking/passing classified info from the FBI however the author seems to think what he’s been a part of is ok and attempted to suggest that his part in releasing classified info from the White house is righteous is just damn insulting, specifically after the author tried to imply Trump was acting sort of strange after 6 months in the white house all while forgetting to point out there’s been over 100 leaks of classified information out of the White House in that same 6 months.  That’s a thousand years in jail and I really, really hope some of these people that are a part of the deep state will get to share a part of that thousand years and to be sure, I am pointing out people like this author who are trying to spin up the truth of the matter.I hate this book and I think the author is playing a dangerous game of miss information or more specifically, just trying to undermine what the hell is really going on in this nation and a different example of the author attempting to be selective is where the one passage from the IG report the author quoted.  The author screwed up big time as I personally own and I’ve read the IG report and I know for a fact people from the FBI are going to go to jail and you can fact check my claims by observing some of the passages I presented on my factual review of that government doc.Very specifically, the author lost any sort of integrity by quoting just that one passage from the IG and he did that specifically in the attempt to distorted the facts that the FBI screwed up, badly. It was a damn coup attempt and I think this author is a pos as he’s attempting to excuse the fact that Mueller, who was in charge of the FBI on 9/11 reported the FBI had no clue about what would eventually happen that day and then Mueller supported the claim there were weapons of mass destruction.  Trump called that bs out and he got investigated by the same Mueller although the Mueller team already knew there was no proof  of Russian collusion and they did this just to politically damage the Trump and all one has to do is read the Mueller hearings to start with.I will admit, I was surprised the author actually referenced the 9/11 Congressional Report which is different from the fake created 9/11 commission report.  Even so, I don't think the author has even read the Congressional report from Congress because the author failed to point out the 9/11 Congressional report will reveal the attack that day was state sponsored. I know this because I presented a review of the Congressional report a few years back noting what was written on page 174 of the document.The author also wrote about Peter Scott Dale’s comments about the deep state however the author failed to point out the details of why the conservation in the first place and who else was involved in that event Dale was writing about and why the source backed out in talking with the author.There is a deep, shadow government and the event Peter Scott Dale was talking about involved this:The Politics of Heroin: CIA Complicity in the Global Drug Trade Paperback – May 1, 2003 by Alfred W. McCoyThere’s more…a whole hell of a lot more and I've taken several years to follow up and my historical foot print on Amazon will prove my intent to understand what are State Crimes and I think this author is a part of efforts to undermine my god given rights.  I read the book fully and completely and actually created a list of over 50 areas in the book that is just missed information or more specifically, just selected distorted stuff but in the end, the stupid fakes are going to support this junk regardless.  Idiots are supporting the coup attempt in this nation and this is one of those books that will keep you dumb.Finally, a detailed breakdown on how the primary mass media news and information platforms in this nation tried to screw you (the author is a part of) personally can be discovered  by reading the publication, The Plot Against the President: The True Story of How Congressman Devin Nunes Uncovered the Biggest Political Scandal in U.S. History or a different approach to understand this would be to read the publication, Into The Buzzsaw: LEADING JOURNALISTS EXPOSE THE MYTH OF A FREE PRESS  for one.This book In Deep is a waste and is written for suckers as the book is not recommend for mature Americans looking for honest information.  I most strongly encourage the author to respond as I've accused him of promoting the coup attempt in this nation and I think the author a fraud.",1,6,5345,0.065,1
1338,"Melissa Foster’s funniest book ever.  That being said it still has all the hallmarks of a great romance; there are fantastic sigh-worthy kisses, steamy sex scenes and heart-wrenching moments as we follow Piper and Harley going from friends to lovers.  Piper is a strong, feisty woman who is fiercely protective of her siblings and Harley is her best friend who want to convince her he can love her just as she is.  Piper has a lot to overcome but Harley is there supporting and encouraging her at every step.  It’s a small-town romance between friends destined to become lovers.

This is done by providing training, and by creating a company culture that equips front line employees to probe for the not so obvious problems and implement fixes.

Kip, a child prodigy, has wandered far from Jake's values of integrity and honesty and must find his way back.  The setting is a courtroom where Jake defends Kip against multiple federal charges.

1347,"Thank you so much to Wednesday Books via NetGalley for the e-ARC in exchange for an honest review, all opinions are my own.I read Wicked Saints as an ARC too and enjoyed the basis of the story, although found Duncan's writing style to be repetitive to the nauseatingly ""I need to skim"" point of being terrible.  I thought she would take that round of criticism from Wixked Saints and build a better novel (with editorial assistance) in Ruthless Gods....and OH god was I wrong.If I had to read *one of 5 adjectives_____boy"" one more time I would have died.  She has the continent's ENTIRE future political leadership trekking across the country and all they do is continue to chase each other's tails.  Maybe the hunter couldn't have done much politically but can we treat Serefin like the actual king of Tranavia?  This entire trek could have been EPIC and all we got was more of ""blah blah I was betrayed blah  and now I'm afraid but let's kiss again"" and Nadya's broken record just played, and played, and played.Oh yeah, Nadya thinks that she did but she really learned nothing from book 1 and she's still terrible.  She is changing but doesn't seem to be internalizing any of her lessons, although Kostya comes back long enough to force some true self-reflection.  That particular dynamic was surprising and one of the more interesting ones.Duncan did do a bit of a better job showing monstrosities versus just talking about them, but again it was so repetitive.  I did like her take on the gods and monsters and older beings, but she could have used Nadya's broken record headspace to talk more about some of the Slavic lore she was throwing out in names and titles only.  That is something I'd like to have read about.Serefin was my favorite character again because he is amazing, even though Duncan turned him into the token ""other"" character.  I really think Ostyia would have been enough in that department.  Serefin and his moths and his bad vision and his nonexistent brutality (talk talk talk, never shown) just make me happy, and I think he had the most interesting arc in this book.  If nothing else Duncan did use his and Malachiasz's time together to explain all of the Tranavian political hierarchy that was missing from Wicked Saints.Last but not least: the @OneReadingNurse infamous medical rant. Have you ever actually seen a pupil blow?  I have. Someone having a stroke?  A blown pupil is TERRIFYING, and having someone's pupils ""blow open"" is TERRIBLE choice of phrase for someone surprised or experiencing adrenaline. Not only that but I think it was used at least 3 times throughout the book and I just don't understand why an editor didn't clam this up.The ending (other than the last sentence which again was a terrible word choice, but sounded cool) was almost enough of a cliffhanger to make me want book 3, but I don't think the plot is enough to cancel out Duncan's writing.  I will be waiting for the cliffnotes version.In summary: if you liked Wicked Saints, read this, if not or if you were on the fence, stay away.  Ruthless Gods IS marginally better but I personally can't do it for a third novel.",2,0,3132,0.144,1

1357,"This book greatly appealed to me as I have always been interested in mental health and I studied psychology and counseling in college.  I did not want to put this book down as the story of the Galvin family is tragically fascinating and I wanted to know how the story ended.The book begins with how the parents, Mimi and Donald, grew up and how they began their own family.  Throughout the book, you get insight into each of the 12 Galvin childrens' lives from their births and childhoods to their teenage and adult years.  The book speaks about many major events that happened with the family and how the different members coped with those events, specifically the 6 schizophrenia diagnoses and how each individual family member was impacted.  The book spans almost 100 years of the Galvin family as it ends in present time.What I love best about this book is how it weaves chapters that detail the family's story with chapters that give background on the research that has been done with schizophrenia from well known Freud and Jung to modern day researchers like Dr. Robert Freedman.  Including the research helps readers to better understand the complexity of schizophrenia and how the family was treated over the years as knowledge of the illness has grown.  Including the history of schizophrenia research also helps the reader understand just how vital this family's story is.I would highly recommend this book to any reader, but specifically to individuals who are interested in psychology and/or neuropsychology or family dynamics.",5,1,1540,0.11,1

It's a jumble that slows the story and doesn't allow the reader to really identify with any one of the girls.  What should have been a gut-wrenching read was oddly...lacking.

The best part is that the book is extremely inspirational and can make a difference in your life, too if you can apply the same concepts that Jake did.

Both stories are well conceived, though Kingpin's is arguably the more interesting.

1365,"Writing: 4/5 Plot: 4/5 Characters: 5/5A set of interconnected stories as told by prison guards in New Hampshire’s  Barker County Correctional Facility or “The House.”  Each unfolds specific events, though the import of the story comes not from the events themselves but from what they uncover about the life of the person telling the story: a sexual attraction, a fellow officer’s suicide, a softball game between law enforcement branches, the attempted suicide of an inmate, the processing of an accused child killer, etc.This is way outside of my comfort zone — everything I’ve ever learned about prison comes from documentaries,  bad TV shows, and sensationalized news stories — all with their own agenda.  I liked this book because it didn’t appear to come with any specific political agenda — the focus was far more on individual lives.  And there were no real stereotypes — each guard is a distinct human being with his/her own motivations, coping mechanisms, and personal context.  Some are withdrawn, some mean, some afraid.  Many are dealing with their own personal issues while trying to maintain an acceptable demeanor. Not your typical adventure story, it’s all character.  It also includes fascinating descriptions of typical days in a correctional facility from the perspective of those who run it:  the tiers, transportation, property management, and booking.

1381,"This is a well-written book on the history of the Braves franchise in Milwaukee from 1953-1965.  Understand, however, this is NOT a review of the team and its players during this period.  This book IS a review of the front office and county board relations with the ball club's front office.  In other words there is very little baseball to be had here.  It covers the whirlwind romance of the team followed by a contentious divorce thirteen years later.  I rate the books five stars because I feel author Patrick Steele has done an outstanding job in researching this subject.  However, my interest in the wrangling between the county and the ball club eventually took its toll. I am old enough to well-remember the years the Braves spent in Milwaukee with Earl Gillespie and The Blaner behind the mic  The early euphoria with a team on the rise reached its zenith with a World Championship in 1957 and eventually things had to taper off due to various issues between the county and the team which began to age into the 1960s led to the sale of the team to the Carpetbaggers from Chicago.I have fond memories of the Milwaukee Braves including attending the 1965 home opener and organizing trips for Little Leaguers in 1964 (Dodgers) and 1965 (Giants).  The Chicago White Sox played one game against each American League opponent during 1967-1969 until the city was rewarded when the bankrupt Seattle Pilots moved to Milwaukee to become the Brewers following spring training in 1970.",5,1,1483,0.133,1
1382,"Could not put it down.  Grant has an amazing ability to put things into context that non-technical, non-financial, non-mathematical people can easily understand.  He had a way of putting into words what I have been feeling for at least the last 3-4 years, just didn't know how to get it out.  Even better than the book itself, is the community that is growing parallel to it.  I've already joined the Facebook group, and had a really great email exchange with Grant himself!  He cares about the people, and truly wants to help.  It's so refreshing, and honest, unbiased, and easy to digest.  Could not recommend more.  Thank you, Grant, for showing us the path.

1383,"I bought the audible and his voice is calming but strong as he reads common sense that isn't as common as it should be.  He stresses being objective and reasoning things out.  This is a fantastic book by a man who has more insight to bills than anyone in Congress, he does his homework and doesn't jump to conclusions.  He's amazingly smart and can't be played and doesn't want US citizens to be fooled by the people in politics and the media that have an agenda and know how to manipulate.  He also warns us of the perils of believing what is seen on social media.  A former navy SEAL, he's everything our country NEEDS as a representative.  He's tough, yet kind and thoughtful and highly intelligent.",5,0,702,0.183,0
1384,"Dead on the Vine by Elle Brooke White has Charlotte Finn heading to Little Acorn, California after inheriting Finn Family Farm from her great-uncle Tobias.  Charlotte has fond memories of a magical summer she spent there as a child.  While touring the property with a realtor, they find a man dead with a pitchfork in his neck.  Charlotte also learns that someone has been sabotaging the farm and two local yokels claim the farm should belong to them.  Charlotte works with her two best friends plus a pig named Horse and a ladybug named Mrs. Robinson to catch the culprit and save Finn Family Farm.  Dead on the Vine is the debut of A Finn Family Farm Mystery series.  I enjoyed this engaging cozy mystery with an interesting cast of characters.  Charlotte Finn has been living in Chicago working in advertising.  She has thoughts of putting the farm up for sale, but Charlotte quickly falls under the farms spell.  Her two best friends, Diane and Beau (brother and sister) are joining her at the farm.  Diane is a chef who loves all the fresh produce available and Beau is a flamboyant event planner (imagine Beau picking produce in a blue speedo with the score to Oklahoma blaring in the background).  Alice and Ben Wong are the farm’s caretakers and Samuel Brown is the hunky farmer.  My favorite character is Horse, the adorable and intelligent pig who follows Charlotte around the farm.  Horse is an smart little fellow who has Mrs. Robinson, the ladybug, traveling on his head.  There are other animals on the farm who add humor to the story.  There is a barn scene with goat yoga that had me laughing out loud.  Dead on the Vine is well-written and moves along at a steady pace.  I dived into the story and stayed up very late to finish it.  The mystery is interesting with a variety of suspects.  The whodunit suited the story and the characters.  Dead on the Vine is a cute cozy mystery that made me laugh and smile (a rarity).  I look forward to the next A Finn Family Farm Mystery.  Dead on the Vine is a witty whodunit with a precious pig, a little ladybug, sneaky sabotage, a pointy pitchfork, fun friends, and a family farm.*I voluntarily read an advanced copy of this book.

1385,"Enjoyed this second book for the young Blue Team.  I hope more are planned for the future.  Here are some of the reasons I liked this book.  (1) The interactions of the Blue Team with each other, kidding around, helping John when his decisions were not the best.  Also, the way the team worked together when fighting.  (2)  Seeing how John's ability to command is developing. (3) The cast-offs, totally disrespectful of the UNSC and great fighters and survivors.  (4)  The humor.  I laughed a bunch of times.  Like when John was telling the Wheatley to watch out for spider things.  (5) Adding to the humor, there were mainly 4 groups involved in this story.  Each was doing something that confused the other groups.  A great example was the banshee '""attack"" on John and Fred.",5,0,777,0.211,0
1386,"May is the survivor of a shootout at school.  She survived because she was looking for a music stand in a closet in the band room.  She heard the gun shooting and students begging, yelling and the band teacher saying “ shoot me, not them.”  May heard the shooting stopped but could not leave the closet.  She knew her twin, Jordan had been killed.  She couldn’t face it.  She had therapy after the funeral but it didn’t help — she wouldn’t answer any questions.  She was kicked out of school due to her anger which caused fights.  The school where the students were killed was closed.  May was allowed to go to the new school as long as she behaves.  She is still so upset after a year.  Why?  She only had one friend, Lucy which helped her keep from fighting.  As time goes by she meets a guy named Zach.  They become friends.  When she finds out his mother is defending the student who did the killing, she can’t believe it.  Zach can’t believe that May was the one who spray-painted his family garage door. Will they still be friends?It’s a novel of survival and hope after a loved one’s death.  It’s what happens to a family trying to cope with the loss.  It’s about the lucky ones that survive after a school shooting.  It shows the damage the shooters do.  It is not a simple novel.Disclaimer:  I received an arc of this book from the author/publisher from NetGalley.  I wasn’t obligated to write a favorable review or any review at all.

1387,"This has all the makings for a great History Channel special, a great historical event, an engaging mystery and the personal story of the researcher who puts the pieces together.  And this is perfect for our family because our oldest son became obsessed with the sub after reading about it.  We even went to Charleston to see it in person, and this book brings the Hunley into even more focus.Thanks to our son, I knew quite a bit of this story, but this added a lot of details and was an interesting scientific/engineering question.

1388,"The author, George Zaidan, is a recognized science TV communicator and also a featured writer for national magazines.  This is his first book about the chemicals we apply to our bodies or add to our framework.  It is chock full of information, most all of it interesting, however unfortunately not coherently organized.  In his chapter on processed foods, the question of what actually defines a processed food, whether whatever it is,  or if it is healthy or not, remains ambiguous.  In his lambastic manner, all sorts of questions about chemicals are tossed about seeded with pungent puns.  He delves into the process of photosynthesis, or the operations developed by aphids into securing food with great detail, along with descriptions of the plant mechanisms developed for defense.  So much interest devoted to poisons such as cyanide, formaldehyde, and nicotine; best to whet morbid interest in such lethal substances.  Much space is devoted to smoking danger, and then a look at vaping, to show the nasty ingredients and their potential hazards. Interest in the ultraviolet rays and sunscreen ingredients follow.  Written in an hyperactive style reminiscent of a TV script where science is shown to be explosively miraculous fun, this book attempts to engage readers by transforming science into a circus act rather than draw it as a contemplative and fascinating theme.",3,0,1376,0.169,0
1389,"I absolutely loved book 1 in the James Reece series, The Terminal List.  It mashed up the military action thriller with a revenge tale that made for an explosive read from cover to cover.  I was really excited for the followup, True Believer, but it left me wanting.  It was good, but somewhat forgettable and took a really long time getting the character into action and out of the African bush.Savage Son does not have this problem.  The prologue sets up a premise that while inspired by several other novels and movies over time has not recently been explored in this genre.  Mix that with a character like Reece and move back to the revenge/payback elements that were so good in book 1 and you have me absolutely hooked.  Can't wait for the next one.",5,0,754,0.156,1
1390,"I was rather hoping for a HEA ending, but Scalzi's plots don't follow familiar tropes and the ending was nonetheless very satisfying.  Nice to see female characters taking centre stage.  I particularly like his characterisation - he allows even the villain moments of self-reflection plus the heroes have their flaws.  The story almost seems prophetic given what's going on in the world right now, re the pandemic.  His sophisticated wielding of humour keeps the story rippling along, even when the universe is facing a dire situation.  I didn't understand all the technical elements of the 'flow' but it wasn't necessary to my overall enjoyment.  His books are on my keeper shelf.",5,0,681,0.239,0

1392,"This book is a tale of the German army's advance on Moscow as told from an army doctor's perspective.  I would suggest this book to anyone who is interested in WWII history.  It is VERY easy to read, as it reads much like a novel.  It counters some historians who say that the German army made it to a maximum of 30 miles outside of Moscow before being turned back, because the author actually stood at the Moscow tram stop and looked upon the great city.  It also is worthy of reading due to on-site stories of the battles instead of a generals point of view some miles back from the actual fighting.

The series is based on four men the Earl of Macklin thought he might be able to help and after having dinner with the men in London and discussing the death of their loved ones, the earl spends the summer traveling to each man’s estate and playing matchmaker.Peter Rathbone, the eccentric Duke of Compton, was struggling to keep his crumbling family’s estate together.  He was surprised when Macklin showed up at his home and even more surprised when Ada Grandison and her companions arrived that same afternoon.  Even though a duke, Peter hadn’t gone to the traditional schools’ other gentlemen went to and had never been a part of Society, so he wasn’t skilled in social graces, but he was glad for their company.Ada had discovered Delia at the bottom of the cliff, and she felt certain Delia wanted her to take her discovery to Peter.  Even though Peter doesn’t want anything to do with the mystery once they learn Delia was looking for the family’s hidden treasure, Ada is determined to find the treasure.  She had fallen in love with Peter and knew they needed to find the treasure if they wanted a future together.I have enjoyed reading the series but must admit this was not my favorite book in the series.

Especially the part about the pain in the ass.  We're all stuck together right now, and that kind of rings extra true right now.What this book was, to me, is a book quite unlike any other book I've read in this genre.  McHargue is correct: this is NOT a self help book.  It's part memoir, part cognitive science, and part inspirational text.  At times, as he swings from genre to genre, it feels a bit muddy.  However, his story is still compelling and his point sound.  We all are pretty damn awesome at the end of the day, even if we don't always feel that way.",4,0,742,0.17,1
1396,"In his 52nd book, the tenth of which I now have in my own home, John C. Maxwell brings the esoteric dream into living, breathing color.  Coming from the simple perspective that most of us have a dream, yet lack the tools to turn its greyness into the black-and-white of reality, he proposes ten leading questions to help us get there.  My version of this book also included its companion volume: My Dream Map, a 50-page workbook for personalizing, journaling, and living your vision.As with any Maxwell book, the challenge comes early: Put your dream to the test.  Spiced with powerful quotes, energizing stories of common-name successes, he draws you through the 10 questions to uncover the gritty realities of a dream you may only have held to yourself.  From the beginning of the book, he encourages sharing with three people you are close to, for both evaluation and encouragement of this pursuit.  Whether you can only tackle small portions of this book, or are working through the entire thing with your goal clearly in mind, or even simply need inspiration to allow yourself to dream, Maxwell has provided it.  Consistently, he also points solidly towards Jesus as the author of our dreams, and the enabler of them to be accomplished.I found his engaging style to be an easy read, perfect for myself, or a gift - Father's Day?  I highly recommend it.I was given a complimentary copy of this book in exchange for my review, as part of the Booksneeze review blogger group.",4,0,1477,0.218,0

The Flow, the space time mechanism that keeps planets and billions of people connected -- is failing and various pieces of the universe are becoming permanently disconnected from the rest of humanity.  This story follows the possible collapse of the empire as those within continue to deny and / or profit from the collapse.  Sound familiar?  That's the beauty of science fiction -- our modern problems hidden inside stories of alien worlds.  With the wit and sass we've come to expect from Scalzi, this is a fast, engaging, read.

Even though I have seen just about every movie with Tombstone in it's name, this book made me feel as if I were seeing it for the first time.  The author took the time to build the story in layers so we would know what drove these individuals and feel their anger while each took a stand for their lives.  The history leading up to the battle and the battle for retribution after contributes so much more to the story than I've ever read or watched.

Besides the Series itself, the Author did a great job bringing out the personalities of the players and the coach...many real characters!

Lott is a skillful writer.  Her insights are deep and beautifully expressed.

He is an extremely talented author who has the ability to keep a person wanting to read more.  This is not my typical type of genre but I could not put the book down once I started reading.The book is action packed but also takes the time to describe each character, allowing us to understand how and why they react as they do.  I found myself wanting each family to succeed in their quests, whether it was building a mafia empire or trying to protect the United States from the criminal influence.  This book does an excellent job of showing us what post-apocalyptic America could look like if put in the wrong hands.",5,0,734,0.169,0
1457,"I have been watching Dave Rubin for years now and have kind of a feel for who he is and I wanted to see what kind of book he would produce.  Dave occupies the unacknowledge and poorly understood middle ground so lacking in politics today.  When I was young the Republicans were known as the command and control party and conservatives were famous for wanting to run our lives and control our media.  They wanted to restrict music and video games, although those in the Democratic party like Tipper Gore wanted in on that.  Today things have flipped and the greatest calls for restrictions on speach and thought are coming from Democrats.  The real battle here in not between R and D, it is between those who want freedom and those who want control.  Dave articulates this position extremely well and this is a book I plan to give to some friends who think I am far right at the same time I am just a little to the right of Dave on abortion and to the left on drugs.  I don't think many people occupy the extremes, most of us take different positions on different issues depending on our personal experience and knowledge.  Many of us, like Dave, when we see hard evidence that opposes our views change our positions.  I know for sure that my positions on many issues have changed over time.The book is an enjoyable read and easier than many books, but there are parts I plan to revisit for more contemplation.  Easy is not the same as lacking some depth. Well done Dave.",5,0,1470,0.113,1

1459,"I received this book specifically to write a review.  That said, I try to be honest and open in all my reviews.This is the third book in a trilogy, but you do not have to read the other books to jump right into the story.Our heroines are going to fight the Nazi supernatural menace at its dark heart.It is set in an alternate Earth that reminded me a great deal of the ""dark materials"" books by Pulman.In ""Creatures of Charm and Hunger,"" the Diabolists (the side we are rooting for) have personal demons that aid them and grant them insights and capabilities.The two heroines, Jane Blackwood and Miriam Cantor, are proper ladies, but they are willing to get their petticoats dirty for the cause of light and good.The maggufin comes when Jane's parents are kidnapped by the eeeeeeevil Nazis (are there any other kinds?) to be used in foul experiments to create an occult superweapon to allow Deutschland Uberalles.Off the girls go in a flurry of occult practices, world traveling, swordplay, and derring do.One twist that I found interesting is that the society of diabolists,  the Société des Éclairées, represents the good guys in a Sabrina like twist.I found the style of writing to be nearly synonymous with that classic of supernatural period pieces ""The Werewolf Gate"" by E.C. Lisic.  There were the same allusions, diction, and affectations that made reading that book a unique experience.Some will love this book, and others will find it a tad taxing.Your mileage will vary.",4,0,1481,0.155,1

1466,"This is a very pleasant romance that readers of this genre will enjoy.  It begins with one of the main characters, Judith Pierce, returning home after her wife of 8 years leaves her for a younger woman. Judith has wrapped herself up in her ex-wife’s life and has lost her own identity.  She returns to her hometown to lick her wounds and decide what she is going to do.  Her parents own a winery in upstate New York, and she opts to work in the tasting room until she “finds herself”.  The other main character is Taylor Winslow, a woodworker who makes furniture and custom cabinetry.  She has had a crush on Judith since the 10th grade but never acted on her feelings.Judith decides she is going to play the field by registering with an online dating service.  Over the course of dating, Taylor and Judith rekindle a friendship and Taylor agrees to be her wingman.  Because Taylor wants to have a forever relationship and Judith just wants to spread her wings, this new arrangement seems to work—until it does not.The characters are well developed, and readers will find Judith and Taylor to be relatable.  However, the plot was not surprising, and I felt the pace was a little slow at times.  Much of the story in the second half seemed to revolve around the action in bed instead of moving toward the ultimate culmination.Readers will find The Last Place to be a satisfying book to pass the hours.

1467,"Wow. I am a retired Hebrew teacher from a Christian Bible College.  I have a B.A. in Jewish Studies, an M.A. in Old Testament and Hebrew and a PhD in Biblical Archaeology.  I have a number of books traditionally published on Hebrew word studies.  I have studied the Word of God in Aramaic, Hebrew and Greek for a minimum of three to four hours a day for the last 40 years.  You would think this dusty old professor would not have anything new to learn.  Wrong.  Dennis Prager proves that the Word of God is a well that’s never runs dry and that the Jews are the chosen people of God to bring an understanding and knowledge of the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob into this lost and needy world.  Prager introduces knowledge and wisdom from Jewish literature that is untapped by the Christian community.  The Jewish people are truly the guardians of the Biblical Hebrew as well as knowledge of the Old Testament.  Christians get off your high horse and taste of the wisdom and knowledge that our Jewish brothers and sisters  have to offer. If I find you in a book store looking to purchase one of my books I would tell you to first search out Prager’s commentary.  Zechariah 8:23.  This is what the Lord of host says: In those days ten people from all languages and nations shall grasp the robe of a Jewish man and say: “We will go with you for we have heard God is with you”.

1470,"First off, it is very difficult to publish short stories or novellas.  Readers generally want the full-length novel.  If you look closely, even among the top writers, you will find that their short story collections are generally not published by their 'regular' or 'top' publishers.  Don Winslow is, obviously, an exception.  Why?DW is now one of the top (as in top 10—Ellroy, Burke, Connelly, Deaver, Kellerman, Crais, et al.) American crime novelists.  He is also an ambidextrous writer; he can do comic, tragic, epic, local color. . . you name it, he can do it.BROKEN is basically heaven for genre readers.  DW returns to his many strengths (the lore of the border, the world of the SoCal surfer, the feel of San Diego and its denizens . . . ) and adds an homage to Elmore Leonard, Steve McQueen and Raymond Chandler.  In ""Paradise"" he reintroduces us to Ben, Chon, O and two very special mystery guests from the DW pantheon.Each story stands on its own; they can be read in any order.  Each is different in tone, from laugh-out-loud funny to utterly heart-wrenching.  Each of the stories is strong and they are so different that it is difficult to pick a favorite.Like most novel readers I prefer the full deal to the short story or novella, but when the book arrived I could not set it aside.  Once in I couldn't let go.  This is an absolute must-read for all DW fans and the perfect introduction to his art for a new reader.Feast on it.",5,0,1443,0.092,1

1481,"Alexander Rose skillfully interweaves the colliding stories of Germany's Hugo Eckener with the U.S.A.'s Juan Trippe.

The melding of the two is successfully handled so that by the end of the book, it is pleasurably more like reading a novel than nonfiction, and yet everything is backed with meticulous research.Many books have been written about the Zeppelins, and many books have been written about Juan Trippe's Pan American Airways.  Having read most of those books and having written one of my own, I was afraid of confronting material that had already been worn bare.  The book was quite a delight, presenting new information and insights not seen before.  I learned while being entertained by Rose's new direction in joining these two men together.

1482,"It is 3/12/2020, a date that will now go down in the history books as one of biggest stock market drops in history.  Black Monday 1987? This is now Black Thursday 2020.I'll cut straight to the point.  The crux of the author's advice is that you can retire early if you save enough to the point where you can live off of your returns from investments.  The author essentially assumes that your investments can typically grow at a rate of ~6% per year, meaning if you had a million dollars saved up you could begin withdrawing your savings to the tune of 3-4%, have 2-3% left over for growing through re-investment while simultaneously continuing to save and earn side income if needed.  There were stories in the book of people thanking the author for explaining this strategy, with claims that they were now 'retired' young with only about $800k in savings that they project will continue to grow over time with enough growth (using the 3-4% withdrawal rate and 2-3% reinvested).The major flaw here is the assumption that the markets *always* go up year after year. The author does admit in parts of the book that he may be a bit biased because he's only ever lived through a historic bull run from 2009-2019.  While the author does offer some tidbits of strategy to hedge against financial downturns, they will woefully prepare you for a dramatic crash like the .com bubble, 2008, and now the historic crash of 2020 due to the corona virus.Where are all of these financial wizards now that the market has crashed and it looks like the economy may tailspin into a significant recession?  Many people have now literally watched their savings get chopped down 10+% in a single day, and over last two weeks their portfolios have probably sunk by 25% or more.  If you tried this strategy, stuck with a 3-4% withdrawal rate, yet had massive negative returns like we are now experiencing, you'd be significantly damaging your savings. Plus, the fact that you considered yourself 'retired' probably means you have significant gaps on your resume which will hurt you badly if you needed to get a job now that the economy has tanked and you have lost significant amounts of money on the market that may take years to recover.Just be aware that all of the advice in this book is biasedly written from the POV of a younger person who has virtually never experienced a significant economic downturn as an investor that wiped out half their savings in no time.  Well, as of 3/12/2020 it looks like the party is over, the bear market has arrived, and we've just witnessed one of the greatest crashes in Wall Street's history in a single day.  I shudder to think how many people got torched trying this strategy because they assumed the markets only ever went up, made assumptions that downturns are usually brief, and that their investments should automatically grow at at least 6+% per year.  Look at them now.  Beware of survivorship bias.

So, I expected this to be a self-centered, grandiose exaltation of all things Seal.  It is not.Instead it is good solid down to earth observations, recommendations and real life philosophy.  It exposes what Crenshaw calls the ""outrage culture,"" and he nails it!  The outrage culture is not only a leftist, liberal, Marxist concept.  Crenshaw shows how conservatives are guilty of the same motivation.  He does not trumpet himself as the model warrior against the outrage culture.  Instead, you learn of his defeats, his bad decisions and his own struggle against joining the outrage culture that he so despises.However, the book is more than a cultural/societal/political essay.  It is 100% about how to live to be successful, how to raise your children, how to conduct yourself in order to win the moment, wind the day and win the battles a person faces.For me, after I got about 4 pages into the book, I had to grab a pencil in order to underline keep thoughts, phrases and ideas. By the time I was a chapter in to the book, I was fully engaged, making notes, and observations.  It inspired me to make changes in my daily habits and my world view.  I journaled many responses to his thoughts.  I will be reading the book again.  I will be gifting copies to those whom I know will be shaped and helped by the book.",5,0,1485,0.11,0
1490,"Shayna Darby receives a horrifying message that no one ever wants to hear - your sister is dead, come to Paris. For Shayna, this is not the first time death has arrived with no warning.  Her parents died in a terrible car wreck just three years ago.  She and twin sister Angela have been estranged ever since.  Full of regret at not having mended their relationship, Shayna travels to Paris to retrieve her sister's belongings.  Imagine her shock when, after arriving in her sister's apartment,  she finds a message written in a secret language that only twins can decode indicating that her sister is alive and that she should trust no one.To me, that shocking beginning was the most enjoyable part of the book.  The long reveal of several imbedded mysteries almost caused me to lose interest.  Every person Shayna meets must be regarded with suspicion because they fall into that rather sweeping category of ""no one"" that can be trusted.  Of course, she does rely on locals for help.  Is she associating with the wrong people?  If her sister was targeted, will she be mistaken to be her  by a killer who will try to finish the job?One group of readers for whom I can enthusiastically recommend this book would be for lovers of Paris.  Shayna's sister was researching the Catacombs, which lends a macabre setting to much of the action.  Other famous venues came into play, including the Sorbonne, The Cathedral of Notre Dame, and the Eiffel Tower.  Throw in some cafes and a brothel tour, and readers will enjoy a tourist's whirlwind journey through the City of Lights.  Far from fun,  Shayna's stay is nothing but dangerous from the moment she arrives.I grew frustrated with Shayna's lack of detective skills.  I guess I am spoiled by the unrealistic sleuthing abilities of the characters in some of the cozy mysteries I read.  If readers can hang in until the end, it got pretty good. I was surprised at who was behind the murders and what the motivation was.  I was a little underwhelmed with the rationale for the sisters' estrangement, but it explained how their failure to communicate complicated their lives unnecessarily.  I will read other books by author Elle Marr.",4,0,2176,0.103,0

1494,"In Human(Kind), Ashlee Eiland eloquently shares the experiences that shaped her as a black woman living in a predominantly white world.

Her journey to the present shows how expectations, fears, and insecurities are instilled upon us through the words, symbols and actions of others; blinding us from who we were created to be.

A veteran retail executive, he gives a tight picture of the trials in the retail space , the collapse of the middle, boring, and mediocre and the strengths at the ends of the retail spectrum.

1497,"This book is well organized, written, and researched; a scholarly work in every sense of the word.  So why did I rate it as a “2”?  Because it did not meet my expectations, partially gleaned from an advertisement in one magazine and a review in another.  Let me explain using the author’s words:  • Part 1:  PAST (pages 11-200).  After a multi-page presentation of Smee’s work, the author states: “Although Smee is now forgotten by all but a handful of historians, and he had no influence on our understanding of brain function …” (p. 79)  That’s a good description of 60-70% of Part 1. I’m not a historian.  • Part 2:  PRESENT (pages 201-365).  The author introduces this part by stating:  “In reality, no major conceptual innovation has been made in our understanding of how the brain works for over half a century.” (p. 203).  The chapters that follow review specific topics, like memory, for the period from 1950 to today with each chapter proving the accuracy of the introductory statement.  • Part 3:  FUTURE (pages 367-390). “It’s hard to predict how we will eventually come to understand the brain, and what that understanding will consist of.” (p. 369)If I’m remembering correctly, the “Cat in the Hat” explained how to find things that were lost stating that the process involved  “finding where they are NOT”.  This book finds what the brain is not but gives the reader little hope for a breakthrough in discovery in the foreseeable future.",2,1,1451,0.061,1
1498,Jen Hatmaker does not hold back in this book and her vulnerability is so appreciated.  She speaks from her own experience and things she has learned throughout her life.  There are certainly things that will resonate for every woman.  She explores how everyone is created with unique gifts and attributes and should learn to celebrate those and not seek to change how they are wired.  It's a message that certainly needs to be heard at every age.  Her writing is so relatable through every day stories and her humor.  It would be a fantastic book for any small group or to read with a friend.  I bought another copy right away for my BFF.  It's a challenging book that is so important.

The hero and heroine were likable, but they often made choices that seemed out of character or almost non sequitur.  The storyline was interesting, but it just didn’t meet expectations, and too many loose ends were left dangling.  Some might make it into later books in the series, but who knows.There were some very good plot points, and interesting secondary characters, but everything just felt a little two-dimensional.  Except for the H and h’s lovemaking.  That was very poignant.  And the subject of spousal abuse was handled well.",4,0,728,0.203,0
1500,"“DEAD ON THE VINE” by Elle Brooke White is the first book in the A Finn Family Farm Mystery series.  It’s the delightful story of Charlotte Finn.  After inheriting her great Uncle Tobias’ farm, she becomes the typical “Green Acres” character – going from Penthouse to produce farm.Charlotte meets up with her two BFFs, brother and sister team Diane and Beau Mason, accompanied by Mrs. Robinson, a lady bug that came along for the ride.  Their plan is to go out the farm, check it out, and then putting it on the market.  On arriving and meeting the caregivers, Joe and Alice Wong, a cute little pig endears himself both to Charlotte and Mrs. Robinson.  Charlotte, having a great talent in giving animals their proper names, names him Horse, because he eats like one.  The trio of Charlotte, Horse and Mrs. Robinson become a team.From day one, Charlotte is hit with the intense feelings between the Finns and the Averys and rumor of the possibility that they are not only related but may have a partial claim on the farm.When a dead body is found in the tomato fields with a pitchfork stuck in him, the bad news puts a damper on the prospects of finding a buyer for the farm.  Everyone pitches in to fix the place up with thoughts that by the time things die down in the rumor mill that they can get people to think of produce and not murder.  Part of the renovations include getting the old pond fixed up and filled up not only to increase the value of the place, but to have an access to water in case of a fire for all the local farmers around and to bring back the place Charlotte has such fond memories of.  In the process, Charlotte finds the farm expert, Samuel, who she nicknamed Farmer Brown, friendlier than the harder to read hot and cold opinion she had of him earlier.Charlotte, Diane and Beau all end up falling in love with the farm and the peace and tranquility it brings.  They get excited about opening up a country store, having a You Pick ‘Em part of the farm, and having an event venue like for the upcoming fund raising event for the fire department.  Can they turn around a farm that is on the brink of bankruptcy? Will it be enough to convince Charlotte not to sell?Who had the motive to kill Marcus Cordero?  What was he doing on the farm?  Is the rumor true that she may be kin to the Averys?  Do they have a claim on her farm or will her relative’s will hold up?  Will Charlotte’s amateur sleuthing cause her physical harm?  Can Charlotte teach Horse how to communicate so he can reveal what he knows?  Who beat Serge and is it connected to the murder?  Will a truck fire lead to disastrous damage?  Will knowledge of childhood hatreds bring question to Charlotte about Samuel?  Will profit skimming be enough reason to commit murder?  Will they be able to set a trap to catch a killer?DEAD ON THE VINE is an amazing cozy mystery and a wonderful way to start a new series.  Elle Brooke White did a fabulous job in writing a story that will have you guessing and second guessing whodunit while following the clues as your turning pages on this mystery.  It was fun that while trying to figure out who murdered Marcus, you were also trying to figure out if Charlotte could possibly be related to the vastly different characters in the Avery clan making it a mystery within a mystery.  Love the way she put personality into the animal critters from Horse, the pig, to the real live horse.  DEAD ON THE VINE was a delightful read from the first page to the last.  I would highly recommend it to anyone that loves the cozy genre, loves a good clean read or just loves a great book!",5,0,3602,0.177,0

Now its twenty years later and Grace is home and meets Bobbie again after the rancher brings a hurt puppy into the vet clinic Grace is working at.  Old feelings burn bright, but Grace has secrets that could destroy any chance at love for the pair…I liked this story and it was good for a first time.  It was sweet and let’s face it, who doesn’t love a cowgirl and a vet?  I liked watching the women reunite and work on healing past wounds while dealing with current problems.  The feels were all there, love, angst, anger, happiness etc.  and the sexy bits…oh wow… yeah! I felt like the story could have been a bit better though.  Grace’s mother never cared for her so why Grace would move in with her after moving back to town was a mystery to me, even if she just stayed a few days till she could find other arrangements but to stay when the woman treats her like sh*t and has caused such anguish for her… I hated that part.

There is more than one murder to investigate and some are connected.  When Angela’s friend Carlos is arrested, she uses her skill to determine who is guilty.

1503,"Like so many families, ours deals with the severe mental illness of several family members, and so I was very drawn to this book.  It tells of the Galvin family and their twelve children, six of which eventually develop schizophrenia.  Robert Kolker does an amazing job of telling their story with compassion and truthfulness.  With such a large family to write about, it would be easy for him to have the children blend together in the reader's mind, but this never happens.  Every single family member's unique story is told, and though this, we see vividly all the different ways the disease affects not just those who get it, but those who live with it in the family.We also get a history of the search for a genetic cause of schizophrenia, and how the Galvin family was in a unique position to help this search.Most of all, the book clearly illustrates the tragedy this disease brings to lives, lives that are just starting out in adulthood, and the human potential it takes away.  We see how little drugs help, and how few treatments there are, and how hard it is for a parent to balance caring for their ill children with caring for the well ones.I hope this book gets a huge readership. It is said that one in 100 people are schizophrenic.  However, unlike such disorders as autism, schizophrenia seems to be often in the shadows, almost unspeakable, feared.  I hope this book helps change this, and I thank both the author and the Galvin family for their parts in telling their story.",5,2,1493,0.163,1

Everything is easy to follow and if you aren't experienced with your instant pot, there's an introductory chapter for that, too.  My only complaint is that all picture are black and white.

1509,"Thank you to #NetGalley, the publisher and the author for providing me with a digital copy of this book in exchange for my honest review.  How to Pronounce Knife by Souvankham Thammavongsa is a collection of fourteen short stories about the lives of a Laotian immigrant family as they struggle to find their place in America.  The book is a thoughtful, eye-opening book about how difficult it is to assimilate a new country's customs into the way of life that you are used to.  In the title story a daughter is supposed to read a story at home and get help from her parents with words she does not understand.  The word that is giving her trouble is knife.  Her father is helping her but he does not know that in America the ""k"" in a word is sometimes silent so he gives her an incorrect pronunciation.  When the daughter returns to school the next day and mispronounces the word, it is embarrassing.  It seems like such a small, insignificant moment but it really is much bigger than that.  Something like this can have a profound effect on a child, making them shy away from speaking because they do not want to be embarrassed. This book is full of those small moments, sometimes funny and sometimes painful, that have unforgettable consequences.  This book is beautifully written and I hope the author will write another book of stories or, better yet, a novel.  I highly recommend this book.",5,0,1395,0.149,1

1520,Keto Cleanse: 14-Day Plans to Reset with a Clean Ketogenic Diet PaperbackThe first thing that caught my eye about this book was how well laid out everything is making it very easy to follow especially if you’re new to a ketogenic diet or just want a reset.  There are easy to understand explanations about why a clean ketogenic diet works and what it does to different organs of the body.  I really like that the preparation is really broken down into exactly what is needed to complete the cleanse successfully and there are a lot of easy to follow and prepare recipes.  I am glad I got this book.  I am using it every now and then as my go-to keto cleanse plan.,5,0,663,0.205,0

Written in a down to earth, humorous and accessible style with skillful use of contemporary psychological researchalong with Buddhist principles, the book has a lot to offer readers of all ages.Full of helpful advice — seeing the good in everything, speaking the truth, practicing generosity, kindness and integrity — it offers a valuable recipe for skillful living.Coming from their own very deep, rich practice and personal experience it’s a good read witha lot of useful advice no matter what one’s age.I recommend the book highly and plan to give copies to both my granddaughter and grand niece.",5,0,751,0.379,1

Sue Monk Kidd gave Jesus a 21st Century version of the wife she thought he would have.  In the beginning mother Mary mentions that Jesus was always ostracized by the town because of the strange details of his birth.  But it is never explained just what happened to cause this ""pariah"" attitude.  Monk throws in some ""coincidences"" which eventually wind up as parables, and presents a character who appoints himself as the Messiah, and willingly goes to his cruel death.  About the only redeeming grace of this book is in the camaraderie of women and how they care for each other.",2,0,707,0.059,0

1524,"Enchanted (Accidental Billionaires #4)I am voluntarily posting an honest review after reading an ARC copy of this book.  I am such a fan of J. S. Scott.  Her stories and character development is exceptional.  Each book has you on the edge of your seat.  You can bet there will always be HOT, steamy scenes, and at the end of each book you will let out the breath you didn’t even know you were holding, and you will always have a smile on your face.  Each book is absolute perfection.I could not wait to get my hands on Enchanted because I knew Noah’s story was going to be fantastic, and it was!!  Enchanted (Accidental Billionaire’s, book #4) tells the story of Noah Sinclair, the eldest Sinclair brother.  Noah has always been all work and no play.  Noah’s journey begins with a promise he made to his dying mother.  This promise set the rest of his life in motion.  His siblings appreciate all that Noah has given up for them, but they are settled now, and want Noah to live his life, but Noah does not know anything else, so all the siblings decide to send him away on vacation.  Andie has been Owen’s (the youngest Sinclair brother) best friend since they were children.  Andie had a rough childhood.  She always looked up to Noah.  She now works as a travel blogger.  Owen has asked her to join Noah and she is to make sure he does not work and has fun and relax.  Andie is hiding something, and Noah wants to know what it is.  When I found out what it was, well, I never saw that coming.  That is all I am saying because you must experience Enchanted without spoilers.  I absorbed Noah and Andie’s journey in one sitting.  It was truly amazing how they each learned how to live life.  I definitely needed tissues for this book.  I highly recommend Enchanted (Accidental Billionaires, book #4).  Each book is a standalone, but I suggest starting with Ensnared (Accidental Billionaires, book #1) because the characters appear in each book and you will know who they are.  Set a little time aside also because you will most likely not want to put the book down until you are finished.  Thank you J. S. Scott for another amazing, absolutely beautiful book.  I cannot wait for Owen’s story!",5,0,2192,0.198,0

It's not actually a mystery -- we know who did it -- but it is a toss up for who should win, the dying vigilante or the terribly flawed detective.It constantly tugs the reader both ways.The writing of this is superb.  There is no superfluous description or the waxing and waning of description.  The focus of the story is exactly on the story.  That makes the events all the more brutal.I am not going to do a book report on what happens.  It is in the book description and all very clear.I hope there are more books.

There are themes of domestic violence and general violence, but I think it talks about it in such a way that it's a spring board for deeper conversations and not gratuitous.

We all want punishment for those who were part of the Nazi regime and hurt countless millions.  But this made me stop and think, did the people really believe what they were doing or were they doing it because essentially they had no choice and would end up being the hunted.

There are definitely some deep issues dealt with, but they are handled in a respectful and honest manner.  The thing I loved most was the friendship between Grey and Diana and the way it helped them both to learn so much about themselves and grow as people.

1531,"A Child Lost is #5 of Michelle Cox's Henrietta and Inspector Howard novels.  We are in the Chicago area, in the mid-1930s.  I have missed a couple in this series, but this novel stands alone very well.  Months after their European honeymoon was interrupted with the death of Clive's father, followed just recently by Henrietta losing her baby at just about 2 months PG, we are again with Henrietta and Clive in the wing of his family home as they both try to interweave their own lives. Added to the mix, Clive is taking on his father's role in the family business, both of them are working to get their private investigation business off to a good start, and Henrietta still mourning the baby that might-have-been and keeping in touch with her sister Elsie and the Hennessey family who practically raised her.  Without much effort on their part, the two find themselves with two investigations added to their frantic-paced lives.A friend and former co-worker of Clives with the Winnetka police department has a job he needs to be done, investigating Madame Pavlovsky, a fortune teller,  who might be hypnotizing her subjects and having them bring in treasures which they will then give to her.  If Clive and Harriette can solve that problem for them, the force at Winnetka will be pleased.  It is certainly not considered something they would handle themselves, but they are getting grief from a politically connected constituent.And then a big challenge - finding the four-year-old child Anna Klinkhammer- daughter of Elsie's friend Gunther's friend Liesel, who lived in the boarding house in Heidelberg run by Gunther and his English mother after his father was killed in battle.  Gunther was a student at the same university that his father had taught at before he was conscripted, and upon his graduation, Gunther was also teaching there.  Liesel, suffering postpartum depression, slips away in 1931, determined to find her lover who has since immigrated to the United States.  She left Anna in Guenther's mother's care, meaning perhaps to come back for her.  They received one letter saying she had found work at Mundelein in the Chicago area, and then nothing more from Liesel.  Three years later, Gunther conveniences his mother to immigrate with him and Anna, to get out of this war zone and start fresh in a free country. Unfortunately, his mother does not live to see the end of that voyage.  Gunther winds up in Chicago begins his search for Liesel.  Anna is heartbroken and missing Gunther's mother.  Though Anna will not remember Liesel, Gunther is committed to finding her and reuniting mother and daughter.  As he soon discovers,  Mundelein was a very well-liked and respected Bishop in the Chicago area, and many many things are named for him. Streets, buildings, a city, a college, a seminary...  Gunther soon finds work as a janitor at Mundelein College, hoping to find Liesel, but he has no one to care for Anna while he is at work, and so she must spend the week at a nearby orphanage, then home with Gunther on his days off.  But Anna disappears after having a seizure while at the orphanage.  She was transferred to a hospital and released from there, but Clive and Henrietta have trouble finding out whom she was released to - and against all hope, it was to Dunning, The Chicago State Hospital, a notorious asylum for feeble-minded and insane persons. This is the same place, they soon find, where Anna's mother Liesel died after an electric shock treatment for her latest seizure.  It seems Anna inherited epilepsy from her mother.And in the world of 1935, epilepsy was considered the work of the Devil...",4,0,3631,0.112,0
1532,"""The Lost Orphan,"" by Stacey Halls is a poignant story of Bess, a young girl living in London in the 1750s who is forced by poverty and circumstances to surrender her newborn daughter Clara to an orphanage.  She saves money for six years until she feels that she can support the girl.  When Bess returns to the orphanage to retrieve Clara , she discovers that a woman pretending to be herself had picked the child up the day after she was born.  This is extremely mysterious, because Bess had been required  to leave a special token that no one else would know about that would serve as an authenticating identification should she be able to return for the child.  To learn that someone else had been able to describe the special token and provide other personally identifying information about Bess was a development that  left me gobsmacked.Hall tells the story from the alternating viewpoints of Bess and Alexandra, a wealthy widow with extreme agoraphobia.  Other characters include Bess's financially struggling father, her alcoholic, ne'er-do-well brother, and Alexandra's household servants, her daughter Charlotte, and family friend, Dr. Mead. Almost anything else I can say about the characters might provide spoilers to a plot that is not as obvious as the title might imply.  As a matter of fact, I challenge readers to ask themselves this question after they finish this enthralling book:  ""Who is the lost orphan?""  I think I know.

1533,"This is a must read for all shamans, witches, wizards, seers, seancers, ghost busters, shape shifters, AI dreamers and SciFi fantasists, paranormal explorers, psychologists  and others who need to understand the depths of consciousness  they are tapping into.  However, this is not New Age fluff.  Richard Grossinger has a PhD in Anthropology with an authoritative knowledge of  psychology, biology, physics and cosmology.  He has published 30 books on this and related subjects since 1970.  In Bottoming Out The Universe, he asserts that understanding and exploring consciousness is beyond the reductive materialism of contemporary science.  Consciousness is beyond science. He says:  ""...I range among considerations of animal consciousness, artificial intelligence, paranormal phenomena, the relationship between biology and meta-biology, algorithmic logic (science's rules for the evolution of the universe since the Big Bang, which guard against metaphysical effects or divine interference), personal identity and multiple identities, space colonization and more.""

Dr. Mark Bertness provides such an escape by digging deep into reality...our natural history, our biology, and our tiny place within the vast universe.  As he says in his preface, he continues along the trajectory set by writers like Jared Diamond and Yuval Harari.  Though Bertness has spent his career doing ""hard"" science and writing for other scientists, he's written this book for the reasonably-informed lay-person as well as for his peers, and has done a bang-up job of holding our interest while driving home the succinct thesis of his title: ""Why a Balance Between Cooperation & Competition Is Vital to Humanity"".  There's nothing abstruse here;  in a few hundred pages, he engages us with historical vignettes, artwork, and speculations about our past and future.  He looks at politics, fairy tales, religious mythos (and how psychedelics likely played a role), ancient migrations, spices, and the arrogance with which we abuse nature.

I have never read any of Jen Hatmaker's other books, nor have I listened to her podcast, so I came into it with no expectations.The book as a whole felt flat to me, with not many personal stories to draw me in, and nothing that really grabbed me.

I do like that the author is trying to empower women, and helping them find their own voice, but felt it could've been handled in a different way.

It also includes portions of his SEAL training ...BUDS....and the manner in which that affected his life.  But, he also states how important it was to be raised with a 'work hard' ethic and make his own decisions from an early age.  So, a cumulative effect for him.A couple of the portions that were exemplary for me....One was the explanation of the people in Afghanistan and that cold, hard look in their eyes.  Just imagine living in a country that has had war for over 3000 years...He does discuss the IED that led to the long road back to returning to a SEAL team... This portion was so poignant to read as he described his journey from the explosion to his recovery...Believe....despite what the doctors tell you...That belief was instilled at an early age when his mom had cancer for so many years...Never complain....hold true to your beliefs.  This was a foundation for his exemplary time as a SEAL.As for the current state of America, the 'outrage culture' is described in detail.  This part afforded me a much greater understanding of what is going on in our country these days.  Yes, we all know someone who engages in this type of behavior on Facebook or other social media but the author explains the reasons these people are taking part in it.

He also states that culture  should be 'grit, discipline and self-reliance'.

The reader will be able to distinguish the traits of a good leader versus one 'not so good'....Paraphrasing a few other quotes from his book: Challenges are also important in our lives...Happiness is ours to pursue....You have control over your thoughts.  We, as individuals need to care for our family, our friends, our community and our country.' If not me, then who""?

This series has taken an odd, double-place in my reading diet.  To steal phrases from Pop Culture Happy Hour, for me it is both pop culture comfort food and, occasionally, pop culture junk food.My ultimate piece of pop culture comfort food is the original Law & Order series.  I love the structure: body, quip, police stuff, trial part 1, twist, trial part two, credits.  This series follows a similar pattern—there’s a body, Sebastian is told to not interfere, Sebastian interferes, we see Gibson, Hero is out doing social work stuff tangential to the case, Jarvis looms, Sebastian has to fight and shoot people, the mystery is solved.Unfortunately, though I have read all fifteen books I can probably only tell you the plots of… five of them? The plots of books 1, 3, 12, 14, and 15 I remember, but the rest settled on my brain and dissolved like cotton candy (Stephen Thompson’s textbook definition of pop culture junk food on Pop Culture Happy Hour).

1555,"Brought to you by OBS Reviewer DanieleAuthor C.S. Harris’s writing and storytelling abilities never cease to amaze me.  I think she is one of the greatest historical authors writing today.  With this fifteenth installment Who Speaks for the Damned, the long running Sebastian St. Cyr mystery series maintains its spot among my favorites.Nicholas Hayes, convicted of murder some twenty years ago and thought dead, returns to London with a Chinese child in tow.  However, the risk he takes coming home proves fatal when he is murdered.  Before his death, he had reached out to Sebastian’s valet Jules Calhoun claiming he might need his help so, knowing no one or the city, the child turns to Calhoun, and Calhoun seeks Sebastian’s help in solving the case.As I mentioned above, I truly adore this series and its characters.  Who Speaks for the Damned is poignant and hits home for Sebastian since Nicholas’s life and experience could have easily been Sebastian’s own experience had he not been able to clear his own name when he was accused of murder (book one – What Angels Fear).  Justice runs through Sebastian’s veins, and he is noble and honorable.  I love that he bucks the system time and time again in his quest for the truth.  His wife Hero, who is intelligent and righteous in her own right, is featured quite a bit in this tale, and she and Sebastian make the perfect pair.  Readers learn quite a bit about Calhoun’s past, and he, too, plays an integral role in solving the mystery.  The child Ji is heartbreaking and fascinating.As always, there are plenty of historical facts, politics, and intrigue woven into the story, and though world leaders have gathered in London to celebrate Napoleon’s defeat, there is no single historical event that facilitates the story.  Longtime readers might be a little disappointed, as I am, that there is not much progression with the series long arc regarding Sebastian’s family.  Nonetheless, the mystery is engaging and a tough puzzle to figure out, the atmosphere and period details authentic, the dialogue smart, and the writing superb.Who Speaks for the Damned is one of my favorite reads of the year.  Highly recommended.",5,0,2174,0.164,0
1556,"Not having read the previous installments in the Knights of Fury MC series had me concerned that I might feel left out when reading this book, but since MC-themed romances are my obsession I forged ahead wholeheartedly.  And what I found was an enjoyable tale, a bit predictable a time or two but no less entertaining courtesy of an appealing main couple.  Bartender Abbie has led Temper on a merry chase for five years of him asking her out and her saying no...until the one night where she says yes and which takes her on an exhilarating motorcycle ride away from danger and straight towards HEA.  From the first page to the last theirs is a sizzling journey, with a few speed bumps along the way, that kept me frantically turning the pages to see where fate took them next.Abbie’s an immensely likable heroine.  She was once on her way to becoming a lawyer before her mother’s health issues had her running the family bar instead.  She’s set her dreams aside in order for her sister to live her own life and is the caretaker to a mother who doesn’t appreciate the sacrifices she’s made near enough.  Abbie’s just going through the motions of living, putting everyone and everything ahead of herself, except for those rare nights when the sexy biker Temper comes calling.  He’s given her a chance to break out of her shell over the last five years and she’s said no...until the night she throws caution to the wind in saying yes.  What starts off as a regular dinner out soon ends in a hail of bullets and blood.  To keep her safe though Temper brings her fully into his world and from there she discovers an untapped well of inner strength that made her the perfect addition to Temper’s world. Being with the men and women of the Knights of Fury brings Abbie newfound confidence, makes her a strong support to Temper, and I enjoyed seeing the weight of the world lifted off her just when she needed strength the most.Temper’s truly a temptation when this story starts, giving Abbie a glimpse of freedom whenever he shows up at the bar and I can’t imagine how hard it must have been to tell him no so many times. Temper’s a bit older than Abbie but has no problem making me drool as he exudes sexiness.  Below that is something even more appealing...a kind and caring heart that’s easily on display when he’s with Abbie. Though he wants to impress her on their first date, he’s left no choice but to kidnap her to keep her safe after she sees something she shouldn’t.  I thoroughly enjoyed the dichotomy of control and kindheartedness surrounding Temper, found him and his actions decadently delightful.  He and Abbie were a match made in heaven and the longer they were together the more formidable their pairing became in a story full of exciting twists and turns.On a whole this was a very satisfying read with a good balance of steam and suspense.  Abbie was a likable heroine who grew stronger with each turn of the page.  She made a new life for herself amongst the members of the MC, found a new family who unconditionally appreciated all that she was, and her personal journey had me cheering.  Temper’s a dirty white knight with a hidden heart of gold whose connection to Abbie jumped off the pages and had me holding on for dear life, both in and out of the bedroom.  While this storyline is nothing new, it was presented in a way that pulls readers into this couple’s world, from the exciting drama to the appealing secondary characters.  Into a genre that’s already a bit crowded, Ms. Fernando has nicely set up shop with this exhilarating ride into the sunset that has me waiting to see what comes next.",4,0,3618,0.229,0

She must intervene when a distant cousin wields dangerous magic to change the lives of two unsuspecting young people... one of whom might just be a witch herself.Frances Allington has used her wiles and witchcraft to claw her way out of poverty and into a spectacular marriage with one of New York's wealthiest new tycoons. She is determined to secure the Allingtons' position amongst the city's elite Four Hundred families by any means necessary -- including a scheme to make a glorious aristocratic match for her headstrong and reluctant step-daughter, Annis, using the same strange power with which she ensnared Annis's father.To save Annis from this dark magic, Harriet reveals to her Frances' misuse of their shared birthright and kindles in Annis her own nascent powers. Together, Harriet and Annis must resist her stepmother's agenda, lest she -- and the dashing young lord she suspects she could come to love -- lose their freedom, and possibly their lives.My ThoughtsThe good, the bad and the ugly side of power is explored within the pages of this story.One families struggle within that reaches through time and space, affecting not only it’s members but those friends and the enemies they come in contact with as well.A tale of the Byshop/Bishop witches that spans lineage stretching back a full century to first woman who bestowed her talents, one Bridget Byshop, one side practicing the light and one side practicing the darker magics of witchcraft.In this particular story we actually follow along with Frances (Bishop) Allington, her older cousin Harriet Bishop and young Annis Allington as their paths intersect and lives take different paths.Frances grew up in poverty and want while Harriet by contrast grew up in a loving home wanting for nothing, which of course leads to conflict between them that is mostly of Frances’s making.The truth of their struggle also unfortunately involves stepdaughter Annis Allington and the young impoverished English lord that her stepmother decides is the families ticket to societies full acceptance.However as good versus evil has in every book I have read what actually happens is quite different than what was wanted, by both sides.A story of family secrets and inherited family magical powers that spans generations and is rife with love lost as well as gained.[EArc from Netgalley]",4,0,2868,0.138,1

1561,"Enemies to Lovers is not always a slam dunk for me - it is hard to get past the nastiness and my personal view on life is that when people say things when they are mad you get a clear picture what they really think and they don't get a pass on the ""I didn't really mean it, I was just blowing off steam"".  Here the mad part of the story is funny and awful and necessary to the HEA all at the same time - because this pair really has no idea of what the other is thinking.The book starts with a prolog that includes the first date and the blush of new romance and then jumps straight into the dysfunctional cohabitation and engagement which quickly blooms into the war of the Roses - or rather the war between Nicholas Rose and his intended Rose-to-be, Naomi. In some ways it is sad that we don't get to see much of what made them ever want to marry each other and come in at the point where their relationship has devolve into something apathetic on the surface with simmering resentment underneath all wrapped up in a total lack of communication and set aflame by  Nick's Mother-in-Law.  (She is truly horrible - snide, and backstabbing to Naomi and manipulative and controlling to Nick and his dad.)Because we start at such a bad time in the relationship and at a point where Naomi is at the end of her rope, it is a bit hard to warm up to the pair at first. They both behave really badly and it is hard to see any kernel of once or future love in that behavior - I probably should be ashamed that I found some of that humorous, but I did.  That said, around half way the author does somehow manage to turn things around and does a pretty decent job of setting up the friends to lovers part of this second chance story, which did bring me around to wanting the pair to have the HEA I wasn't sure was possible or deserved.So even though this was a bit slow to get rolling, I did end up really enjoying You Deserve Each Other and I will certainly be watching for more from the author.This is an unpaid review of an ARC received via NetGalley.",4,0,2042,0.108,0

The proceeds from the race will help pay the medical bills for little Aine Bryant.  The event gets off to a bumpy starts courtesy of Vince Paxton and his magical pranks.

She has been running herself ragged since she broke up with Marcus.  Her health is in jeopardy and Dr. Dennis Goodwin has some shocking news.  To top it off, Dorothy Hansel Dewitt is attempting a coup and the only person who can save the village from her reign of terror is heartbroken Harper.  Can Darcy conjure up the killer before her suspects fly off?To Catch a Witch is an enchanting cozy mystery.  It is well-written and has a steady pace which makes for an easy to read story.  Heather Blake has created delightful characters for A Wishcraft Mystery series.  Darcy has embraced life in the Enchanted Village.  She is now running As You Wish, gotten engaged, a wonderful stepmom to Mimi, takes care of their numerous pets, is the Craft investigator, and helps her friends.  Darcy has a caring heart and does not like to see anyone hurting.  She has also taken to rehabilitating Vince Paxton who found his Craft too dull and has taken to dark magic.  If Darcy can turn Glinda around, then Vince should be a piece of cake.  There is a humorous scene with Aunt Ve and Archie that involves Magnum PI and Pina coladas.  Two of my favorite characters are Pepe and Mrs. P.  They are just adorable, and Pepe is a wizard with a needle (I would for him to craft me a dress). The author was creative when making up the magical abilities for her series.  They are unique along with the names.  The Enchanted Village is a charming small town outside Salem.  Each shop is special and suits the owner (no big box stores in this hamlet).  If you have not read any of the previous novels in A Wishcraft Mystery series, I do not suggest you begin with To Catch a Witch (you would be missing out on the backstory that is needed to understand the characters and the magic).  Each book in the series builds upon the previous one.  I thought the mystery was spellbinding and multifaceted.  There are several suspects with motive to kill Abby plus it turns out that Abby had a few secrets of her own.  There is active investigating and I appreciate that Darcy works with the police to help solve the case.  Nick is happy to have her assistance and just warns her to be careful (Nick is a sweetie).  You will need to be clairvoyant (or a master cozy mystery sleuth) to solve Abby’s murder.  I could have done with less repetition (I do not need to be told the same thing multiple times), but that is my only grievance. To Catch a Witch is packed full of intriguing storylines, and it will keep you riveted until the very end.

Slowly, as the years passed, Heather became more determined to look from within and to reinvent and find herself and not give up on her relationship with Jon in the process.

""Starborn and Godsons"" is everything I could have hoped for it to be, other than a waypoint on the path to a fourth or even fifth book.

Brilliant work, of exactly the caliber that long standing fans know that these authors were capable of.  Proof that even after a brain tumor and a stroke, Jerry was still one of the most brilliant minds in SF, with universe building and storytelling skills in the vein of H. Beam Piper.  Larry was one of the very first SF authors I read, at a time when I did a *lot* of reading to escape the real world, and has stuck with me over the decades since as one of my very favorites.  Steven was a later addition to my circle of adored authors, but his work is no less marvelous.  (I particularly enjoyed the Aubrey Knight novels.)

Some are written quickly and in my opinion somewhat superficially, but there is a handful of authors who actually put some effort in writing theirs.  My favorite one is by Connie May Fowler ""Lydia and Jack"", perhaps because it strikes the cord with me personally.  Author reflect on what it means in a society to be a woman who makes a decision on not to be a mother.  Social scientists have determined that there are three reasons on why a woman is not a woman: he either was too old by the time she wants to become a mother because she found a right partner later in life.  Some have biological barriers as to why they cannot be a mother. But there is a number of women who simply decide (regardless of the fact that they may have a life partner) not to be a child by their won choice.  The decision is typically frown upon by society but since the decision is typically very personal. women in this category a typically unapologetic about their choice.

1578,"I had the same thought as another reviewer: this was the book I needed/wanted when I was a teenager.  Admittedly my teenage years are behind me now, but this book came highly recommended and I had to check it out. I was absolutely not disappointed.  The characters are well thought out and developed, the plot is engaging from the first page to the last, and it was one of those books that you find yourself going back to in the days after you finish it, remembering all sorts of bits and pieces that intertwined through the story.  I devoured this book in three days, a feat I don't think I've accomplished in years, and it is absolutely staying on my bookshelf to be read again.  Every page had me wondering what would happen next, and by the time the book came to a close, I felt like I had learned life lessons and had been filled in the way I always hope a new book will fill me when I pick it up.I especially appreciated how the author intentionally included discussions not only of misogyny and barriers women face in comedy, but also included varied family structures in our world today, issues of tokenization of people of color/LGBTQ people/etc in comedy and the world, reminded the reader that people in power aren't always right, and allowed for the realities of exploring and navigating romantic relationships as a teenager and the risks and joys these experiences can offer.  The diversity of  meaningful topics addressed and intertwined in this book is deep and  thought provoking, while still allowing the reader to follow the story line for the joy of reading an exciting and engaging novel.Based on the content of this novel, some people may think it's ""for girls"", but I certainly challenge that idea and would say that while the main character is a girl, this book falls solidly into that middle ground of ""young adult books for any gender"". This book presses any reader on how to be a supportive friend, and more importantly, a strong ally for others, and also reinforces to the reader what it looks like, and the consequences there can be, when you choose to look the other way.  And the main character, Zelda, doesn't just let everyone off the hook at the end, when a lesser book could have left the reader with a weak or disappointing conclusion.  Unscripted's  conclusion is powerful and satisfying and thankfully does not default to a ""simply and cheerfully resolved"" direction.  (that is all I'll tell you now, you'll have to read it for yourself!)The depth of this book exceeded that of many YA books, and requires the reader to consider issues they may not otherwise be exposed to, in an engaging and accessible manner.  I would recommend this book to anyone. Everyone has something to learn and gain from it.",5,0,2738,0.203,0
1579,"I highly recommend this book.  The Truth About Us delivers some hard-hitting messages but in a light, humorous manner that is somehow both deep and conversational.  Every single chapter caused me to first think about people in my life who NEED to read this, and then slowly, realize that I needed to hear it first.  For example, I'd start with a laugh at a title like ""Seven Billion Italian Stallions"" and then I'd read on to digest statements like ""It's remarkable how i can vacillate from self-incrimination to self-righteousness.  Maybe I don't even vacillate.  Maybe it's simultaneous. Maybe the self-incrimination and the self-righteousness feed each other.""  One moment I am smiling, and the next I am pausing.  For someone who sometimes pursues perfectionism, or wonders about their worth, this quote is one of many that really touches on some of those internal insecurities...  ""Humility means you don't have to fear failure.  There simply isn't so much at stake.""  This book was so helpful to me personally, and I'd love to use it in a small group study as well.  It's quick and easy enough to read once, and then slow it down to digest it more deeply.  Again and again.  Brant Hansen's books have really prompted hours of discussion and thought in my own circle.  I bought several copies of Unoffendable and Misfits to give as gifts, and will be doing the same with The Truth About Us.  Excellent book.",5,0,1412,0.221,0

I do agree with one reviewer about Kelly talking to a border line abusive husband.  She is not an expert in that field and it is beyond belief that she would turn the guy around.  She is not Roy Rogers, either, but the author seems to be taking her in that direction.  Her heroics are becoming a little too much, to the point of being silly and unnecessary.  The trend distracts from the story.  I hope the next book will be an improvement, but if this trend continues, I will probably drop the series.",3,0,657,0.158,1
1582,What an informative presentation of our presidents.  The somewhat “behind the scenes” sharing of the authors who contributed bring out interesting items about many of the presidents that might be excluded from a biography.This book would make a tremendous teaching tool for mid-high or senior high students.  I would require them to read each chapter in the order of their presidential experience.  It would give a little more connective continuity.  More mature readers should enjoy the order of importance format.The excellent discussion of our current president -not yet ranked- was most helpful.

Written in the present tense, sometimes it's hard to keep track of where he is chronologically since the year isn't always mentioned as he goes along, a minor quibble if you will.  For those expecting lots of stats and detailed game and/or playoff series summaries, this is not the book for you, but you get great insight into Erving as a person instead.  However, this is yet another sports biography that neglects to at least include a page or two of the subject's career stats--an inexcusable and puzzling omission.

Remembering formative stories from my own past helped me begin to acknowledge those things for better or for worse that have made me who I am.

1586,"The book was structured around the 5 games of the 2000 Subway Series using story lines from each game as a launching point to go deeper on the history and backgrounds of the key figures involved.  You get to learn a bit more about the players, managers and front office personnel, what led them all to this memorable series and how some of them are connected in their pasts.  The author seemed to do a good job balancing research and new interviews to piece it all together and really made this more about people and stories vs stats and play-by-play.  It will likely interest NY fans more than most, but its a good baseball story about two polar opposite rival franchises that should have even more broad appeal.",4,0,713,0.061,1

It is her poignant relay of life in the present, how to assess the impact of your past, and reconcile it all with the person you are allowed to be in this world – who and what you deserve is the absolute best – that jumps off these pages like moths to a flame.As an African American woman who truly did not discover the hateful world of racism until her late thirties, I appreciate Hatmaker’s ability to convey the plight of managing the shrill microaggressions of inequality.  Coupled with her strong sense of humanity, Hatmaker compels us to love ourselves as we are by choosing growth in the form of self-compassion, to love and respect others and their birth right to goodness in life, and to reject and call out injustice in all its ugly forms (as God’s love is for all people).  As Jen Hatmaker tells us, “Your inmost being is a masterpiece of divine creativity….”  This is my favorite quote.  I come back to it daily.It is a reminder that “God” made us well.Free will is ours to do well with.We can choose to give our own beings GRACE.

It's a rare book that includes the dialogue between the other characters of the story, and also what Georgie & Nicolas are feeling & thinking at the same time, and it all made it so much more delightful, funny and enjoyable.

1597,"Vampire books are not a genre I normally read.  But, with such a fun title, I decided I would give it a go.This book takes place in South Carolina, in the late 1980s and the 1990s, focusing on Patricia and her book club group of women.  I grew up during this time period (not in the South), and immediately felt lots of nostalgia for this time period, when I was a child/pre-teen/teenager, like the children of the women in the bookclub.This book is too scary for me.  More specifically, the last 30% of this book was way too scary for me, especially reading it late at night.  My experience with vampire books is Twilight and Discovery of Witches series (you’d think that last one would be about witches, right, but it is all vampires and time travel), and Dracula.  My experience with horror is … does historical true-crime count as horror? If so, Devil in the White City.  Oh, and Christopher Pike and R.L. Stine (pre-Goosebumps because I’m slightly older than that) in the mid-90s when I was in junior high… I’m going out on a limb here and say that Christopher Pike and R.L. Stine were the YA for my generation, although it is possible my school was weird.  Anyway, post-junior high me does not read any horror at all (and junior high me was probably also scared of those books too) and that is fine.Am I glad I read this book?  Honestly, the time period described is a time period I have a lot of memories of and was during my childhood and teenage years.  A lot of thought went into describing what life was like then and a whole lot of care went into creating likable and strong female characters.  All of this was very well done.Does this book accurately represent what was going on in Charleston, South Carolina in the late ‘80s early ‘90s in regards to how black women and black people in general were treated?  I don’t know, I didn’t live in Charleston in the ‘80s and '90s.  I feel like the female characters are all a lot more “woke” than they might have been back then as Southern white women, but even as written, the racism perpetuated by many characters (basically, not caring about black people and not caring that black children are disappearing or dying and segregated living communities) made me uncomfortable that this is the world I continue to live in.  Yes, I realize this is fiction.Is this horror?  Is it just suspense?  I don’t often read suspense/thriller books, and when I do, I flip to the end and try to figure out what happens when I start to get to stressed out.  I’m not a fan of feeling panicky when reading.  So I did that with this book, and was still a bit scared.  There were probably a lot more suspenseful moments than graphic violence/horror, but, too much for me.If you like a lot more suspense than I do, you might enjoy this book.

It has been four years since her husband, Atlee passed away, and Jennie is content to live without a spouse.  Jennie never told a soul about the type of husband Atlee was and how she can still hear his voice in her head belittling her.  Leo Graber has been in love with Jennie since they were young.  His guilt over his father’s death has prevented him from pursuing a relationship with Jennie or living a happy, fulfilling life.  Nathan Walker is a Mennonite traveling book salesman who has fallen for Jennie.  He visits her farm whenever he is in the area and enjoys spending time with Jennie and the children.  Nathan has been unable to settle down in one place because of resentment towards his parents for their mission work and leaving him behind when he was younger. He is contemplating becoming Amish to be with Jennie.  Matthew Troyer, Jennie’s oldest son, has been moody, rude, sneaking out of the house at night and refuses to discuss what is troubling him with Jennie.  What will it take for the four of them (Jennie, Leo, Nathan, and Matthew) to resolve their issues and move forward with their lives?While Beneath the Summer Sun is the second book in the series, it can be read alone.  You need not have read Upon a Spring Breeze which involves different characters (but in the same community).  Beneath the Summer Sun is well-written and engaging. I appreciate this author’s writing style (makes for an easy and enjoyable novel).  I was drawn in right away and my attention was held until the end of the book.  The story contains lovely characters that are nicely constructed and develop over the course of the book.  They are realistic and relatable as well as the issues that they are experiencing.  I like how Ms. Irvin handled the subject of domestic abuse (physical and mental).  It is an issue that is generally not addressed in Amish novels and the author shows that abuse is not limited to Englischers (as we are called).  I am grateful that the author does not paint the Amish in a picture-perfect world.  The author has a way of incorporating Christian values into the book (light touch).  It flows nicely with the story and does not come across as preachy.  Some of the issues that are addressed are faith, following God’s path for your life, power of prayer, scripture, trust, forgiveness (of oneself and others), love, grace and guilt.  Beneath the Summer Sun is a captivating book that will stay with you long after you finish it.  I am eager to read the next book in An Every Amish Season series which is Through the Autumn Air.

You are also given a look into both sides of the story and realize that nothing is ever as it seems on the surface.  Once you start reading Falling for her Viking Captive you will not be able to put it down.  Prepare to be entranced.Falling for Her Viking Captive is part of a multi-book series called Sons of Sigurd.

1614,"Empires of the Sky is an exceptionally well written work on the history of commercial aviation.  This is the story of the struggle to determine the course of commercial aviation; would it be dirty, noisy, dangerous airplanes or the quiet, stately and safe airships that could, in theory, deliver you to the heart of the city where they could more and conveniently deliver their passengers on new ‘skyscrapers’ such as the Chrysler Building that had such built in capability.This story is told in the struggle between the leading ‘Emperors of the Air’; Hugo Eckner and Juan terry Trippe. It is also the story of the triumph of Pan Am in developing safe, reliable, intercontinental flight, and Trippe’s victory over internal corporate foes.Zeppelins were considered far safer in the 1930’s.  Since 1912 Hugo Eckener’s airships flew 49,000 passengers 1,200,000 miles over 21,000 hours of flight time safely. In 1936 36,000 Americans were killed in auto accidents; 300 airplane passengers were killed in crashes.A key point in this book is the importance of helium.  Helium was a strategic item not just for airships; but also because welding in a helium atmosphere was non-corrosive to light metals which helped improve aircraft safety and performance.  Harold Icke’s opposed its sale to Germany (over Roosevelt’s at first seeming support) and there was a fear in the 1930’s  that it was feasible to build an airship capable of bombing New York and making the round trip back to Germany.  Even Eckner feared this when Icke’s challenged him over his request for the sale of Helium to Nazi Germany “I can give you no such guarantee; in fact my only fear is the same that you entertain.”The book concludes with the destruction of the Hindenburg at Lakehurst; yet the story does not end there.  I still occasionally see blimps (non-rigid airships) in the skies above California; and when in new Jersey near Lakehurst I saw the navy’s MZ-3A;(sold in 1917).This book has superb bibliography and notes, and one of things I learned in reading this book are the reasons why the terms ‘aviators’ and ‘aeronauts’ are quite different in origin and meaning.",5,1,2141,0.083,1

1623,"Giving the Devil His Due is a good retrospective of Shermer's thought and work over the years.  While most of these essays are available in various forms and from multiple publications, it is useful to have them collected, organized and in several instances updated and expanded.  It also highlights one of Mr. Shermer's failings as a thinker and writer, he is prone to oversimplification.  In most of his work he is thoughtful, thorough and insightful. Yet when his topics brush up his predilection for libertarian oriented solutions, he tends to overlook or ignore inconvenient perspectives.  When he discusses the yacht incentive, in which movers, makers and shakers are driven to have a yacht just a bit bigger or more luxurious than their peers, all of society benefits because they are creating the markets and the employment they generate to support their ambitions.  Shermer notes that when a middle-manager willingly works 80-hour weeks in a mundane supply chain job, the whole supply chain is the better for his sacrifice.  He neglects to take into account the toll an 80-hour work week will take on that manager, his friends and other ways they could contribute to society had they the time, energy and security.  Shermer lauds market forces in their ability to extract maximum labor for the smallest wage without mentioning the dynamic of keeping hourly workers just below the threshold that would provide benefits or the difficulty of having to work multiple such jobs in order to make ends meet.  This narrow view carries over into his assessment of public education.  He rightfully lambasts the deplorable state of the American public education system.  He holds up the superior results of private schools as evidence that privatized education will inevitably lead to better outcomes.  Again, he is probably correct for the majority of students.  He does not account for the fact that private schools can reject the most vulnerable, disruptive or highest need students.  These are left to the public system to deal with with ever dwindling resources.  Neither does he account for the growth of public funding of religious education through voucher and charter solutions.  This is a particularly disappointing omission for such a prominent ""scientific humanist"".  I am a fan of Mr. Shermer.  He is an important voice for secularism, humanism and above all rational inquiry.  It is disappointing when he takes a simplistic approach to complicated issues.  He is capable of much, much more.",3,1,2502,0.137,1
1624,"First, let me explain, I like Scalzi and this has some of his best.  Scalzi is best at his dialog.  He also develops really interesting characters.  He's got great characters and they have great interactions.  What's different about this final installment is that it it really isn't as sweeping as the previous two.  It is really just a series of interactions between characters that trade witty banter.  This is the best witty banter that you'll find.There are parts I don't love.  Frankly, not a whole lot happens.  It isn't that it isn't a good book.  It is.  It is that not a lot happens.  There are two switcheroos with characters.  When one of them begins, I was really impressed with Scalzi.  I didn't think he had it in him to do something that dramatic.  He had really invested a lot in the character and the characters relationship.  Then...someone out of the blue...he dramatically changes the characters arc.  I was really impressed.  Of course, that didn't last long.  He then pulls almost the same switcheroo at the end.Heinlein wrote a Comedy of Justice and the Comedy of Customs.  This book is a Comedy of Economics.  Really.  It is.  This is a fully realized world what a fully realized economic model that he spends a lot of time explaining.  It is really elegant.  It is a fully realized and developed universe.  I almost wish he had spent more time really working the big picture.  Not many writers today...or ever...could pull off a fully realized universe entirely of their own creation.  Tolkien, Asimov....the list is short. He's also builter at least two other universes that are outstanding. (Old Man Universe and Locked In Universe.) He could fit in the that crowd in some ways.Should you read it?  If you've read the other two, you're stupid not too.  It does wrap up the story and does a great job setting up a universe that could have other stories.I struggle not giving this more stars.

Feelings of inadequacy and uncertainty surface as Lydia desperately wants a loving and successful marriage but at times it seems hopeless since Samuel is having problems expressing his feelings.

1646,"At last Michael Swanwick has published an anthology of 5 short stories - and 4 intertwined vignettes - of which the latter ST is exclusive to this novella, of the far-future exploits of the traveling con men  Darger and Surplus in a world pushed somewhat back to 19th-century staidness  by a failed cyberwar some centuries prior, although many vestiges of the fallen utopian age - some still quite dangerous - remain.  The first ST, published in 2001 - The Dog Said Bow-Wow.  The second, in 2002 was The Little Cat Laughted To See Such Sport.  The third, Boys and Girls Come Out To Play, was in 2008.  The fourth, Tawny Petticoats, was published in 2014,  and the fifth and final ST in 2020  in this novel is published herein, titled, There Was an Old Woman.  The 4-part vignette, consisting of 2-4 pages each, was published in 2003.  While I was hoping to see the Darger and Surplus stories together one day under one cover, the novels Dancing With Bears (2011) and Chasing the Phoenix (2015) are standalone D&S publications.  My only complaint about this small collection was that at the end of the third ST, Boys and Girls Come Out To Play, a bioengineered recreation of the Greek god Pan compels the duo to leave Greece (where the story is set) and go to the city of Constaninople.  But no story about Constaninople was has yet been forthcoming.  I certainly hope there are more stories of Darger and Surplus, before Mr. Swanwick's inkwell runs dry.",4,0,1453,0.065,0
1647,"This book was fantastic!  Heiress for Hire is part romance and part mystery.  Chase's uncle, a duke, comes to an untimely death and the will surprisingly leaves most of the inheritance to three strangers.  Minerva is one of those strangers.  In his investigation into who Minerva is and what her relationship with his uncle had been, Chase learns that not only does she have secrets in her past but she also decides to investigate the duke's death as she had never met or heard from him in the past.  Both believe that the duke may have been potentially murdered.  Many suspects include much of Chase's family with lots of cousins, aunts and uncles.This book is fun.  The characters are smart and well-written.  Minerva is a strong and independent woman...so different from so many others from that time, whether by choice or not.  Chase is just so likable.  The mystery of ""whodunnit"" was maybe my favorite part and had me guessing all the way to the end.  Madeline Hunter has written a fantastic novel with an ending that invites more to the story.  I very much look forward to revisiting this family and characters again in future books from this series.  I give this book a solid five stars and would recommend to anyone who loves historical romance or mysteries.I received an ARC of this title from NetGalley.

The premise is that we rescue each other, but I would argue that they do far more for us than we can ever do for them.

Unfortunately, in this latest entry in the Daniel Pitt series, Ms Perry has lost the thread of her own characters’ back story.  She has changed up personalities, intellects and general history to fit the narrative she wanted to impart in this book.  I found the first 2/3rds of the novel exceptionally hard to navigate.

Most importantly he helps to distinguish daily habits as a key factor for success.

1657,"DJ Palmer delivers I expect when it comes to a good psychological thriller.  There are elements of deceit, coverup, gaslighting, denials, marital questions, and on and on.  This book builds like a great roller coaster.  It is admittedly a bit slow at the stary as characters are introduced and the scene is set (building off the pages over the last 17 months), but once you clear this initial hill, there are exhilarating twists and turns along the way as the story progresses and the sinister nature of characters is released, slowly.I enjoyed the story.  A marriage is shattered upon the apparent death of the husband (no body found). SIngle mom of two teens finds an unexpected love and future with an unexpected man.  One of the kids struggles with acceptance of the new man in their life, and all of the changes, while the other is thrilled to have the dad he never had with his biological father.  Lots of familial and social situations and drama that is easily understood by the reader.While it takes a while to get there, The New Husband delivers on the promise of psychological drama and all of the twists, turns, and intrigue associated with the genre.  I'm happy to give this 8.5 out of 10 stars.I received a free electronic copy of the book from the publisher and NetGalley in exchange for my thoughts an opinions.",4,0,1326,0.175,0

I started out ok setting up characters, but the never fully developed them.  I persevered until the end and was shocked by such an abrupt ending.  For all the buildup, I was expecting a fantastic fight of good over evil.  It fizzled out with nothing, but a mini battle.

That might be my fault though, which is why I am still giving it 4 stars.  While it is not geared toward beginners, it does a nice job at thoroughly explaining the process of baking each recipe, including explainting the equipment and techniques.  It also nicely categorizes the type of baked goods into sections.  It provides many recipes for baked goods you ordinarily wouldn't think of on your own.

In this book he solves the case instead by using the skills of an experienced detective.  Nothing wrong with that, but it makes him another Lucas Davenport,  Virgil Flowers, or Harry Bosch.  That did not detract from the story, it just made it more routine and less unique.

1668,"Barbara Bush clearly enjoyed  her sessions with the author and participated and shared diaries with trust (well placed) that they would be used appropriately.  Barbara Bush jumps off the pages and we get to know her in a way that is very different than her own penned recollection.  Clearly she was a very strong mother with high expectations for her children and a belief in having a big family.  Being a mother was a priority at the time women were intent on having careers as well as having a family.  Barbara Bush doesn’t regret being a stay-at-home mom, and if she were alive today,  she probably would make the same choice.  Her sharp tongue, however, is something many husbands and children would resent .... she was lucky that they didn’t, or if they did, it didn’t interfere with the closeness this family experienced.  Remarkably she never changed her look, even when people thought she was George H. W’s Mother.  It is unusual  to have no concerns about things like that, especially having been raised by a mother who thought Barbara wasn’t pretty.  Page poses a most interesting question at the end:  would George Bush have been elected without Barbara Bush behind him and so strongly and openly opinionated.

1686,Was looking for  book that discussed moral courage in today's society.  The description of the book made it seem like it was just that.  Unfortunately it wasn't.  It was a long description of the author's time as President of his university and the main example he used for moral courage was Martin Luther King Jr.While I would whole heartedly agree that Martin Luther King Jr. was a courageous man.  I would disagree that his escapades with women and infidelity was anything but immoral.I kept reading in hopes that the book would get better and give the reader some inspiration or examples of courageous leaders but it fell far short of its description.  Would not recommend.,1,1,677,0.202,1
1687,". . . in a fabulous city.Fiona is now the Chairman of the Town Board.  And her nemesis, Stella, bitter after her loss, remains on the warpath.  In addition, her relationship with Pete has hit some bumps in the road.  Ferry captain Pali is considering a job on the mainland, and island newcomers Emily and Jason Martin apparently know (or think they know) everything that is going on in town (except, of course, with their own children).And then, there is Oliver Robert -- another newcomer to the island, hired by Fiona as office help.  Who IS he?  And what is his agenda?For those who have appreciated Ms. Riordan's previous novels, get ready for another adventure with characters you have come to know and love.  I eagerly await book number four -- and I hope that she doesn't stop there!FULL DISCLOSURE:  I read the first novel as a reviewer for Amazon Vine.  I enjoyed it so much that I purchased a hard-cover edition, and the sequel.  I had previously visited Door County, WI on a number of occasions, but after reading these books, I made a journey up to Washington Island.Later, I discovered that the author lived near my church, and upon learning that she was soon to publish this book, I invited her to do a book signing, which was very well received!

A wonderful easy read full of short stories of her time with Patsy Cline and Patsy's effect on her life.It is a celebration of women and an example to women of how we should support and empower one another.It is still beyond me why authors who write about music do not put together a soundtrack to sell with it because as they write about the songs, I would like to hear them.If you are a Loretta Lynn fan, you should love this book.

George is a master of the complex mystery and of characters who will resonate with you.  She's also managed to worldbuild over the years so that readers, like me, look forward to what comes next (especially since there's always a cliff hanger of sorts).

I looked up the products and they seem ok but it’s weird to see brandnames as I’m reading a story.  Hate it when I see a movie doing that crap.- The hero has a friend who’s father is a billionaire, that right there tells me this guy will overcome any obstacle in his way.  So the element of “could he accomplish what he sets out to do?” was pretty much a non question.- The book uses the “censored” gimmick in which some words are blacked-out in order to have the reader think it originally contained Top-Secret information. 🤣",4,0,703,0.175,0

In this book, I enjoyed living vicariously in a bake shop near the ocean through Kate.  Descriptions of cookies and other baked goods added a lot of flavor to the story.  Kate's dog, Oliver, is super cool.  I just wish there had been more about the murder: particularly more clues to potentially allow the reader to solve the mystery.

Although, this novel isn't quite as good as the first, it's still an enjoyable read.  Your favorite characters return to the island to celebrate Mercer Mann's latest book release.  This time, a murder of one of their own occurs and the inept island police force is not a force to be reckoned with to solve such a complicated crime.  So the island's crew of authors takes it upon themselves to figure out whodunnit.  The first half of the book moves fairly slowly but the 2nd half is worth the wait.

1698,"When the Golden State Warriors failed to win a third consecutive championship and fourth in five years by losing to the Toronto Raptors in 2019, it signaled the end of the latest NBA dynasty. How the Warriors got to that stage and some of mechanisms behind their success is told in this great book by Ethan Sherwood Strauss.Rather than recapping the games and playoff series wins, Strauss takes a different approach to telling the reader about Golden State's success.  He concentrates on the business side of the game for insight into the team, starting with when Peter Guber and Joe Lacob were able to take control of the team from Chris Cohan, under whose ownership the franchise became a laughing stock.  What Guber and Lacob did was nothing short of brilliant by not only finding players to complement Stephan Curry and bring out his best, but also how they were in tune with what was going on in professional basketball and how to either lure players (see Kevin Durant) or keep players even it would mean a reduced or different role (see Andre Igudala.)The only player in which Strauss writes about in depth is Kevin Durant and his appearance of being annoyed.  It is a complex situation and not something that is simple as he didn't like being second fiddle to Curry nor just that he wanted out of Oklahoma City and became a target of the rantings of angry fans. In the book, this goes well beyond fans at games – social media and its influence in today's NBA players is examined in depth and is one of the best subjects addressed.Strauss also pulls no punches when he talks about the current state of the game when he writes that the Warriors ""somehow rose up in this atomized, clownish world…"" or about the current reduction in accessibility to the players for the media.  He states that NBA stars are ""merging the aloof with the confrontational"" and that ""walls were coming up.""  This type of writing is the main reason why this book is one that all NBA fans, whether they are saddened or overjoyed at the end of the Golden State dynasty, should add to their libraries.",5,0,2078,0.079,1
1699,Wow!  I've long felt that our criminal justice system was broken and in need of fixing but I thought about it only from the perspective of the inmates and how unfair the system is to them.  The Shadow System has opened my eyes to another dimension of the problem which is the horrible effect incarceration has on the families of those in jail.  The stories are riveting and I can't imagine someone reading without walking away without additional empathy for a population of people whose stories often go untold.

1709,"My writing may seem odd, so… take a deep breath.The RATIONAL BIBLE is the most readable commentary I have ever seen.  It flows.  Reading it is a pleasure.  It was difficult for me to set it down—and it’s a heavy book!  Big print is a big plus, making the text comfortable for me to see, and the unfussy formatting makes the sections of ideas easy to keep track of.  (My book is now full of little stickies.)If you are a Christian, this is a particularly valuable exegesis, since it is not coloured by whatever seminary your pastor went to.  That probably didn’t sound very polite, but it has been important to me to get a Jewish point of view on, let’s face it, a very Jewish book!  I find this commentary indispensible because it is written by someone who has intimate knowledge of the Hebrew language, and has studied Arabic; is knowledgeable about ancient Mesopotamia history and cultures, and has had a lifetime immersion in Jewish traditions and mores.Mr. Prager also has a way of bringing the stories to life, instead of killing them off as with most commentaries.  There are many poignant, even heart-rending moments in the stories and characters of Genesis, and this is not lost in the interpretation.  The most moving of all the tragic figures in the Bible was—a surprise to me; but it’s so obvious after he explains.  You’ll want to read the book to find out who and why.",5,0,1381,0.071,1

I knew this one would be just as great as her others, and I was right!This is an amazing tale of Ana, a girl who grows up to become the wife of Jesus.  It is a novel of empowering women, finding oneself, standing up for beliefs and love.  Back in a time when women were valued as objects and property, not much was written about women BC.  The world was male dominant, and writing the history of women was not a common practice.This is what made the novel so moving, telling the story of ‘what if’ Jesus had a wife?  It’s not impossible given the times and the lack of scribes writing about the life of disciples, and missing time gaps.  Most people believe Jesus was a real person, but who may or not have been the Son of God, and I found it an interesting twist on biblical history.I can’t wait to see what Kidd’s next topic will be!",5,0,1278,0.123,0

I've made tons of the recipes and while I have modified all of them a bit they are strong base home cook recipes for the family.  I haven't made anything from this book yet but it is beautifully laid out with loads of pictures and notes as the first one was.  My one issue and it's a big one is the basic table of contents that does not list the recipes, the first was the same but I was so thrilled to get it I went through it page by page marking everything I wanted to try but it is difficult for every day use.  When the TOC only says things like Breads, Dinner, Desserts...  I have found myself picking up the first less often and this one will likely be the same.  When you want to meal plan or try something new I want to open to the TOC and have a list of the recipes that are in that cookbook.  I don't want to spend forever paging through the books to find what fits my needs at the time (ie something with the beef I have left or the extra apples I have).

And as we sit here missing our friends dearly, she reminds us how important it is to root each other on and that there is room for all of us to flourish in our own ways!

So many things Jen wrote spoke to the deep parts of my heart and mind.  If you needed permission to be YOU, the real, authentic version of yourself...this is it.  You will finish this with a new sense of ""it is okay to speak what you think"" about all of it.  The body chapter made me both sad and grateful.

This is my favorite kind of story -- in that it riffs off of a historical/scienfiic story but then she dovetails it with her own life, including love stories and battles with depression.  It's such a smart and fascinating book that deftly tells seemingly parallel stories that are then magically woven together.

1734,"This graphic novel lays out the history of spying, surveillance, and the reasons behind the voyeurism.  At times, the art style and the message comes off as Jack Chick preachy, but the overall effect is to promote a view of the players and the technology, and that the environment is such that in the present day, you actively have to defeat surveillance as the passive methods are quite intrusive.  The overall message is family friendly and is a good introduction to the issue.

1743,"Mrs. Morris and the Witch is the second title in the Salem B & B Mystery series and drew me back into this world quickly with a lively Paranormal Cozy Mystery to sink my teeth into.This time around we find Charlene with a newly renovated Bed & Breakfast opening just in time for the Halloween craziness that overtakes Salem each year.  She’s planned well, but she didn’t expect to discover a dead body after returning from a ghost tour.  It seems the victim, who really was a witch in more ways than one, wasn’t liked much by a lot of people, yet the person who is the main suspect is innocent and Charlene sets out to prove that.  Along the way she’s going to discover more background on this witch than she’d ever have wanted to know and has to stay one step ahead of the true killer before they decide she’s getting far too close.As a reader who truly enjoys the ride of any Cozy Mystery it’s not my main focus to figure out whodunit but to have fun with the journey… and I certainly did with Mrs. Morris and the Witch.  With enough twists and turns to create a pretzel along with a few red herrings tossed in this story will lead you on a merry chase to catch the real killer.  I’m enjoying getting to know these characters better and I do like the building relationship between Charlene and Sam.  Yet, since there can be really no true relationship with the adorable Jack I certainly hope he soon becomes Charlene’s sidekick in solving crimes… and not a ghostly part of a three-sided romance.In any event, I had a blast with this second story in the Salem B & B Mystery series and would not hesitate to recommend it for readers who love a really good Paranormal Cozy Mystery.

And to think we all thought we were being good parents by making sure our children were vaccinated!  A friend of mine, 20 years ago asked me, ""Why are so many of our kids now suffering with anxiety, depression, bipolar disorder, autism spectrum disorder?  Is there something in the water?"" The answer may well be that pathogens in the animal cell cultures that the viruses are grown in have infected us and our children.  I don't ever remember hearing that viruses were cultured in mouse or monkey tissues; I always thought it was grown in something made from chicken eggs.  As a child growing up in the 1960's and 1970's, I remember lining up in the school gym in the late 1960's  to receive the immunization for Rubella.  Like sheep, we (and our parents), trusted the government mandate that all children be given that vaccine and told that it was for our safety, to prevent a devastating disease.

I liked this Nero although far from the canonical since he's a black belt as well as arm-chair detective.  Thanks, Mr. Pachter, for turning me on to this series of shorts and one novella!I've bought the fun The Man Who Read Mysteries by William Brittain even though only one of the shorts is a pastiche of Nero Wolfe.

1762,"All around masterful storytelling! First and foremost, a tribute to the surviving siblings of a family suffering or, better yet, enduring the infliction of the phenomena of psychosis.  More importantly, it is a searing indictment of bio-psychiatry, and their continued  swatting at windmills  to find the ""gene"" or underlying biological substrate that purports to cause the phenomena.  These ""bio-psychiatrist"" actually package their purported ""data"" and  ""knowledge,"" pass it around seeking to convince universities, themselves and Big Pharma of the existence of a  ""gene,"" and that way, once  the ""genetics"" are determined, poof, the ""disease"" will be cured---thereby deflecting from the impolitic of a certain family dynamic from which it seems to arise or making the family member rebel in his/her own idiosyncratic way---given new meaning to the sins of the parents visited upon their children.  The whole enterprise is geared to avoid the impolitic ""schizogenic parent.""  Yet their is no story absent the parents dynamics, their values, history and self perception and the keeping-up of appearances. It is not to place blame, but the belief that a ""gene"" will override that is equally delusional.  Say what you will about Big Pharma, but at least they recognize the futility.  The problem is that the ""dynamic"" is already deeply embedded way before its effect becomes manifest.  The delusion is that once the gene is discovered, it will override the dynamic, and ""poof"" patient cured.  The take away from this book is psychiatry, as with all their fictitious diagnostic claims, they themselves manufacture a disease that they then seek to cure or falsely claim to have a cure.  Apparently you can make a living doing that.  It remains mind boggling that purported medical specialty is allowed to even exist.",5,5,1813,0.07,1
1763,"Gone With The Rogue is the second title in the First Comes Love series and brings two intriguing, stubborn people together for a romance that will change their lives.  I was easily drawn into Garrett’s and Julia’s story and while I didn’t over the top love this one I did enjoy the time spent I with them.The first meeting between Garrett and Julia was definitely chuckle-worthy as he rescues her from a tree she was rescuing her son’s kite from – rather unsuccessfully.  As a widow firmly under the control of her powerful father-in-law, Julia doesn’t have a lot of options in her attempts to free herself and her young son from the Duke’s influence.  But she does have a plan – and that plan didn’t include the handsome rogue Garrett, yet it seems Garrett has other ideas.Garrett’s and Julia’s romance is quite quick, and although a combination of sweet and sexy the more sizzling moments are fade to black… and there are only a few.  Without giving away more than I want to, Gone With The Rogue is a good story with likable main characters.  I like the idea behind this series of the doomed ship the Salty Dove going down and how that affects the lives of so many other people – and the women who come together to help the young daughters of those who died in the tragedy.  Yet, Julia and Garrett were far too often overshadowed by the actions of the Duke who is really good at hiding his misdeeds and pushing his own agenda on his daughter-in-law and grandson.  So, I liked the story, it moves the series along, but I didn’t fall in love with the characters.  It happens sometimes.  I would still recommend the series in general, and I do look forward to the next story – it’s just that this one fell a little flat for me, but you should make up your own mind.*I received an e-ARC of this novel from St. Martin’s Press via NetGalley.

This book is loving, empowering, funny, and vulnerable, with a healthy dose of Hatmaker’s characteristic snark.  Where she could have chosen to be negative, she instead chose love and grace.  This book is well-researched (and cited) and can be a powerful tool for women to come into their own of who they were created to be.

The cover recipe (little gem salad, smashed cucumbers, shatta (a recipe in itself), and smoked eggplant.  Shatta takes three days to ferment (I kept forgetting to blend it so mine was still fine after 5 or six days), and the smokey eggplant puree is heavenly.  All in all, I think I nailed the cover photo recipe very good!Other recipes I have tried.. Chicken Musakhan, Shatta, and Chicken Shawerma pie were amazing.I have complete a few soft peruses of the book, and other than the dessert section, there is not a single recipe that doesn't scream out to me to make.  Each recipe has a blurb at the start with backstory as well!  As for the sweet section, I just am not a fan of the middle eastern sweets.. rose water, orange blossom water, etc, etc.. so that section will probably be the least cooked from.If you are already familiar with ingredients you're going to need, (sumac, pomegranate molasses, tahini, (lots of tahini), allepo pepper, urfa biber, grape leaves).. then you can jump right in!  Newcomers to this cuisine might need to search out a Middle Eastern market or do some Amazon shopping first!Also, the food photography is just wonderful!I cannot recommend this book enough, now back to cooking!!",5,0,1379,0.067,1

This is another example - I am no fan of 'taming the wild west' stories as I find the hardships those people went through just too depressing.

Germany is still in disarray with people struggling to find food and shelter so it's fairly easy to hide from the authorities with a fake identification card.  Margarete Muller is the fake name that Clara Falkenberg is using to try to return home.

As she returns home to find her best friend, she is also realizing how many people she hurt during the war and beginning to question her actions  She always felt that she had done her best to protect her workers but the world saw her differently.  Was she a cruel inhumane person, only concerned with increasing her family's wealth or was she compassionate and caring and just caught up in family's legacy?

1780,"This was one of those FB suggested reads/ads in my timeline that peaked my interest with the minor cost to possibly start on a new serial of books, and overall an enjoyable read for a dedicated sci-fi reader.  Writing reminds me of the used books I read as a teen, when the publishers in the 60's and 70's cranked out novels on schedules so plots tended to be straight forward, characters were flat(ish) to serve a specific role in the story, and big cliffhangers at the end were common to sell the next installment.  While I am more into world-building/space opera serialized writing now, First Encounter failed to meet my expectations. I did not connect to any of the characters in a meaningful way, and the plotline was simply a path to the cliffhanger at the end.  Other than the details around crew rotations necessary to maintain the colony ship, I felt minimal effort was put forth to build up the world/backstory/reason to care/etc (especially the alien world the ship stops at in the Trappist-1 system).  Props to the author to making the aliens truly alien and being realistic about time of flight  at sublight speed travel.

1784,"This history is an excellent reminder that no matter how inconsequential an action may seem, reverberations from it may echo for decades, if not centuries.  In the normal course of events Marie Caroline, Duchesse de Berry, and Simon Deutz might have lived out their lives without contact, but through a series of tumultuous events affecting them and the entire nation of France in the early 1830s, they became inseparably connected by a scandal. Maurice Samuels' account of that scandal is an entertaining and thought provoking account.Marie Caroline was born a Princess of the Two Sicilies, a kingdom in southern Italy ruled by a branch of the wide flung and highly inbred family network that included the Hapsburgs and the French, Spanish, and Italian Bourbons.  She was married off at a young age to another member of that network, the Duc de Berry, younger son of the man who was to become King Charles X of France.  She spent a few years more or less happily married, but then her husband was assassinated, which meant that her young son became the eventual heir to the French throne.  In 1830 King Charles X was overthrown and replaced with a cousin who became King Louis-Philippe. Marie Caroline became the leader of the legitimist opposition to Louis-Philippe, fighting for the right of her young son to take the throne.  She led a short rebellion, was forced to hide for several months in an attic, and was then betrayed by Simon Deutz, son of the chief rabbi of France.  Deutz had spent his life in one finagle after another, looking for wealth, fame, and prestige.  By betraying the Duchesse, whom he had previously sworn to support, Deutz became a symbol of villainy, and because he was Jewish by blood (he had converted to Catholicism during another one of his schemes) he caused the entire Jewish population of France to come under suspicion and growing enmity, reviving centuries of French anti-Semitism. Deutz's action and its consequence was to help lead to the Dreyfus Affair and the sorry spectacle of French collaboration in the Nazi Final Solution during World War II.This is a remarkably interesting book about two not very interesting people.  Neither Marie Caroline nor Simon Deutz were well educated, intelligent, or particularly honest.  I wanted  to keep reading about them just to find out what mess they would get into next and how they would eventually manage to wiggle out of it, only to land in an even bigger mess in consequence.  But the most important aspect of The Betrayal of the Duchess is to learn more about  anti-Semitism, an evil that is still today a blight upon humanity.",5,0,2615,0.106,0

It is straight-forward and predictable.This book gives us a greater glimpse into the pasts of Daniel and Miriam.  In a poignant scene, Sir Thomas Pitt considers that Daniel's childhood was so different from his own: Daniel went to school and then to university, having never suffered from want, while Pitt -- the son of a disgraced gamekeeper -- began life as a beat cop.  Ms. Perry also gives us glimpses of Miriam's days at university, including an event at the heart of this novel.From the beginning of this series, I noticed that the stories were not as dark or gritty as the Thomas and Charlotte Pitt series or even the WWI series.  Perhaps that is because of the relatively privileged upbringing of the main characters.  Perhaps maybe the UK & Europe during the Edwardian period really believed that war, poverty, and all kinds of other evils were on the cusp of eradication via human progress (a conversation that Daniel has with Miriam certainly seems to imply this belief).

1799,"Autobiographies should do two things, entertain and inform.  Trevor Noah:  Born a Crime does both well.  The author relates several humorous incidents about growing up in South Africa.  One incident regarding his experience being a DJ for a multi-cultural event at Jewish school is particularly entertaining, but like so much of the book, is informative at the same time.  Trevor Noah came of age in the immediate post-apartheid years in South Africa.  Of course, the effects of apartheid lasted long after Mandela was released from prison and elected President.  Trevor Noah’s insights at the ground level add perspective to historical facts.  A theme throughout Born A Crime is the love and dedication Trevor Noah’s mother had for her son.  Love and dedication are what mothers provide for their children, but Trevor Noah’s mother provided it better than most. This reviewer’s copy came with a disclaimer “adapted for young readers”.  There is no profane language, but there is some heart-aching violence, so it is not for every “young reader.”  This reviewer’s copy also came with a short chapter “apartheid history” written not by Trevor Noah, but an anonymous person in school textbook style.

But, Tipsy isn’t completely surprised.  She’s been in contact with ghosts since she was a little girl.  But, these ghosts are different.  First, Tipsy has never lived under the same roof with a ghost.  And secondly, Jane and Henry died in the house as a result of a murder-suicide. In reality, neither one can remember what led up to their deaths, although Jane is convinced her husband killed her, while Henry just as vehemently denies he didn’t.  As Tipsy deals with her well-meaning friends and a vindictive ex-husband, she also tries to determine what really happened the day Jane and Henry died.I simply loved this book.  Charleston Green is a clever mystery intertwined with ghosts, friendships, and family relationships.  The characters are quirky and the dialogue is entertaining.

I did not care for it at all and feel like it does not match her description of Harley.  It does not come close to showing Harley as a a burly bar owner!!I was given a free ARC via NetGalley in exchange for an honest review.,4,0,680,0.258,0
1805,"This is a good story of a woman who has sold her successful bakery in New York City and moves to small town, Hope Lake, PA.  Parker is back with her best friend Charlotte and the Golden Girls, the older women who run the town.  She is also in contact with her ex boyfriend, Nick who has a local landscaping business.  The problem with Parker is she is bored.  She comes across an idea of opening a bakery co-op and the town grabs the idea with both hands.  Of course Nick figures into the equation This is book 3 in the Hopeless Romantics series but is an easy to read stand alone.

1806,"I've only watched a couple of episodes, but I like Dave's show on YouTube and really wanted to learn something from his book.  Unfortunately he incorrectly assumes his decision to switch political parties is the same as having a open mind and keen intellect.  Really?  The primary theme of Don't Burn This Book is exactly what disgusts Dave about the Democrats:  vilification of the opponent.  According to him, all progressives are stupid.  All news is fake.  All so-called liberals are shallow thinkers who automatically go after straight, white men.  Come on, Dave.  You've got to be able to go deeper than that.",1,0,615,0.134,1
1807,"When writing about the sinking of the Titanic or the Lusitania it is commonplace to speak of those disasters as ""the ends of eras,"" referring to the changes in policies and outlooks that took place as a result.  The sinking of the Andrea Doria in July 1956 can be called an ""end of an era""  just as pertinently as those earlier catastrophes.  Greg King and Penny Wilson, whose writing partnership has already produced fine historical accounts of the Russian and Austrian Imperial courts as well as a study of the Lusitania's last voyage, have once again teamed up to depict an old tragedy with great care, even handedness, and sensitivity.The Andrea Doria was not just a ship, she was a symbol of national pride and resurgence for Italy in the 1950s, a nation which had suffered through years of dictatorship, war, and impoverishment.  Beautifully decorated and ultra modern in design, the Andrea Doria pointed to an Italian future which seemed bright with possibility.  The ship was advertised in prestigious magazines around the world and attracted a powerful and glamorous set of passengers on every voyage between Genoa and New York.  Most other ocean liners in the 1950s seemed dull and fusty in comparison, while the newer mode of travel by air was seen as less reliable and much more dangerous.  If you were traveling across the Atlantic, the Andrea Doria was the best choice available.On the night of July 25, 1956 the Andrea Doria was nearing the end of one of its trans-Atlantic crossings, carrying a nearly full load of passengers who included movie stars, politicians, millionaires, quite a few young children, and many Italian families emigrating to the United States or returning from visits to their homeland.  Off the coast of Nantucket Island, just hours away from its planned arrival in New York, the Andrea Doria was struck broadside by the Stockholm, a Swedish liner. Both ships suffered terrible damage, and the Andrea Doria quickly began to sink. The next few hours were terrifying as passengers and crew scrambled to safety, making their way through a listing vessel that was quickly taking on water. Half the Andrea Doria's lifeboats were unusable, and in the confusion and turmoil some passengers were trapped in their cabins.  Fortunately several other ships were in the area and arrived to render aid within hours, meaning that many lives were saved, though the consequences and repercussions of that night were to reverberate long after the Andrea Doria finally sank eleven hours after the collision.King and WIlson have done an excellent job of describing the Andrea Doria as a symbol of Italian national pride, and have gone to great lengths to recreate its final voyage through the eyes of many of its passengers. They were able to locate and interview many of the survivors, most of whom were children or teenagers at the time of the collision, and their eyewitness accounts of what happened that night in the North Atlantic make for vivid reading.  There were many accounts of the disaster and its aftermath printed in newspapers and journals of the period, and the authors have made good use of those as well.  After the ship sank there were the usual lawsuits and recriminations over how blame was to be assigned, and King and Wilson give those a fair analysis, too.  It was also enjoyable to read of the many diving expeditions  to the Andrea Doria and of the artifacts retrieved and brought back to the surface in the years since 1956.The sinking of the Andrea Doria was a symbol of the end of a method of trans-Atlantic travel. Over the next decade or so as air travel became safer, faster, and more reliable many great ocean liners were retired, sold for scrap, or just left to rust.  The Last Voyage of the Andrea Doria is thus a work of social history, documenting an era that ended just a few decades ago, but now seems very remote indeed.",5,0,3881,0.069,1
1808,"This remarkable, compelling work was my proper introduction to the truth about the murder of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.  Philip F. Nelson seems to have left no stone unturned in demonstrating beyond any shadows cast by the guilty parties, their enablers and accessories, that the April 4, 1968 assassination of Dr.  King was approved, ordered, perpetrated and covered up at the highest levels of the U.S. government, beginning with President Lyndon Baines Johnson and FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover, in a plot with roots tracing back several years.Nelson is a bona fide patriot who performed a similar service with his 2013 exposé of then Vice-President Lindon Baines Johnson’s central role in the plot to murder President John F. Kennedy on Nov. 22, 1963: LBJ: The Mastermind of the JFK Assassination.  In ""Who REALLY Killed Martin Luther King Jr.?"" Nelson draws from and builds upon the work of fellow truth-seekers including William Pepper, whose ""The Plot to Kill King: The Truth Behind the Assassination of Martin Luther King Jr.,"" (2016) was especially important to Nelson.“Dr. Pepper’s . . . The Plot to Kill King, stands apart from all others, as the singular tour de force of his four-decade-long investigative reportage,” Nelson writes. “It succinctly captures the essence of the people, events, and timeline of a plot that began its development four years before the actual murder of Dr. King and has then continued on as a still-active cover-up operation for the last five decades.”Others whose books Nelson cites as essential to his “narrative that blends the findings of practically all of the original researchers into a single coherent story line” were John Larry Ray (James Earl Ray’s brother) and Lyndon Barsten’s ""Truth at Last: The Untold Story Behind James Earl Ray and the Assassination of Martin Luther King"" (2008), as well as works by Harold Weisberg, Mark Lane, Dick Gregory, John Avery Emison and Philip Melanson.Contrarily, throughout ""Who REALLY Killed MLK,"" Nelson quotes from the numerous authors -- “the novelists” and “fiction writers” -- whose mendacious works of propaganda have worked to create the completely false picture of Ray as a Southern racist and murderer who stalked King for years that most Americans still hold as truth. “Together, the books written by William Bradford Huie, Gerold Frank, George McMillan, Lamar Waldron, Gerald Posner, and Hampton Sides – and to a lesser extent by others such as Pate McMichael, Stuart Wexler, and Larry Hancock – have formed the foundation upon which the ‘official’ government account now rests,” Nelson writes.  “Unfortunately, that case can be metaphorically compared to a rotting block of aged Swiss cheese, where all the voids represent missing pieces, but the rest of the mass is so contaminated with lies and deceit that is spoiled beyond redemption.”By the time the low-level criminal and designated patsy James E. Earl Ray, who had been “allowed” to escape from Missouri State Penitentiary on April 23, 1967, realized he had been duped, the hellish deed had been done at the Lorraine Hotel in Memphis.  Through sheer luck, Ray, who had been carefully manipulated and positioned a rooming house across the street, escaped the murder scene with his life, but he had no chance to thwart the long reach of the massive law enforcement assets that Hoover had organized against him.We have Hoover’s own words to convict him as the mastermind of the plot to frame Ray.  In a memo to Attorney General Ramsey Clark shortly after their June 20, 1968 meeting, Hoover summarized their conversation, as Nelson writes, “with aplomb and considerable helpings of duplicitousness, cynicism and irony mixed in”:""I said I think Ray is a racist and detested Negroes and Martin Luther King and there is indication that prior tothe Memphis situation,"" Hoover wrote.  ""He had information about Kind speaking in other towns and then picked out Memphis.""Nelson demonstrates through countless examples how the “baseless” lies from the “fiction writers” and the media that spread them contributed to Ray’s “faux legend” as a racist who hated African Americans, and that Hoover’s words to Clark about Ray at such an early date after his arrest, long before “anyone had even evaluated Ray’s persona in depth” or written anything of substance about him, betrayed the truth that the fix was in: ""J. Edgar Hoover has already framed him according to the theme that would be repeated again and again by the chosen authors of books and newspaper and magazine articles,"" Nelson writes. ""It proves that the die had already been cast, and from then on, James Earl Ray was officially christened as a racist hater of 'Negroes' and a stalker of Martin Luther King, both false legends that would endure for half a century.  Perhaps for eternity, if the fifty-year-old house of cards does not finally collapse, and soon.""During his nearly full year of  “freedom,” Ray traveled from Chicago to Toronto and Montreal, Canada; then to Birmingham, Alabama; to Texas; Mexico City, Acapulco and Puerto Vallarta, Mexico; Los Angeles; New Orleans; returning to LA and then back to New Orleans; to Birmingham and Atlanta; returning to Birmingham and finally to Memphis.  After King’s murder, Ray would return to Atlanta, travel to Toronto again, then to London, Lisbon, Portugal and back to London and his final arrest  at Heathrow Airport on June 8, 1968.How did Ray finance this elaborate and expensive schedule?  The House Select Committee on Assassinations, in it 1976 to 1978 investigations, rather than follow the truth about how Ray was financed by his handler “Raoul, or Raul” instead accused Ray of an incredible series of bank robberies neither he nor his brothers could have committed, as Nelson explains:  ""The entire ludicrous story was necessary because they could not countenance what James Earl Ray plaintively, patiently, repeatedly, and consistently stated: that all those funds came from 'Raoul' (Raul), who they obviously knew would lead them to places they did not want to go.""Throughout his extensive travels, nearly every step of Ray’s movements were tracked by the FBI through Raul, and Nelson gives us a front-row seat to watch the intrigue that had only one end game – de facto incarceration for life, without a fair trial, for the hapless Ray.Nelson’s comprehensive presentation of the depth and enormity of the conspiracy to kill King and frame Ray is at once horrible and elegant, and one must read this work of true life terror, page by page, to fully understand and appreciate a story that Nelson might best succinctly describe here:""The enormous combined and coordinated efforts of the federal, state, county, and city officials guiding the effort –and the various geographic districts of the state and federal judiciaries – were focused as only a powerfullycoordinated resolve could accomplish,"" the author writes.  ""The objective was to ensure that James Earl Ray would be denied any  chance, even the outward appearance, of getting a routine criminal trial (never mind a truly fair one.) . . . . The  federally sponsored – and state-sanctioned – cruelly inhumane treatment given to James Earl Ray was nearly unmatched by any other case in American history, with the notable exceptions of Sirhan B. Sirhan and Lee Harvey Oswald.  All three of these cases were comparable to what one might expect to find in German history, circa 1936- 1945, or in the Stalinist era of the Soviet Union.""Nelson brilliantly lays out the demonic methodology employed by the numerous parties in the multifaceted plot -- the FBI, state and federal government officials and investigators, and later the Department of Justice in 1976, the House Select Committee on Assassinations (“a Kangaroo Court Proceeding”) investigators in 1978 and the DOJ again in 2000 -- deliberately avoided pursuing any and all leads which pointed toward Ray’s innocence.Among the most stunning revelations in ""Who REALLY Killed Martin Luther King Jr.?"" is that the “Reverend” Jesse Jackson, long a media darling and designated spokesman for the African-American community, among other things, was himself part of this evil conspiracy, an insider and accessory to King’s murder who will likely find a special place in the lowest circle of hell for his treachery, not to mention a lifetime of deceit, as to this day he lives the lie of his loyalty to King and his cause.As someone who spent more than 20 years researching my own book that fully exposes the sacred cow that is the truth about Amelia Earhart’s tragic death on Saipan at the hands of the prewar Japanese, I recognize brilliant, painstaking research, skilled, patient organization and efficient, effective writing -- and in this book you will find it in spades (no pun intended).  Every statement, claim, quotation or supporting fact that Nelson cites is footnoted throughout this meticulously documented book.The assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.  long ago joined the state-sponsored murders of John F. Kennedy and his brother, Robert, in the pantheons of American Sacred Cows – enormous lies created and bolstered by decades of government-media deceit that has effectively inoculated the American population, with few exceptions, against the truth that poor James Earl Ray, their designated patsy, has absolutely nothing to do with King’s murder.Despite the great work of Phillip F. Nelson and the other fine researchers and authors who have labored long and selflessly to inform the public about the truth in the King slaying, America as a nation of citizen patriots educated to think and discern for themselves the painful truths about their government rulers is long gone, if it ever existed at all.Whatever virtues our culture might once have offered, we now live in evil times indeed, and the truth about King’s brutal execution at the hands of our nation’s highest law enforcement officials means nothing to all but the most perspicacious observers of the passing scene.  Do yourself a great favor, obtain and read Phillip F. Nelson’s book, and join those of us who aren’t afraid to learn the truth.Mike CampbellJacksonville, Fla.",5,0,10133,0.092,1

Ryan (or her alter-ego) for my “cowboy” fix.  I love getting in on the start of a new series, and My Kind of Cowboy introduces us to the multi-generational Merrick family and their ranch in the Wranglers of Wyoming series.  The type of family that built the Mid-west and West ranching communities.  It is that sense of generations that begins this series with a look to the past and how it has shaped the Merrick family in so many vital ways.Worldbuilding is important in any first story of a series, and we get a very strong, emotional feel for the Merricks as we learn how they became a multi-generation family working one ranch.  It’s a strong look at how Brand became the man he is today, stubborn, proud, and always so determined to do things his way or no way.  I fell in love with Brand rather quickly, in spite of his stubborn nature… and could that man ever be bullheaded.  Avery is a delight and the perfect match for Brand.  Equally stubborn in her own ways, she’s a city girl who has serious trouble following her no matter how far away she tries to run from it.  Watching these two stubborn, strong people banter, challenge, reassess each other, and slowly let the attraction between them go somewhere was an emotional, engaging journey.You’ll find fun family interactions, more than a few laughs, some serious sizzle, secondary characters who cry out for their own stories to be told, danger, and a love worth fighting for.  I had a blast with My Kind of Cowboy, and I’m already anticipating the next chapter of the Merrick family in the next book.*I received an e-ARC of this novel from Forever (Grand Central Publishing) via NetGalley.

After a breakup with her childhood sweetheart, Bridget has no intention getting into another relationship, and just wants to do her job.

He is also coming off a relationship with someone who cheated on him, and despite his ex-trying to win him back, he has sworn off any of her attempts.  Matt is immediately attracted to his new boss, a beautiful hot redhead, who is also a bad ass attorney that always wins her cases.  The attraction is immediate, though Bridget is determined to make sure she doesn’t become involved, especially since she is his boss, though in a short time working together, they do become friends.When Bridget is desperate to get a date for the wedding, Matt volunteers to be her date, only as friends to meet the family in Las Vegas for the weekend.

The author is trying too hard to be emotional and artistic.Here is a sample of one page:  Mom, when is the tarte tatin done?  When the puff pastry is light brown & firm & the caramel is bubbling like crazy.  Mom that sounds dangerous.That is only one page of many.  What a crock.

1830,"This was such a fun book to read!  I was fortunate to read an ARC and devoured it on a long snowy evening.  The story takes place in Regency England.  Young Lady Violet Grey finds herself in a compromising position with a much older and experienced cad during the first party of her season.  Fortunately Lord James Audley steps in to her rescue and ends up proposing marriage.  Lady Violet, smitten with the dashing Lord James accepts and they begin a whirlwind courtship and a happy, romantic marriage.  Fast forward 5 years and the pair are barely speaking.  It is apparent that James no longer trusts Violet, and she is furious that he won't believe her.  We don't find out exactly why until much later in the story but its great fun trying to figure it out. Violet is not the typical woman of that time period - instead she has a curious, agile mind and is not afraid to speak up or even dare to laugh in public.  Thankfully, she has a delightful group of friends to support her, as does James. It is one of his friends who dashes off a letter to VIolet informing her of an accident involving a horse that rendered James unconcious.  Violet, realizing she might still have feelings for her husband, rushes to his  side, but is surprised to find James on his way home looking none the worse for wear.  Violet angrily retaliates resulting in a comedy of errors so funny that I laughed out loud many times.Martha Waters writes in a style that easy (and fun!) to read.  The desciriptions of the time are detailed to the point that you feel like you're experiencing it for yourself.  The characters are very well developed - I expected to hear a carriage pull up and prepared to meet them in person.  Anyone would love this book.  It is an excellent first novel - I look forward to reading ( and meeting) more of Walters's creations!!",4,0,1833,0.268,0
1831,"This is a wonderful story!  This is the fifth book in the Scottish Bookshop Mystery series.  This story is about Delaney Nichols, an American transplant in Scotland and a newlywed. Delaney works at The Cracked Spine, a bookstore in her small town.I was immediately drawn into the book and had a hard time putting it down.  Even though I had not read the previous books in the series, I had no problem jumping right in and falling in love with The Cracked Spine.  With the author's writing style, I could perfectly picture the town and the shop and I was drawn to the characters.Delaney bumps into a woman outside the bookshop, knocking the woman's books to the ground.  Delaney stops to help her, and when they look at each other, Delaney realizes the woman could be her twin, only 20 years older.  The woman, Mary, also realizes the uncanny similarities.  Delaney assists Mary to the bookshop and quickly Mary asks Delaney and her co-worker Rosie are invited to dinner that night at Mary's home.When they talk with her further, Mary discloses she believes she is Mary, Queen of Scots reincarnated. The next day, a man is murdered via car bomb, and it is discovered it was Mary's husband, whom Delaney and Rosie thought was delightful when they met him the night before.Delaney's regular contact at the detective bureau is on vacation, so she keeps some of her suspicions to herself.  I really enjoyed this book and felt that The Cracked Spine would be a regular hang out for me, and the characters would definitely be my friends.  I really enjoyed this book, and I didn't even figure out 'whodunit 'until the very end.I would highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a good Scottish cozy mystery.

1834,"I chose this book as my free Prime book for March 2020. Lately,  I've read too many dark books about gaslighting  and crime,  and was looking for some light fare.  This story was mostly light,  with no real surprises or twists,  and an eventual happy ending for the main character.The story was a little slow and  at times bogged down by too much description and repetition.  I found myself skimming a couple of pages here and there to bypass detail that didn't matter to the plot,  or incidents that had already been described.  (Example: The details of Betty's abandonment by her parents were mentioned multiple times.)  I found the character of Marv to be extremely controlling and had a hard time believing that a free spirit like Betty would settle for him,  even if she felt it was her only real option.  I also despised the nickname Betty used when she was older:  ""Boop Peck"" is pretty awful.  Finally, and this is not the author's fault,  this book is not what I'd consider historical fiction.  It's a work of fiction set partially in the 1950s.  I don't know why Amazon classifies it as historical fiction when none of the events of the period really play into the story.Overall,  a fluffy read that doesn't require a lot of thought.",3,0,1243,0.106,1

1838,"I enjoy audio books that are read by the author.  I like hearing, in the author's own voice, what they choose to stress and emphasize.  But it can come at a great risk of getting stuck with several dull hours of listening.  Rubin is a professional comic with thousands of hours of experience speaking in public and on his podcast.  So, we get the best of both worlds in his audio book.Now, to the hear of the matter.  I feel that Dave Rubin and the entire Rubin Report Team, most notably including Dave’s husband, David Janet, have helped take civil discourse to an exciting, provocative and hope filled new level.  The rules of the game have changed.  Eric Weinstein described his experiences with the Rubin Report as “spectacularly non-egoic”.  This new, or most likely re-newed, gold standard of civil discourse redefines “winning an argument”.  In this uncharted “Intellectual Dark Web” or “IDW” (a term also coined by Weinstein I believe), winning an argument is not necessarily the goal. In fact, winners often loose and losers often win. Participants want to hear the very best arguments from their interlocutors.  In the IDW, taking down a false argument may be righteous and smell a lot like victory but it lacks challenge and quickly grows stale and boring. They would much rather catch their own blind spots and weak arguments like flies in the web of this ‘leveled-up’ discourse.  The mathematics of the IDW are elegant and simple: 1+0=1 and 1+1=2.  If you come to the discourse with one opinion and you leave with the same opinion, perhaps you ‘win’ the argument, but nothing substantial gets added to your understanding.  Whereas if you come with one opinion and leave with another you may have ‘lost’ the argument, but in the IDW you just won big-time!  People are hungry for high octane humility.  They are flocking to 2-hour podcasts in by the millions.  If you think this book is just socio-political posturing, wiggle your fingers in the IDW a bit and see what happens.  You may level-up and start climbing the walls.Don’t Burn This Book is a gourmet listen and a wonderful VIP backstage tour of not only the evolution of Dave Rubin, The Rubin Report and the IDW, it is also a front row seat to the rise of the Jordan Peterson phenomena.[If I may add a personal note, I am eagerly awaiting the supernova of ideas that could be caught in the IDW if Rubin et al. load their spinnerets with some high tensile strength silk like that which comes from the mind and soul of GK Chesterton.]",5,0,2502,0.163,0

The Woman's Auxiliary Ferry Squadron or WAFS was developed during World War 2 to find women who were already certified pilots who could ferry airplanes (any that were used in the war) from either a base to a repair station or from the United States to Britain.  This was still the early years of aviation and these ladies from all different life situations (housewives to university graduates) were independent, strong, and gutsy.  They relieved men who could be then sent to the front lines.  Their stories are riveting, and their life afterwards interesting.  They were never given military status but considered civilian employees.  It was not until 1977 when many were in their 80's and 90's when they finally received military status and given benefits that should have belonged to them from the beginning.I highly recommend this book to any of those interested in World War 2 women's service, and the pictures that are at the beginning of each chapter highlight the women.**I received a complimentary copy of this book  from the publisher through NetGalley.

1849,"I enjoyed the thoughtful approach to storytelling, as well as a good summary of many great philosophies viewed through the prism of Mr. Crenshaw.  This book is one part biography, self-help, psychology, philosophy of self, wrapped up with many interesting tales to help the ideas come alive.  It was nice to see stoic's get there due in a culture that seems to worship emotion.  It's as if a dysregulated amygdala now is somehow seen as the ""authentic self"" or even worse ""truth"".  This flies in the faces of decades of psychological research, and millenia of history of nation states and cultures.Ultimately this book was number one, very entertaining.  I was glad that this didn't devolve into a political book (beyond some pushback vs. leftists/sjw's), but kept focused on trying to flesh out the notions of self-actualization, goal setting, productivity, and living a better life that one can feel proud of, no matter how imperfect.  Some say everyone has one great book idea, I think this book clearly hits that mark.

I tried 3 projects, one from each chapter.  The cup (ch 2 The Easiest) and it was very easy to do.  The directions were super easy to follow.  I did cut my paper to 8in by 8 in before I started.  the Bowtie (ch 3 The Easier) was my second one and it requires a rectangle piece of paper.  I first tried it with just a piece of 8.5x11 copy paper and that did not work out well so I cut another piece of copy paper to 8 in square then cut that into a 4x8 rectangle.  That worked great and the the bowtie was much easier that way.  It was harder than the cup but it was easy to follow the directions.  My last attempt was the Dress (ch 4 The Easy-ish) and it was a total fail.  The directions were just as easy to follow but I became super frustrated because the folds are much more difficult to make.  I think the chapter should be titled the challenging not the Easy-ish.

I loved the prior book, Triple Jeopardy, and didn't think the series could get any better.  Man, was I wrong!  This story was absolutely riveting.  I hope Daniel, the progeny of Ms. Perry's beloved characters Sir Thomas and Lady Charlotte Pitt, and his friend Miriam fford Croft have many more adventures to come.Young lawyer Daniel Pitt is approached by a teary young woman whose lover has been accused of arson and murder.  The medical examiner states the young man who died was bashed in the back of the skull which resulted in his death, not the fire.  Daniel takes the case and discusses the death with his friend Miriam fford Croft, a scientist and the daughter of the Head of Chambers of the law firm where Daniel works.  She believes a former teacher of hers, Sir Barnabas Saltram, who is now a renowned forensics arson expert  - with whom she had a stormy history - can testify on behalf of the accused.  Miriam approaches him, he agrees, and Daniel wins his case.  However, when another young man is killed in a fire eerily like the prior one involving the same sphere of people, Daniel begins to believe his forensic expert may have been wrong...This was a fascinating story which actually involves three murder cases.  Daniel, Miriam and Sir Barnabas were all compelling characters, fleshed out with strengths and foibles.  Sir Barnabas morphed from being a cold and superior forensics expert into a sinister player in the cases.  Daniel is coming into his own as a lawyer, instead of being mainly known for who his parents are.  His friendship with Miriam is both strong and tender; is there something else there?  It was Miriam, however, who shone the brightest here.  I loved learning more about her past, her relationships with her father and Dr. Ottershaw (her mentor) and her struggle to be a scientist in a time when women were thought to being incapable of handling such responsibilities.  There is another powerful character here not previously mentioned but which everything centers around:  fire.  Ms. Perry perfectly showed the incredible power of fire and taps into our primitive fear of same.

I am reminded of the statements I discovered in Louise Penny’s Inspector Gamache series — “I am sorry, I was wrong, I don’t know, and I need help.”  I have used these 4 ideas as a guide in my medical school teaching and leading of young faculty.  This book takes me deeper into understanding, relishing and discovering my direction in life.  I recommend it highly.",5,0,615,0.17,0

It’s a great resource, and study guide; the descriptive context and linear thought pattern is why I’ve purchased multiple copies.I’m Christian and love the step by step march through the Old Testament.We’ve gifted these to my Agnostic friends, who like the moral arguments for universal truth.We’ve gifted these to Mormon family, who loved both reasons given above (emphasizing one of their ‘aha’ moments in the correlations between justice and mercy).These are great books (even the cover looks good!), and I thank Dennis for his efforts in print, radio, and video.

""Murder in the Storybook Cottage,"" like the rest of Ellery Adam's works, had enjoyable characters, an enjoyable setting, and an enjoyable plot.  This one had a little bit more with a terrific tease at the end.  I never thought it would be possible, but that tease makes me look forward to the next in this fun series even more than I ever have before.  Until someone does build such a wonderful place like Storyton Hall, I'll have to settle for visiting it in my imagination through these wonderful books, as well as everything else this author writes.",5,0,644,0.256,1
1864,"Reviews of the previous book, Murder in Red, noted the snide comments between some of the main characters, which were out of place.  This book is no different.  In fact, it began to really bother me.  Jon Land has changed the characters too much and not in a positive way.  Jessica, Mort, and Seth did not always agree on everything, but they didn't constantly antagonize one another as they appear to do in this book.  I'm not really looking forward to reading the next one, and will probably not continue with this series.

Acclimating to life in Coral Cay, Florida has soothed her soul and she is now a partner in the local bakery, life is good.  Helping her best friend build some planting boxes, she and Maxi take a break and the island’s dog, Oliver, helps out by digging up bones.  Not just any bone, but those of what appears to be the bones of  Gentleman George, a legendary Pirate that was said to have called Coral Cay home.Maxi is excited about the discovery, but it turns out the bones are not that of the pirate, but have been planted in the past year.

There’s a whole lot going on in Coral Cay as Kate’s ex fiancé arrives in town trying to win Kate back and the tourists descend on the island for the annual pirate festival.

Think Fright Night and Lost Boys!But, this is Hendrix.  That means there's a sly sense of humor mixed with our very graphic horror!Our book club is entertaining, our horrific scenes are very scary (especially one), and there's a bit of social horror as well  - our Book Club wives start out a bit Stepford and must confront the truth about things like race, class,  and domestic abuse, all while dealing with a truly monstrous...monster.I loved this.

Very clever the description of things that would, in our time, be obvious but a hundred, two hundred, hundreds of years be less obvious.  Magic is only technology you don’t understand — never better captured in a story than this.

Yes, she's right- there is a special place in hell for women who don't help women.  This doesn't btw mean that women who vote for men are condemned.  It's aimed at the mean girls (you know who they are).  Albright, a deeply serious woman has a sense of humor not only about the world but also herself.  She's committed, she's thoughtful, she's set a great example - and she's willing to let a little air out of the balloon.  Thanks to Edelweiss for the ARC.  An excellent read.",5,1,642,0.262,1

You could actually hear the bugs and smell the flowers.  Anne Aletha’s  spunk and steadfastness in her beliefs.... a difficult thing to be true to in that era... endeared her to the reader.  Much was happening in the country and the South during this time, and the author included these events without boring the reader.  Just enough romance to make her even more real.

Anyhow the following details are some of the tidbits contained in this Financial kindlebook: the author’s employment/money background that shaped his career, money, and personal life evolution. Although the author does have some employment history in the  Washington D.C. area he builds a persuasive case on why looking at the location of where a person resides is a significant piece of the puzzle, the cost of housing, ways to live rent-free while still maintaining some semblance of independence/freedom (please know that I completely understand that for some people it makes sense to live with family members if you are close to them/get along with andor they live in an area of a strong job market), the author covers transportation costs and the three expenses covered in that category, the art of travel-hacking, the author explains what he means by current market value and some ideas for a person to eventually raise/increase their current market value, separate short term and long term investing goals, the author explains about a sep ira, the author’s chapter on real estate investing, the author mentions what he is communicating in regards to daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, annual habits and more.",5,0,1844,0.127,0

In fact, it seems like the author combined ideas for two books, neither of which was adequate for one.  The Cooke family sub-plot--Victorian paterfamilias, wicked stepmother, Lizzie Borden-ish axe murders--reads like it was set in 1850, not 1950 as is claimed.  Setting it several generations before the primary action could have worked.  The main story line isn't as anachronistic and, with additional background, could have stood alone.  As it is, I felt I was being jerked back and forth between two centuries.",3,0,628,0.097,0

He treats his subjects and characters respectfully often displaying a level of depth and nuance, especially in Adre and the Carthage locals, that most political novels lack.  He does an excellent job depicting small town America without relying on tired stereotypes of the south.  Life and people are nuanced and the author does a good job of fairly discussing the issues, albeit satirically.A great book regardless of your views on politics and money.

Amos Decker - Memory Man is probably our favorite Baldacci character.  However this particular novel wasn't up to the typical Baldacci/Decker standards.  It was a snoozer that plodded along and seemed similar to a Japanese movie where everybody dies in the end, (i.e. create a suspect, kill off him-her, rinse, repeat).  Most Decker stories are hard to put down.  This Decker story was hard to push ones-self to even finish.  Hopefully the next edition will be back to Decker standards!",2,0,616,0.097,0

I have no major interest in fashion,  but I have great interest in people who study, learn, have the elan to be brilliant and the best in the world.  Congratulations Mr Talley.  You are a hero.

1882,"Ross Bridgeford has apparently been coaching people for many years.  He has no health credentials that I can find and is, apparently, self-taught or self-professed.The purpose of this book is to guide you through 7 days of vegetable juice, vegetable smoothies, and vegetable soups as a cleanse.  There are no solid foods during this week.  In addition, Ross presents a plan for 7 initial days to prepare your body and mind for this reset.  You have to wean yourself away from sugar, meat, dairy, coffee, fruit and gluten.  I would suggest the weaning process might take more like three weeks.I came to this book fully aware of the alkaline style, having read and followed some of the guidelines in Dr. Daryl Gioffre's book, Get Off Your Acid.  Pretty much you can google for a chart of alkaline foods, which are mostly vegetables, especially green leafy vegetables, some starches like quinoa and sweet potato, and nuts and seeds, and guide yourself.Personally, I think any program that guides you to a new lifestyle of eating whole foods that are plant based will help to make you healthy.  You can check out Dean Ornish, Michael Greger, Alan Goldhammer, Caldwell Esselstyn, Neal Barnard, Joel Fuhrman,  and many more, all of whom will give you information about a plant based diet.  These other docs believe also in salt and oil free food, while Dr. Daryl and Ross believe in adding lots of fat to your diet, coconut oil, olive oil, avocado oil, etc (which are not whole foods, btw).If you are ready for some hard work, then this book might be for you.  If you are looking for a weight loss book, this is not it, despite the claim to rapid weight loss in the title.  This requires a commitment to a lifestyle in order to lose weight and keep it off.Certainly, anyone who is obese, or has high blood pressure, a heart condition,  or is diabetic, will benefit by following any lifestyle that removes sugar, meat, dairy, and gluten from their diets.  The processed foods that we eat as part of the American Standard Diet (SAD) are making people sick.This is not a bad book.  It's just not 5 stars as far as I am concerned.",3,0,2120,0.086,0

Didn't read the two books that were republished, so I don't know if those books changed a lot from the original versions, but in this new book in the series, Cas Russell (the MC) changed from a strong, vital heroine to a whiny, afraid of everything, very non-heroic character.

Becky has been on a journey of self discovery...discernment in Ignatian circles....and took the deep dive into writing a book...and then a second.  The Inner Chapel is her gift to all of us at any age.  This book was completed well before our current world pandemic and it could not be timed better.  Becky is an able guide through the whispers we hear, the restlessness we feel for something “more”.  Becky refers to that space inside ourselves where we can find shelter and comfort as the Inner Chapel.  This book is a guide for anyone who would like to enrich their prayer life...in real life with its simplicity and complexities. You can read it quickly but I would recommend a chapter at a time.  We have time in these days of social distancing.  Savor the gift of time and the guidance offered here.

1895,"Phil Nelson, in his unique writing style, tackles the most egregious and shocking assassination of the turbulent 1960s.  In unprecedented fashion, the author clearly establishes the many strands of premeditated organization sparing none of the entities involved, from the man who drew James Earl Ray into his unwitting participation as the eventual patsy, Raul, all the way to the top, where a familiar nemesis LBJ awaits his unrelenting pursuit of the truth.  In between, we learn of the crucial roles of the despicable team of Hoover and Tolson, ex FBI Memphis Police and Fire Department , Frank Holloman, the Judas Iscariot Jesse Jackson, and of course the media manipulator, novelist and Goebbels-like William Bradford Huie and all of the sycophants that followed his lead.  As the case unravels, Nelson skillfully engages the reader with absolute proof, tying in the excellent previous work of William Pepper and Harold Weisberg, and the heretofore ignored, and in some cases unrevealed because of fear of reprisal, stories of people who saw actual events at St. Joseph's Hospital, at the Lorraine Motel, outside Canipes Amusement, at the Liberto whole sale produce company, Jim's Grill, and other important venues.

But no body has been found, so is Greg dead or has he just taken off?  Simon Fitch, a middle-school teacher has befriended Nina to the point that, nearly 2 years after Greg’s disappearance, they have bought a house and moved in together - Nina is not quite ready to marry Simon but it all makes financial sense.  Greg and Nina’s children, Conner (in high school) and Maggie (8th grade), react totally differently to the new man in the house.  Conner is very accepting while Maggie will have no part of Simon as she thinks her dad will return.  Nina bends over backwards to make living with Simon more than just physical, but Maggie won’t let go of her dad which causes all kinds of issues within the house.  The book starts slowly, but builds to a can’t-put-it-down pace as secrets are revealed and Nina comes to her senses.  As the title suggests, the new husband isn’t all that he appears to be.

This is, of course, the author's prerogative, to use faith as a foundation for true success, so one can hardly complain when he does it; but the astute reader should perhaps check this book out of a library first, and then purchase if he can agree with faith as a feasible starting point for success.Actually, THINK AND GROW RICH, by Napoleon Hill, and a book used as a text in  a decades-ago class in leadership, was a bit more straightforward.",3,0,660,0.212,0

Murder, mayhem, international intrigue, fracking, WMD, and plain old jealousy and greed make it a very hard book to put down.  This is the 6th in the Memory Man series but it can easily be read as a standalone.

This was my first introduction to the Will Robie character, as I missed the beginning of the series and have not gone back to despite my best attempts to do so.  The charm and uniqueness of Decker is largely absent and, although I did find the information about the oil and gas industry on American soil interesting, it was not enough to elevate the book for me.  Perhaps, instead of reading more about Amos Decker's future endeavors, I will just read Memory Man again.  The first book in the series was light years better than Walk the Wire.",3,0,613,0.116,0

So it was with great pleasure that I received the notice that this book was being released.  This final(?) volume in the series continues the adventures of the half vampire Christopher Csejthe as he faces another supernatural catastrophe.  This book continues the snarky humor, and literary and historical references and in jokes of the earlier books.

I appreciate his service (both Military and Congressional), what he stands for and how he stands for it.  With that said, I actually purchased and listened to this book through Audible.com (which is owned by Amazon).  At the time of this writing (April 17), this book has twelve ""1 star"" reviews, NONE of which are from verified purchasers.I enjoy reading and have recommended numerous ""good"" books to friends but this is one of the very few books I would classify as an ""important"" book.  In my daily work, I interact with a lot of young people (18 to mid 20s) and I have personally seen many examples of the types of fragility Representative Crenshaw talks about and through my own life experience over the past 5 decades, I know the importance of ""Fortitude"".  He does an outstanding job describing what Fortitude is, why it is important, and how to develop it.  I have raised my kids to the best of my ability on the principles contained in this book and I will be giving copies of this book to them to keep reinforcing this crucial character trait.To Mr. Crenshaw, thank you for writing this book!",5,0,1218,0.157,1

I do think the book itself, up to the end, was quite enjoyable, chilling, thrilling, and well written.  I was able to easily breeze through it, but after reviewing on the arc site I received I continued to think about the abrupt ending and thought it took at least 1 star or more away.

The Virgin and the Rogue features Charlotte...a young, inexperienced girl engaged to be married to her childhood friend.  Charlotte is quiet, always does what she's told and aims to never cross the line.  Along comes Kingston...her new brother-in-law's stepbrother.  Kingston has been known to be a rake.  He rarely stays in one place for long and has zero qualms about doing what he wants or feels like doing.Until lately.  Kingston decides he wants to try touching base once again with some sense of home and family and comes to visit his stepbrother where he meets Charlotte.  An incident that same night throws the two together and turns both their lives seemingly upside down to the point where neither really knows what they want or expect.  The story is well written, engaging and fun.  I gave it 4 stars only for some of the fantastical basis involving a ""love potion"" that just didn't really feel necessary or realistic.  That being said, it didn't ruin the book for me and Charlotte and Kingston's tale made it hard for me to put the book down. I will definitely be reading more from this author and series.

I have read the previous book which added to my enjoyment of this one but I did feel this is a standalone book.  Julia first marriage was to Kitson, who is the son of a Duke.  Julia and Kitson ran off together to marry so that neither would have to face a forced marriage.  Although they found companionship with each other there was no great passion.  Then Kitson was killed in accident that left Julia a young widower expecting a child. Kitson's father took control of Julia keeping tight hand on her with the threat of taking her son Chatwyn away from her.  Julia goes forward to find her way of excepting him and taking her son.  This leads her to meet Garrett.  Garrett took a path that gentlemen don't do and that is to actually work.  After his father died, he took a ship his father won in a card game and became what he is today owning a successful shipping company.  But once he meets Julia she steels his heart and he goes forward to help her with her mission of freedom.

Every chapter has an interesting story about someone who accomplished or is accomplishing a big dream to give an example for each big question, along with wise quotes that stick with you.  The author has a style of writing that doesn't bore you, and he asks some very good questions about making your dreams come to life, like the cost question (are you willing to pay the price for your dream?) and the people question (do you have the right help for your dream?).  Althought most of this may seem like plain old common sense, Maxwell goes deeper into each question and expounds on them with things you may not have considered.  He challenges, inspires, and motivates you to do your best so you can live life the way you were made to and make an impact.Dreaming is easy.  Making it happen is another story entirely.  But it's worth the effort and more rewarding than anything else.  I give this 4 stars instead of 5 because I feel he could have added more to it (don't ask me what, I'm new at making reviews!) but for me I thought it was fine the way it is.

Leo is the super quiet Amish guy who hardly ever says a word to her, which she takes as rejection rather than his extreme shyness and guilt that he clings to.

Earning a decent living to take care of her children is uppermost in Jennie’s mind.  There is a fire that threatens the livelihood of the community, and lives are at stake.  Can Jennie Learn to trust and love again?  Will Leo’s shyness and load of guilt keep him from love and commitment?I enjoyed Kelly Irvin’s story, as her work flows very well on the page.

Last but not least, he knew the value of treating the artists as real people who had great talent but not always great confidence.While I know the Van Halen catalog well, it was fun to stream the songs mentioned in the book on Amazon Music when I was reading.  I definitely became a bigger fan of the Doobie Brothers and Van Morrison.I really appreciate Ted for his role in making some of my favorite music.  I also appreciate Greg for telling these amazing untold stories of the music I love.Cheers,Mark A. White (using my lovely bride, Jen’s Amazon ID)",5,0,1261,0.372,0
1942,"within the first twenty pages is a graphic description of a father beating his disabled daughter, so I guess that really sets the tone for how terrible this book is.because it is absolutely terrible.the characters are cliche, the writing uninspired, and everything is just so unlikable and predictable. I would give the author some slack considering it's a debut novel and debuts are very rarely perfect, but when you hit every stereotype and lack the prose to compensate, it's hard to find anything to compliment. there's little in way of the plot that's salvageable; at every turn, both the protagonist and the killer he's chasing have to remind you how much modern/""PC"" culture sucks in the most boomer fashion possible; every woman is valued only by how sexually attractive the protagonist finds her (shoved into the only two categories to ever exist: ""hot"", or ""fat and evil""); and the antagonist is made evil by his terminal illness, which isn't really too bad of a thing, I guess, it's just frustrating to me personally. the whole relationship between the protagonist's and the killer wife is really uncomfortable. there is really nothing good about this experience aside from the fact that it was short and I was able to finish it quickly.",1,0,1247,0.069,1
1943,"This was a beautiful story but I did not like all the jumping around from present to past.  I did not find it to be well woven, but rather a bit disjointed.Still, the characters are all well delineated, and most of them are charming.  I found I did not like knowing so little about Boop's married life.  I wasn't satisfied with the details of the marriage or the relationship with her husband.I am of an age that is not the same , but similar to Boop's age, and understand the often insurmountable difficulties unplanned pregnancies caused in that day, which thankfully are less often encountered today.",4,0,603,0.143,0
1944,"This novel isn't a literary great, but it presents an excellent look into both adoption and divorce.  It would be a wonderful book for a 9-18 year old that was adopted and has only now been told.  It also would be helpful for a child whose parent's are divorcing.  I enjoyed the story itself and the friendships that developed.  I also like the way these two life events were dealt with.  Both were presented in a very positive light.  It's always better to look for the positive in difficult situations and the author did a nice job.  It was a relaxing bedtime book for me.",4,0,574,0.36,0
1945,"Written with the skill of a historian, the heart of a baseball fan, and the soul of a Wisconsinite, Home of the Braves chronicles the saga of the Milwaukee Braves.  Covering their move from Boston and their eventual move to Atlanta, the book is the story of a city and team falling in love with each other... and the subsequent heartbreak of a romance gone wrong.It's important to know what you're getting with this book.  It is not, primarily, a story of the team's on-the-field exploits.  The Braves' pennant runs and World Series championship – and later lean years – are covered to the extent that they contextualize the evolution of the relationship between the town and the city.  The book is, rather, principally a history of the politics, economics, and relationships that determined the arc of the Braves in Milwaukee.Professor Steele's exhaustive research is evident in the richly sourced narrative. The chain of events of the Braves' move from Boston, their gradually souring relationship with their new hometown, and their eventual move to Atlanta are presented in such a way that invites readers to make their own conclusion as to who was the most to blame.For me, it was a genuinely thought-provoking work not just because I spent my undergraduate years in Milwaukee and still have relatives in Wisconson, but because the same fate nearly befell two of my own favorite teams.  In the mid-1990s, word was the Seattle Mariners may move to Florida and the Seattle Seahawks were owned by a businessman who couldn't move them to Los Angeles fast enough (and in 2008, Seattle would lose its professional basketball franchise).  Following the story of Milwaukee and its Braves invited me to make my own comparisons and contrasts. How professional football and baseball were saved in Seattle would probably make for fascinating books as well, assuming they had an author as gifted as Professor Steele.I thoroughly enjoyed the book (and while I have the good fortune to know the author, I bought my own copy – and would happily do so again). I think knowing what you're getting into when you start reading it is critical: a reader who is looking for a vibrant recreation of the exploits between the foul lines and in the dugout may well be frustrated (even though the forward is pretty clear about what the book is and what it isn't).  On the other hand, readers curious about the events and decisions that determined the franchise's fate in Wisconsin will be richly rewarded.",5,0,2481,0.183,1
1946,"An excellent compilation of the history of schizophrenia, the advances, setbacks, present day research and philosophies, and most importantly, the dynamics surrounding a family so impacted by mental illness.

1947,"I admire this book.  I teach college physics and this clearly explained story both in history and in science was a page turner of the first rank.  Being interested in the Civil War and knowing a little of the story of the submarine that sank a Union ship in Chalestown harbor, I was drawn to this title at once.  It  was gripping to read and is fully understandable to all.  Indeed, the experimental details of how the testing of the hypothesis of what caused the submarine to be lost  was done superbly.  By the end I was convinced that Rachel Lance's explanation is fully plausable.",5,0,584,0.106,0
1948,"This is the third book in this series.  I liked the positive reviews on this best selling author, so I ordered and received Kindle versions of the first two, The Terminal List and True believer.  I read and reviewed them and came back to read one when I finish them.Folks, if you like a well-written action-packed thriller, this is it. Jack Carr is a skilled story teller and an expert in his knowledge of Navy Seal snipers because he was one in middle eastern combat zones.SPOILER ALERT FOR THE FIRST TWO BOOKS.  Nearly everyone James Reece loved was killed as a result of high level politicians and high ranking criminals in the  military or associates from greedy lobbyists.  His entire unit was infected with a substance causing brain tumors and the crooked people behind it used their powers to kill the members that were exposed.  James was framed and his loved ones were murdered in a plot to kill him. Clearly they underestimated the resolve of former frogman sniper, James Reece and one by one he hunted the killers and  made them pay for the murder of his friends and family as well as the tumor growing in his brain.After saving the life of the President of the United States on foreign soil and the murder of Reece's best friend, Reece and those who helped him escape from those in the American government who hunted him would be granted pardons if Reece would agree to contract with the CIA for dangerous missions.The protagonist agrees, he completes the assigned mission and has his brain operation.  While recovering, he plans revenge on the Russian sniper who killed his friend and those responsible for planning and executing his father, former Navy Seal, Thomas Reece.  While recovering in a remote spot in Montana. One of those targets, former CIA agent Oliver Gray turned trader, now working for the Russian mob used those assets to hunt down Reece and put him in the ground along with his friend, and former seal, Raife Hastings.The action accelerates and tables turn as Reece, Raife Hastings, Raife's family and CIA and seal friends prepare for battle on a Russian Island and beyond.I recommend reading the first two books in this series to enhance the character development and storyline.This is an enthralling, action-packed thriller that I really had trouble putting down.  I hope the author continues writing episodes to expand this series.I recommend this tale to family, friends, others who love this genre type.  It was a thoroughly entertaining read!Enjoy!",5,0,2486,0.19,1

I don't know about Heckenlively, but Milkovitz is certainly best known now for the awful ""Plandemic"" video, which was pulled from social media platforms for its egregious errors and fabrications- an appropriate summary of her career.  The very concept of these authors restoring faith in the promise of science would be laughable if it weren't for the fact that their statements are in fact doing considerable harm to that very thing.

You can totally understand why Piper fell for Harley, a man who loves unconditionally and takes care of his family with such love and devotion.

She works from her home office with her two adorable cats as her assistants.Alice attended a seminar for a new computer program for her clients to purchase and she will use when she is doing their books.She was finding small amount money missing usually less than $10.00.  Most of her clients told her to forget about the small amount of money missing from their accounts.But Alice being a bookkeeper couldn’t let it go. Alice found a large consulting company online with the tag “Are you a small business owner with a problem?” We will help you for free.Alice contacted them  and one of the owners-Derek decided to come to her house and help the small business owner.  Derek thought this would be a quick fix.  But after a few hours and getting his tech guy involved and they couldn’t find the problem.Derek liked Alice and liked him.  This friendship developed and so did the mystery of the missing money.Alice has a good friend who teaches self-defense and a friend who owns a beauty salon.There will be three books in this series and I am looking forward to reading the book about Alice’s friends and more about Derek.,5,0,1292,0.186,0
1957,"I just received this book and already love the way that it’s organized.  The recipes seem interesting and I like the anecdotal stories.One thing I did notice is that the recipe for Raspberry Cream Puff cake uses profiteroles.  However, based on the photo on page 160, it looks like Chef Ansel also applied a craquelin topping to the profiterole.  I don’t see how that kind of crust can be achieved otherwise & there is no mention of it in the recipe.  The profiterole recipe provided would have a smoother crust.  If Chef Ansel can clarify this and or provide his technique to get that crackly crust, It would be very much appreciated.  Thank you!",4,0,647,0.187,1

The revenge and vengeance themes are off the charts... you can feel it.  I also love supporting an American hero turned author.

1960,"Do you enjoy women's fiction?  Are you ready to be immersed in a long (464 page) book?  If you  might answer yes to these questions, this title could provide you with an escapist read.The setting is Lake Tahoe, a beautiful and peaceful place with lots of water, places to walk and sports to enjoy.  There are three protagonists; Serenity, Reagan and Lorelei.Serenity writes books about true crimes.  There is a true crime in her personal life that has changed everything for her.  Next is Reagan; she is an ambitious, successful advertising executive until one decision and one moment changes everything. She will be faced with some big decisions. Then there are Lorelei and her four year old daughter Lucy.  Lorelei grew up in foster care and knows nothing about her family.  She was happy in her marriage until...What do these women have in common?  No spoiler as this comes out early in the novel; the three share a blood relationship discovered after they did testing with a DNA site.  How are they connected?  Who is their common biological relative?  Why has no-one ever discussed any of this with any of them>  You will need to get very close to the end of the book to find the answer.Around this central plot there are many others involving the sisters' families, their evolving relationship and their next door neighbors, all of whom have their own stories.  The strands intertwine and four narrators voice the story; these are the three sisters and Finn, one of the neighbors.Overall, this was a book where the pages turned.  The characters are well established and each is very much their own person.  That said, I think that the novel might have been (even) better had it been shorter.  Sometimes sections replayed things that were already known to the reader.This was the first novel that I have read by this author.

However, the other characters and the storylines involving them were so emeshed in historic events and details that I found boring.  I like hard science fiction when it is new material to me.  Rehashing past events of the last century and rewriting the details of each event was a complicated method to explore the theoretical effect of time travel.

The whole ""Southern Belle"", passive-aggressive, status seekers and status defiant, Southerners thing, and the rampant hypocrisy of the culture (so-called) is very much like my personal experiences in North Carolina and Alabama, and it brought back distasteful memories.Good writing, just not for me.E.M.

1967,"Even though Trevor Noah grew up relatively poor in South Africa, it seems that the story of his youth isn’t much different from growing up relatively poor in parts of the United States.  What makes his youth so decisively different is that he had the strength to go on when it would have been much easier to surrender to his fate than find a better life. I mean can you imagine that when he was born, it was a crime for his black mother to marry his white father?  Just his existence was cause for his mother to be unable to walk with him down the street.  He didn’t fit in with the whites, the blacks or even really the colored people since he was brought up to question authority.Noah talks about his special treatment because of his white father but more importantly, how his mother fought to make him better.  A lot of the stories that he tells make you reflect on how being poor and without education can doom a life.  All of the stories are told with humor and a part of “how did I survive” type awe.  I really enjoyed this and had no idea that his life was so full of horror since what he presents on television is completely different from his background.  This is definitely a feel-good book.",5,0,1201,0.131,1

1969,"I'll admit that this one sat on my TBR pile for a while- don't let it sit on yours.  This is the story of Ana, a strong intelligent woman who defies her family to marry, of all people, Jesus.  It's her story more than his.  I found myself swept into a world where women were not allowed to read and write (although Ana did so), where teens were married to old men so that their parents could consolidate land or power, where teens whose betrothed died were still considered unclean widows, where living meant grinding wheat and milking goats, and so much more.  In this imagined history, Judas is Ana's adopted brother.  If you, like me, are not intimately familiar with the story of Jesus, John the Baptist, Judas, and the politics of the period, this might send you to google occasionally.  Ana is a wonderful character but so are others such as Tabitha, whose story will stick with me.  I loved what Ana inscribed on her bowl- that she had a voice. I loved when she let the lambs loose.  This is not a religious book and Jesus is presented as a very real man who works to support his family and who does both small and large acts of kindness.  It's beautifully and thoughtfully written.

If you’re not a bird-lover, it’s likely that you will find yourself appreciating birds a lot more after reading this book.  But, more importantly, you’ll end up with a greater sense of wonderment about life itself--biology, history, spirituality.  Somehow, Crazy For Birds packs all of that into its beautifully, imaginatively illustrated pages.  Along with the images (that seem to be half doodle, half masterpiece), there is a lot of amazing and funny information about birds, and the information about birds is tied into crazy information about many other things. (My favorite pages are about ostrich eggs, which apparently have been used as religious symbols for hundreds of years (at least) in mosques, churches, and synagogues all over Africa, Europe, and the Middle East.)  Unless you’re an ornithologist, you will gain a ton of amazing bird-knowledge from this book, while laughing at all the little jokes, and admiring all the beautiful illustrations.

1978,"Every person who has the primary responsibility of managing their family diet and food budget knows that the two do not necessarily work toward the same goal.  So we look for recipes that will fit into our time, tastes and wallet.  Pamela Salzman obviously had the same problems I do when trying to bump up our diet.  Her recipes are not just quick, they are tasty and use standard pantry ingredients.  You do not have to add another shelf in your cabinet for new items.  We have tried at least half of these recipes so far and will keep trying the rest.  So far, none of them have received a thumbs down!!!",5,0,607,0.022,1
1979,"Ameilia Grey is a new to me author and this is the second in this ""First Comes Love"" series that I was glad to get a copy to read and review as I very much enjoyed the first book.Ms. Julia Fairbright has been in the state of a widow for about 4 years and is somewhat at the mercy of her father-in-law who has his own notions of what a prim and proper widow she should be.  Essentially she is a prisoner to the man and it doesn't help that he is a Duke.  In any case she has to walk on eggshells around his staff in order for them not to report her comings and goings.  When she finds out some damaging information that could help her come from under his foot, she enlists a best friend and unintentionally drags Garrett Stockton in to the picture.Mr. Garrett Stockton is a wealthy owner of several shipping companies and has returned to England to attend a wedding.  He unfortunately stumbles across Julia stuck in a tree and their the attraction ignites for him.  As Garrett can't forget Julie, the daily meetings turns their desire into a romantic relationship.  Although the title sounds delicious, the book fail a bit short for me and was very fuzzy in places.  I thought the relationship moved a bit too fast as they only knew each other for about a week.  I'll admit that I like the sexual attraction and intimacy in the stories I read, but 4 or more in a week is a bit much.  It was not clear why her father-in-law had such a hold on her and her son. Didn't think she owed him anything.  I think that could have been expounded on a bit more instead of showing him as a villain early on the story.At times, there was a bit of disconnect between Julie and Garrett but in other places it was oh so lovely.  It could have been chalked up to their character portrayal...could have been more depth to them to make them a bit more interesting.  The characters kind of fell a bit flat and there was alot of potential and development that could have been done to Garrett's character.  Although the story kept up the repetitiveness of Julia's constant speaking of the Duke control over her and her circumstances, at some point early on in the story she should have developed a backbone to break free.In summary, was I blown over by this story...not so much as the first but it was an enjoyable enough read.  I did like the slight build on Brina's character and am hoping the next would be about her story.",3,0,2402,0.114,0

Breakfast options include Zucchini Bread Baked Oatmeal, Oat Flour Blueberry Pancakes, Smoked Salmon Scramble, Mexican-Style Shakshuka, Smoked Trout Breakfast Salad, etc.  The Shredded Brussel Sprouts and Apple Slaw with Cider-Mustard Dressing was a hit at our home along with the Cauliflower Clam Chowder and The Easy Israeli Shrimp Salad.

The school bullying incidents revealed so much about Aurora’s and Sunny’s history as well as their personalities that it was a powerful component of the book.  And while I can guess what Sunny can’t recall about her history with Levi, I look forward to the story to see if I am correct.  The stories within a story in this novel has left so many questions and so much material for future installments it’s ridiculous.  Amazingly so.",5,0,545,0.149,0
1982,What I didn't like about the book is the author never fully explained why Decker's ability to see different colors around the dead was changing.  The rarely mentioned any other issues he was having with his almost supernatural powers was starting to fluctuate.  The story line itself was good but the use of Kelly was somewhat limited to the story line.  did like the issues of government and military interactions because I served in a similar capacity as a active duty scientist and then as a civilian research scientist for a total of 36 years.,4,0,547,0.073,0

Imagine my surprise when I opened the table of contents and found them to be identical to the ""Challenging Common Core Math"" series books, which have a copyright of 2016 (except they removed references to ""Common Core"" within the lessons and just had the correlation at the end).

The true gift of this book is that it meets the reader where they are on their own spiritual journey.

While there are many facilities that take care of their clients it is also true that some are in it just for the money.  The recent focus on Covid-19, infection control, and, the high number of deaths among patients has brought additional attention to the sector.  This is a a worthwhile book to read while socially distancing.  This is a sequel but it is not necessary to have read the first work, but it was pretty good, too.",5,0,591,0.214,1

Kat and Jas are a perfectly matched pair matched who have harbored secret feelings for each other for years but because of their personal issues (her panic attacks and agoraphobia, his stoicism and ptsd) and professional issues (he's her longtime head of security) they've never acted on them.  We first meet Kat following a therapy session where her therapist suggests she try to be open to dating.  Unfortunately her chance meeting in a cafe threatens her closely guarded privacy when she becomes the viral subject of romantic speculation with a stranger.  The viral #cafebae storyline was so frustrating and I definitely sympathized with Kat.Kat retreats to Jas' childhood home.  I really liked the glimpse into Jas' family life and how well Kat fits in, she's a calming and understanding addition.

These two questions are answered in John C Maxwell's newest book ""Put Your Dream to the Test: 10 Questions to Help You See it and Seize it"".  This is a very well written book that helps you remember that dream that you have always had and how to ""put it to the test"" and get it accomplished.  By asking yourself the 10 questions, you are able to clarify your dream and start on the path to fulfilling that dream.I really believe that the first question is the most important.  (The Ownership Question: Is My Dream Really My Dream?)  Is your dream really yours?  Many times we are living out someone else's dream for our life.  If you answer that question in the affirmative, then you begin going through the rest of the questions and ""testing"" your dream.  Each chapter covers one question and it also includes a real-life story that is relevant that that section.  Also, at the end of each chapter that are questions you can ask yourself to see if you are on track.Overall, this will be one of my favorite books to read again and again.  John C.

Then there are the horses built into this drama like the unbreakable backbone of an indestructible creature.

He tosses in a good amount of humor, so you're not bogged down in all the serious subjects.  Admittedly, I started my adventure with Dave Rubin through his podcasts.

2009,"I quit reading Stuart Woods after about the 20th Stone Barrington novel (not sure why it took me so long).  Grisham, once one of my favorites, is sneaking down that path with this latest novel that follows the exploits of a character from his previous novel.  The character is rich, has a beautiful wife, and is the ring-leader of a group of writers.  The plot is thinly stretched to include a hurricane, a contract murder, and nursing home abuse.  This was by far my least favorite Grisham novel, but I’ll give him another chance, as long as he comes up with something new and not a rehash of a previous work.",3,0,610,0.15,0

This is an ongoing adventure, starting with Mark of Fire. I highly recommend starting at the beginning and reading each story in order.

If you read those books, you will come to realize that something like ISIS is not even close to the biggest outside danger that the US faces.  This book, Broken, is filled with 6 different stories.  It will take you about an hour to read each one, each one engrossing into itself.  You can read one story a night and be very satisfied.

But it was too gruesome for me, and not enough fun.  It felt like it tried to include all the tropes.  But most troubling to me was in this supposedly light and fun book, a black man was buried alive, and there was animal cruelty.  Neither added to the story.

Join Sophie and her furry crew as she takes on a new adventure that leads to quite a busy time just trying to fit all the questions and clues together.  You’ll get some good tips from Sophie and Natasha and you’ll find some yummy recipes included.  I think I would like a copy of Tilly’s book.

2033,"I bought this book to help me find my blue flame (duh), but I've found so many awesome little tidbits that will change the way I operate, blue flame or not.  For example, Fulwiler's thoughts on owning your tempo and knowing what kind of sleeper you are are so intuitive but also things I had never thought about.  Especially during this time when our schedules are disrupted and we have an opportunity to rethink things like our focus, tempo, and sleep, these little additions are huge.  I've been excited for this book since pre-ordering in October, and it did not disappoint.  I've already ordered a copy for my sister too :-)",5,0,628,0.21,1
2034,"Epic Psychological Thriller!When you go through a tragedy, it makes you vulnerable.  That vulnerability is the perfect time for a predator to attack.  As parents, we always worry so much about how our children are handling traumatic situations, but more often than not, it is our children that are able to handle those situations best.  In this story, Nina's daughter is able to see right through the predators games.Nina is weak, and finds love after her husband goes missing.  Is he alive? Did he abandon his children? Is he having an affair?In comes Simon, just at the right time, and seems to be the perfects solution to Nina's stressful situation.  She can now afford to stay in the town where her children have grown up.  She is able to go out and get a job.  But what will this all cost her?Nina's daughter Maggie isn't fooled.  She sees all the red flags.  Now how will she convince her mother that she is just trying to be a petulant child.  She really things they are in danger.This story takes a pretty dark turn and at first it feels like maybe the author has taken this a bit overboard.  But you soon realize Simon's patterns are in fact patterns of men that are controlling and calculating.It was very interesting to read this from both Nina's perspective and the daughters perspective.  It makes you understand how some women are blind to the manipulation.The last 80 pages of this book had me reading through squinted eyes because I just couldn't believe what was happening.I read some of this via audiobook because I could NOT put it down.  I struggle with audiobooks generally but this was one that was very easy to focus on and pay attention to.  The book was narrated by Rebecca Soler and January Lavoy.  The both did an amazing job.If you are looking for a psychological thriller that will get your blood pumping, be sure to pick this one up.",5,0,1863,0.147,0

2039,"""I began to explore the uncharted territory of my mind and heart.  Before long, this search became my greatest passion.""  ""Perhaps...I am no different than these German soldiers.  Perhaps, we are all the same.""  Mendek Rubin.  The beauty and great importance of this book cannot be overstated. I expected another Holocaust survivor story--a grim tale of the basic human desire to live.  This is not the case here. What makes ""Quest For Eternal Sunshine"" universally relevant is not Mendek's survival of Hitlers' death camps, but his escape from the inner, invisible hell of the mind.  And this is, from my perspective and experience, by far the greatest possible accomplishment we human beings can make.  Mendek Rubin was deeply fortunate to have found the heaven within--through intense perseverance and intelligence.  This story so inspires me--because now I am confident that I, too, can rise above my clouded mind and reach the eternal sunshine, that most call ""enlightenment.""  Mendek reveals how he achieved his life's true purpose--thus leaving us with a treasure-trove of practical wisdom that anyone can utilize, at any time.  It is never too late to find this eternal  sunshine---as Tolstoy so brilliantly conveys in his famous novella, ""The Death of Ivan Ilyich.""  ""...death, where is it?""  He sought his former accustomed fear of death and did not find it.  ""Where is it?  What death?""  There was no fear because there was no death.  In place of death there was light.  ""So that's what it is!"" he suddenly exclaimed aloud.  ""What joy!""  Thus did Ivan Ilyich, driven by intense suffering and fear, find enlightenment--and died a few hours later.""Quest for Eternal Sunshine"" is destined to be a classic.  It may take years, or decades, for this book to become widely read, but, as I believe Mendek himself would say--""what's the hurry?  let's enjoy today!""",5,0,1866,0.198,1
2040,"What a great addition to my herb library! I began studying herbal medicine over 20 years ago and think this book has much to offer to the whole spectrum of herb lovers and is super accessible for beginners.  Lots of beautiful pictures, excellent ID tips (along with plant look-alikes), how to grow and harvest, along with really good, concise information about medicinal uses and wonderful recipes.  It's broken down by seasons and has lots of journal exercises and ideas to keep you really engaged.  One of the things I love most about it that sets it apart from many other herb books is that it's not a book to read and set aside; it has you actively engaged from the beginning without being overwhelmed.  You can read the early chapters of the book and jump right to the current season and go right out and start getting to know your local wild medicine and make medicine right off the bat.  Actually you could open the book to the chapter on dandelions, read about them and head out to gather dandelion flowers, make the delicious dandelion maple syrup cake and then go back to the beginning of the book to really start taking in the information.  Rosalee and Emily are brilliant at making the world of wild medicine come alive.",5,0,1232,0.194,0

Through Your Story Matters, I realized that I've simply been looking in the wrong places, following instructions for a different kind of writing.  She takes her readers chapter by chapter, on a journey.  She slows it down, removes the urgency and insistence, and gives us permission to wander and explore, to delve deeply or not so deeply, depending on our level of comfort.

It is nothing like The Hating Game--the writing can be funny at times (the writer has potential), but the characters are absolutely terrible.  The two main characters are unlikeable and immature.  There is zero chemistry between the two of them.  I wasn't rooting for either one of them.  Please save your $12.

2049,"I really found the murder mystery investigation part of this plot staged over the span of decades compelling. It was my first time reading anything by the author and I was impressed by the intricacy of the plot, with three different time periods and three sets of investigators, suspects and victims all playing into each other over fifty plus years.  I would definitely read books by this author again.  Local funding issues that threatened the local police department's continued existence also raised the level of tension in a very realistic fashion.Just a few issues kept this from rating five stars in my view.  First, I was baffled from the beginning about the author's time table. Most of the story takes place in ""present day.""  To me that means in the most recent one to two years (i.e. 2018 or 2019).  Yet Russ, the police chief hero, is in his mid-fifties in present day and was only twenty  during the summer 1972 part of the story (approximately forty-six or forty-seven years earlier).  This does not compute and I thought either author or editor should have caught the discrepancy.  I read an advance copy, so maybe the published addition will correct this.Second, it was somewhat confusing shooting back and forth between investigations of nameless victims in 1952, 1972 and present day, especially when the investigators overlapped.  Eventually, once more was learned about each victim, it was easier to keep the cases straight.And finally, though the murder mystery is resolved, the book definitely ends on a tense cliffhanger involving several of the secondary characters and in a depressing manner for the hero.  I was disappointed with the outcome for Russ and Clare, but especially Russ.Thanks to publishers Minotaur and Macmillan for providing an advance copy of the book;  this is my voluntary and honest review.",4,0,1836,0.067,0

2051,"A terrific complex read that ranges over three time periods and don't worry if you haven't read the previous books- this will be fine as a standalone.  Three times young women have been found dressed in party clothes, barefoot, and in the middle of a road.  Russ Van Alstyne, who was newly back from Vietnam, was actually a suspect in 1972 because he found the body.  Now he's chief of Police in Millers Falls and there's another.  Clare, his wife, is a priest and she's struggling a bit with being a new mother and with her sobriety but she's always up to help Russ.  There's a second thread involving Hadly, an MFPD officer, and Kevin, who left the MFPD for Syracuse.  AND there's the issue of whether the department is dissolved and policing passed over to the State.  All in all, while the plot zips quickly, it's the characters who really pull you in. The tension ramps up slowly but well and you will be surprised, as I was, at the answer to the cold cases.  This ends, no spoilers, with several big cliff hangers of the oh no variety and it's all the better for keeping those questions in your head.  Thanks to the publisher for the ARC.

To do this you must build your strength of will-- … and use that to bring your essence, your energy, and your spirit to bear on the battle.

2057,"The Socialite is the first book I have read by J’nell Ciesielski.  I can honestly say I like her style.  The romance between Kat and Barrett was believable, and I enjoyed their chemistry.  The progression of their relationship seemed as if it could have been based on a true story instead of purely fiction.  At times it was hard seeing the Natzi’s point of view, and imagining how many of the officers had mistresses.  Emma being one of those was an interesting point of view, and I’m sure her experience was much more glamorous than most. I enjoyed Kat’s perspective from being taken care of her whole life, to seeing that there was a lot worse suffering going on compared to rationing her lipstick.  Getting to know Barrett broke down several of her misconceptions while opening her eyes to new possibilities.  I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys Historical Romance.

2058,"I couldn't wait; I pre-ordered from the publisher.Forty years ago, Mt. St. Helen's blew its top.  It'd had been grumpy for several months, and a whole lot of scientists were just waiting.  Chief among these were those biologists whose concerns were with what happens when something wipes the slate more or less clean and the land must rebuild itself.  Eric Wagner's book, After the Blast, is fascinating report of how those scientists -- now two generations of them -- went about teasing out the story.After the Blast is a series of vignettes.  Key field researchers are profiled; ne had a sense of who these men and women are.  The particular puzzles they're out to untangle are presented; the science is complex, but Dr. Wagner is a talented story teller, and he has the scientific background as well, to explain things in such a way that one does not lose the thread of the story in a heap of jargon and technique.Along the way, the reader gets a strong insight into what happens around the science.  This is not a small enterprise:  People have to get around, often into places where access is nigh unto impossible, and helicopters are not cheap rentals.  Much of the time, it's not one scientist, but a team -- a senior researcher, colleagues and graduate students, undergraduates and even a few local people who just get caught up in the whole business.  The tale of administration, amounting (it is suggested...) to internecene warfare is also part of the story.  Lots of stakeholders makes for no small amount of tsuris, agida and it's an important part of the story.Things get done, and the entire science changes.  This is partly normal development, but some of the change in ecology as a special biological discipline is seen arising in the course of four decades of careful examination and thinking about what was going on.  At the end of the book, what has been learned at Mt. St. Helen's is being applied and expanded around other active volcanos, for example.I always enjoy reading Eric Wagner's tales.  He is literate in every sense of the word.  He writes extraordinarily well, and manages to teach me new things in a painless way.  This is a rare gift, clearly.

The book does not disappoint in this respect.  The basic format of the book is to present a socialist argument, and then present counterarguments based in history and facts. My problem with the Kindle version is one of presentation.  All of the socialist arguments are presented as graphics rather than text and when read both through my Kindle paperwhite and on my computer Kindle App THE GRAPHICS DO NOT SCALE AUTOMATICALLY.  They are TINY and almost impossible to read without a magnifying glass.  While I can make them readable by selecting them individually, this interrupts the flow of the reading, and, on the paperwhite at least, often invokes unwanted highlight, dictionary, etc, controls with my fumble fingers.

2069,"Author Paulette Jiles has taken a character from a previous book (NEWS OF THE WORLD) and given him his own story.  This is a tale that occurs just prior to his appearance in the last book.  This book is aptly named just for him, SIMON THE FIDDLER, although his adventures draw in a cast of memorable characters that remain with readers long after they move out of Simon’s life. I admit to wondering if any of these characters might elicit books from Jiles down the line;  honestly maybe I was wishing they would.  Simon is exceptionally talented at playing fiddle and less able at avoiding conscription in the waning days of the Civil War.  Somehow his musical skills always pull him out of scrapes and calm his temper.  Jiles’ writing skills are, as ever, truly amazing.  Texas is as alternatingly bleak and colorful as ever.  Her worlds demand attention and I could stay there long after her books end.  This book, the same as the preceding one, is a marvel.  This can easily be read as a stand alone but why would you stop at one?  They are so very good.  I received my copy from the publisher through edelweiss.",5,0,1115,0.119,0

2071,"Reading Brad’s book “Humankind”, amd really enjoying it.  He shares the personal story of the kindness shown to him and his wife as his wife battled serious health issues.  It’s a great look at how sometimes even the smallest and simplest acts of kindness can make a remarkable difference in someone’s day, week, year or life.  One little act can set in place a chain reaction, like a secret Santa society, that literally changes the world.

On one hand, I was fascinated by Olsson’s evocation of the setting; Sydney in the mid-60’s was a culture deeply divided between its past and its future.  On the brink of the Vietnam war draft, with the iconic Opera House in mid-construction, Australia was a country of immigrants unsure how to deal with its diversity.Ultimately, though, the plot moved too languidly to keep me fully engaged.

2088,"Your Story Matters is luminous inspiration and a practical guide rolled into one wonderful book for aspiring  writers.  Leslie Leyland Fields is an enthusiastic and talented teacher, walking the reader through ""why"" it's important to write your story as well as ""how"" to do it.  The ""why's"" are freeing; to tell the truth, to heal, to share wisdom, to help others, to pass down your story to future generations, to point to how God intersects with our lives.  Leslie makes the case that that every story matters simply because we all matter to God.  The ""how's"" are immensely helpful, from mining your memories, mapping, word-seeking, setting a scene, structuring the inner story and the outer story and editing. It is a bright shining light to remember your ""why"" and a useful guide filled with tools to turn to again and again.  Reading Your Story Matters renewed my desire to write more of my own story as well as read all the books Leslie has written, being such a gifted writer herself.  It's an opportunity to learn from a master teacher.  I highly recommend this book for anyone aspiring to weave words together beautifully to tell their own unique story.",5,0,1162,0.272,0

Serefin is caught up in something he has no control over and struggles to keep his throne and his sanity.  Nadya makes impossible choices and discovers shocking truths.  And Malachiasz - what can I say?  He's broken, dangerous, cunning, tortured, and by far my favorite character.  His relationship with Nadya is complicated beyond explanation - love/hate on steroids.  Character development is magnificent - at times I wanted to throttle each of them.Pacing is a bit slower in this book, and occasionally the dialogue was disjointed and confusing, almost as if some lines were missing - possibly a whole scene.  But this was an ARC, so that occasionally happens.Ruthless Gods is a heavy, chaotic, and long read, but something dark fantasy fans will devour.

2091,"The book ""Natural: How faith in nature's goodness leads to harmful fads, unjust laws and flawed science"" is well intended but misguided.I was expecting to love Alan Levpnovitz's book.  My family and I have noticed a trend for years with various natural products, services and things being touted over their manufactured counterparts.  This book attempts to look at natural trends versus objective, or scientific trends.  This author states that the move to nature and natural products is a religious type of movement.  While I felt this book was well intended, I did  not understand the overall thesis of the book.  How is a turn to nature religious in any way?  There are not enough examples or evidence to support this in Levinovitz's work.  The scientific and objective evidence for vaccinations, gender issues and medicine  are well thought out but the spiritual side does not seem balanced.This is more of a philosophical work on how nature trends are obscuring scientific facts.  It is written in a textbook type format, without much of a personal touch or interpretation of events. I did not like the writing style, it was not personal at all and seemed condescending at times. The author is very convinced of his evidence and writing ability and seems haughty.  I was expecting when I got this book more of a discussion on popular natural trends and how they are debunked by science.  Instead, I got a book that philosophizes what nature really is and what it cannot be without enough scientific examples to suit the author's purpose.

Noah's mother died when he was a young but him being the oldest of his siblings had him promising her that he would take care of them.  So Noah has been doing just that...working hard and taking care of his siblings.  Never resting or stopping even after they find that they are part of a wealthy family and have money now.  Andie has always been a friend and somewhat of a adopted sibling with the Sinclair siblings.  But with Noah she has always had a crush on him.  When she is tasked with forcing Noah to relax with he is 'kidnapped' by his siblings, it just shows her how much she still feels for him.  For Noah he starts to see Andie as more than a little sister or family friend....but he can't seem to let go of his promise to his mother enough to let go.

2100,"I love Regency and Victorian novels written in modern times as well as novels original to the 19th century (Jane Auste, Elizabeth Gaskell, etc.).  I adore Georgette Heyer.  I'm always looking for a new author to enjoy.  I don't expect everyone to write like Austen or Heyer but I do have more expectations than this book fulfilled.  This book could have been so much better with some revision.  I couldn't understand why the Prince Regent awarded such a high title to a soldier who rescued a godson he clearly did not care about or with whom he had a close relationship.  We never understand why Diana the heroine or her brother are the godchildren of the prince or why this earldom and property are sitting around falling to pieces.  I also did not have enough information to understand why Evan would so quickly trust Marcus as a friend.  He even had Marcus looking over is finances at one point.  There needs to be a better explanation beyond their bonding over shared military backgrounds.  These issues bothered me throughout the book.  Why??  I was also bothered by a bunch of minor historical inaccuracies.  For example, referring to Marcus Haverly as Mr. Haverly.  He is the second son of duke and would have been Lord Marcus Haverly.  The author makes repeated references to him being ""only"" the second son of the duke.  The second son of a duke would have been quite an exalted personage in the Regency world.  The author also makes use of quite a bit of language (expressions and particular words) that just do not fit the time period.  Georgette Heyer purchased letters and written information so she could have her characters speak in a way that evokes the time period and was accurate.  I'm sure the language of her own era influenced her wording but she tried very hard to evoke the period and I believe she succeeded.  I think it would do this author good to read Heyer and Austen. She could also check out well-respected authors writing the Sharpe and Patrick O'Brian series (same time period although very male-focused stories).  I think this author has potential  to improve and I am intrigued to learn more about Marcus. She did a great job of setting up her next book.

Italian Green Bean and Toasted Quinoa Salad is out of this world, as is Macadamia and Sesame Crusted Tuna.Many of the recipes rely on frozen vegetables, which is okay is that's what you have, but I substitute fresh vegetables when I can.  Still, when a recipe such as Creamy Corn and Chive Farro calls for frozen corn, I use it without hesitation.  I love that the recipes call for a wide range of ingredients -- vegetables, grains, meats, spices -- indicating that the author has an expanded palate.  Because of this, you have a better chance of finding individual recipes that appeal to your personal taste.  (I hate when a cookbook author's quirks surface with too many similar ingredients and flavors.)The author's favorite cooking appliance is the Instant Pot, but when she calls for one in certain recipes, she provides alternatives to it.  She also assumes that you own a food processor or the alternative, a blender.  Without these appliances, you can still make a solid portion of the recipes, but it's easier if you have them.Already this cookbook has earned a central spot on my cookbook shelf.  I'm looking forward to many months of preparing new recipes from it.-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann",5,0,1834,0.178,0
2105,"If you are looking for an in-depth volume on brand management, the Little Brand Book is not for you.The Little Brand Book is a light read geared to women that asks the reader to take a brief quiz to identify her major and minor brand types-- pretty much the same type of test found in popular women's magazines.The bulk of the book provides an extremely brief discussion of the brand types within each major category (major category examples include maven, brilliant, explorer, gem and leader among others), followed by an interview with an entrepreneur-- most from fashion and allied industries--said to exemplify that major category.It was fun to take the brand quiz, and I found that some of the major categories and brand types resonated with me more strongly than others, which proved somewhat interesting. The interviews with entrepreneurs actually contained some good advice for women who are building companies.That said, this is a fast read more akin to a lengthened magazine article than a real guide to selecting and building a brand identity.

I was very excited when I found out that Dr. Bruce Betts had another book coming out and instantly ordered it.  I was so disappoitned and now I'm looking for someone to give it to.Again, I want to say that I have the highest respect for Dr. Betts and his first book was just wonderful.  As a homeschool consultant, I recommend it to every homeschooling family I know who is studying Astronomy.  But I have to assume that, given the success of his first book, the publisher demanded that he create a similar book for a younger audience.  This book lacks the integrity of his first.  Why?  Because there's a limit to how young you can go with a topic like outer space.  In Waldorf schools they don't even study it until sixth grade.This book feels like a hastily cobbled together assortment of very basic facts that you could find on the internet, combined with some art that is meant to look cute and a few outer space jokes.  There's so little content that most of it is presented in large colorful bubbles, presumably to fill up space on the page.  The content is very simple (""when astronauts leave an air-filled spacecraft they have to wear special clothing"") and when you make it that simple, you lose the vastness and gloriousness that makes space awesome.  It's the science of it that makes it cool.  Huge numbers in math, big ideas in chemistry,  and unanswerable questions in philosophy (like, where did we come from and is there other life in the universe).  When you take all of that out, you are left with -- as Charlotte Mason would say -- twaddle.Sorry, but this one is a miss.I received a free advance copy of this book from the publisher and am giving a non-compulsory honest review.",2,0,1815,0.192,1

2134,"Rating:  5 starsI was so happy to receive this book from NetGalley on Friday.  It was a tight turnaround to finish the book, and post a review by publication day on Monday.  (Eeek!)  I had tad bit of deadline anxiety before I received the book, but I couldn’t resist reading a new book written by Amy Harmon.  I am so glad that I requested the book.  The reading deadline didn’t turn out to be a stretch.  The book pulled me in at the start.  I read it two sittings.  It was that compelling.Ms. Harmon’s, “What the Wind Knows”, is one of my top five favorites books read in 2019.  While this versatile author’s name attracted me to this book, her writing sucked me in and did not let me go.  This work of historical fiction also has a strong romance element.  It’s the story of a wagon train heading out from St. Joseph, Missouri in the 1853.  The Oregon Territory is its destination.  The May family is the primary focus of book, especially Naomi May.  She is a 20-year old widow.  Her husband Daniel was the moving force to encourage his family, and hers to head west from Illinois.  However, he did not live to see them start their journey.Going along for part of the trip is John Lowry.  He is the son of a Pawnee mother, and white father.  His white father and stepmother raised after his mother’s death when he was about eight.  His father has built a successful mule breeding business in St. Joe.  The Lowry Mules are renowned throughout the region. They are prized for their strength, stamina and calmness.  John Lowry is travelling with the wagon train as far as one of the forts out West.  He will drop of the string of mules that have already been sold to the fort, and travel back to St. Joe.What follows is a tale of the hardships of life in a wagon train.  The daily struggle to log miles over unforgiving territory with the threat of snow in the mountains always spurring on the pace is real.  John tries to remain aloof from the wagon train folks.  He is a calming influence with the livestock and he helps where he can, but tries not to get personally involved.  Naomi however is having none of it.  She pulls John into the life of her family, including her four brothers.  Gradually they fall in love.John and Naomi narrate their own stories alternating throughout the book.  Their experience and struggles rang true to what I have studied about the Oregon Trail journey.  There is drought, and cholera, and floods, and encounters with Native Americans.  John is often put in the role of the mediator with the various tribes encountered with the whites either in the wagon train, or at the forts.  His Pawnee name is ‘Two Feet’.  We was named that because he has a foot in both worlds.Then a tragedy rips Naomi away from her family.  What follows is John’s devotion to her, and her devotion to her family.  The mountains he climbs, and the battles he fights to find Naomi is awe-inspiring.  While the obstacles are many, the story feels so real.  How John and Naomi work together to overcome grief and loss is told with heartfelt expertise.  I do not normally gravitate to romance novels. This historical romance felt real and true.  It wasn’t a bodice ripper filled will rakes and coquettes.  It was simply the story of two people falling in love and moving on towards a common goal.  They helped each other every step of the way.This book was a wonderful mixture of happiness, sadness, hard work, and learning how to live with other cultures.  I even shed a tear or two at some touching, (okay and sad) moments.  I do not know how Amy Harmon does it, but she continues to write stories that are richly drawn and compelling in a wide range of genres.I would recommend this to readers who enjoy Historical Fiction, and Women’s Fiction.  I would also recommend it to those readers who want to learn more about life on the Oregon Trail, and the pressures that the westward expansion put on the Native American tribes.  This aspect of the story especially well written.

Everything is Under Control can be a really quick read that you devour in one big bite or you can read it slowly, savoring every story and every recipe.  Written like an undated diary, it is a glimpse into Phyllis Grant's life as a chef, a midwife and a mother. While studying ballet at Juilliard Grant is told that she is just not good enough to succeed as a dancer so she decides to become a pastry chef.  She moves to various other positions in the restaurant kitchen before deciding, after the birth of her own children, that she was going to become a midwife.  Food is an integral part of this book but Grant  talks about her abortion, her eating disorder, and is extremely honest in telling the reader that she loved her daughter instantly but that loving her son took some time.

It’s about a housewife who suspects her new neighbor is something not quite human.  As things slowly begin to degenerate for her she finds out how dangerous this new neighbor really is. She ends up calling on the assistance of her book club for help. I  really enjoyed the beginning of this book, it was darkly humorous and highly entertaining.  As the book continues it just gets more and more creepy and flat out sad at points.In general I liked this and found it fairly engaging to read.

However, I did enjoy the irony throughout and the depiction of life in the late 80's, early 90's.Characters (4/5): The characters were fine but the majority of them are pretty ugly to each other in this book.  They weren’t my favorite but Patricia was pretty well done.Setting (4/5):  I enjoyed the small town setting set in the 80’s to 90’s.  It was fun to look back and see how much attitudes and the world in general has changed since then.  That’s the time period I grew up in, so it was fun to see it through the author’s eyes.Writing Style (4/5):  The book is generally well written and easy to read.  The first part of the story is fun and snappy, but it starts to get too serious and grim in the second half for my tastes.  This book also feels a bit long as a whole, but the ending feels kind of rushed.  A bit more consistent pacing and editing would have improved this quite a bit. Previous to reading this I had read “Horrorstor” by Hendrix which I really enjoyed because of the ironic gory humor throughout.My Summary (4/5): Overall I am glad I read this but it's not something I would re-read.  I also don't think I will read more of Hendrix's full length books because parts were just a bit too vicious and flat out yuck for me.  If you want to read a truly vicious vampire book this is the book for you.  If you don’t enjoy humans (and non-humans) being manipulative and vicious to each other I would skip this.",4,0,2292,0.171,0
2142,"I have the privilege of having been in the same class at college with my friend, Jane Mayer.  So, I read her books with deep interest and I always come away from them knowing a great deal more, being fearful and angry for the information I have gleaned, and terribly grateful for the work and research that went into informing me.This book is equally important as those books.  Ms. Kendzior does a considerable amount more editorializing, but she is almost entirely correct in her analysis.  So, she fills in more blanks and connects more dots, even if there is some sacrifice in objectivity.  I am grateful for it.  And the research is there in spades.I read this book and mourn for what she describes has been happening and what has made Donald Trump possible.  It reads as instruction manual for righting our faltering ship, or as a sign post on the downward spiraling path to our sad end.  In a way, the contents of this book are what has always been suppressed in one way or another, not entirely willfully, but more as a function of the way in which those in position to exploit our freedoms have exploited them.Buy it, read it.  Buy another copy and give it to a friend.",5,3,1177,0.1,1
2143,"I kinda thought this book was going to be a tongue-in-cheek, ironic look at what happens when a group of ""proper"" southern housewives has to defend themselves and their town against a supernatural threat, and it *is* like that, but it really does get gory- a half-decomposed elderly woman ripping off another woman's earlobe and part of her head,, swarms of zombie rats invading homes and eating dogs and elderly people alive, and an unsettling scene where a middle aged man sexually assaults a teenage girl (in detail) to try and ""turn her""- and all were written in detail.Just not the book for me at all.",3,0,606,0.048,1
2144,"I come to this book as an adult reader, so I might be a bit older than the target audience.  However, I found the book a quick and enjoyable introduction to the life of Susan B. Anthony.  Having never studied the history of her struggle for equal rights for women, the abolition of slavery, and women's suffrage, I learned just how heroic SBA was in her fight against the injustices and prejudices of the 19th century.  Her legacy looms large over not just women's rights in the USA, but also around the world.  While the book focuses on the events in Anthony's life, the overriding theme for me is the never-ending persistence in the face of opposition that was her response to a society ruled by and built around men.  She was unyielding on the need for women to be seen as equal to men, and for men to stop telling women their place in the world.  ""Mansplaining"" is not just a 21st century invention, and it shows that for all of Anthony's work, there is still progress to be made.If your young reader is interested in women's rights, history, and wants to learn about the legendary figures who shaped America, Teri Kanefield's book on Anthony is a good place to start.",5,0,1172,0.07,1

I know that there is nothing to fear and her suggestions will take me farther in producing the art I long to do.

The cast of characters is colorful, and the setting – summer camp – is so evocative, it’s capable of catapulting any former campers (young and not-so-young) down memory lane – warts and all!  This book is especially timely with so many kids out there wondering if they’ll even get to camp this summer.

I loved the iconic characters he created for SNL, the collaboration he did with Gary Shandling to create that show, the work he did with Larry David, and the co-writing he did with Billy Chrystal on 700 Sundays - and there were so many more.This book chronicles his path to be one of the greatest ageless and timeless comedy writers of several generations.  He takes us on a journey of 50 years and introduces us to the personal sides of many of comedy legends and comedians we grew up with.  It is a heartwarming and sensitive look at what and who inspires his comedy - and what inspires him.  He opens up his core and and lets us in to show the vulnerabilities that make him funny.  He tells of his successes and failures.  He is a real person who could be your friend. As a person of a similar age, I was transported to his world, as he navigated the culture changes and adapted to it, to keep us laughing.

2150,"Becky Eldridge has a gentle way of making the spiritual life look easy.  In this newest book she brings her own personal experiences.  She is very transparent in sharing her life, her joys and sorrows to demonstrate her points.  At the end of each chapter are very concrete exercises in which the reader can practice to apply what she discusses in the chapter.  She bases this book on Ignatian Spirituality and explains in simple language even a beginner will understand.  This book is user friendly and comes at a time when we are all self-isolating. This book allows the reader to get in touch with their God, His promises and His unconditional love for them.  In Chapter 14 she brings to life, just as Jesus had companions in his suffering, so do we.  This chapter fits well with our current times as well as Holy Week.  This book is not just to be read, but savored and prayed over.  There is no rush to complete it.  If something moves you as Ignatius would say, stick with up, and allow it to permeate your inner being.The Inner Chapel can be done anywhere and at any time.

I don't want to spoil any parts of this story for anyone else but I will say that when someone tells you their boundaries, respect them, regardless of why you think they have those boundaries.I've read all three books in this series and this was the only one that I felt I had to push myself to finish.",3,0,585,0.114,0

2153,"With a mixture of Jewish guilt and almost an apology for his talent, Zwiebel presents us with a long schlep to his well-deserved success.  Most comedians, especially Jewish ones, are filled with so much angst and insecurities, they are brilliant.  No one can turn a phrase like Billy Crystal or create a hilarious look at life as Jerry Seinfeld.I was somewhat familiar with Zweibel before and realized his talent when he was with Garry Shandling.  The author’s description of Shandling was spot-on; Garry was aware of his own brilliance but he was so caught up in turmoil, that a friendship with Garry and Alan could never follow a straight path.The theme of this book was friendship, its power and the fundamental need of all of us to capture a sense of belonging. Gilda, oh Gilda, what a joy, what a terrible loss.  Zweibel’s description of her brilliance and torment evokes sorrow.Robin, Zweibel’s wife, must be a saint.  She was encouraging and patient and knew exactly when to step back.  I bet they have the best kids.I thoroughly enjoyed the book and learned about his happiness and anguish.

2154,"At first I did not realize this was adapted for young readers when I grabbed it, and yet I don't see how it could have been blunted anymore.  I am a huge fan of Noah's.  He's intelligent, well read, articulate and a truly funny young man-and yet reading this you see how different his life was than one might expect.  I should say, I read this and thought of my own children and upbringing.  Because he was of mixed parentage and grew up in South Africa-he essential hid his parentage for years.  I played outside, he couldn't acknowledge his father in public for many years.  It was a truly eye opening story.As a mother, I really related to the sacrifices his mother made. Her desire to hide her child from the ugliness, but also to be honest with him about what he might face in this world.  Noah told these stories with the same aware humor and self awareness that he displays on ""The Daily Show.""  I laughed out loud more times than I remember, but I was also struck at the harsh reality I haven't had to face.I read parts of this aloud to my two younger boys-15 and 11.  They know Noah, but aren't as aware of him as their older brothers are, but they grasped the differences in their upbringings and what he faced-and from that we were able to have some really education discussions on apartheid, cultural differences, and how their lives are different than so many around them. For that alone, this book gets five stars.But this is truly a story of not only overcoming adversity, but embracing it and understand that it does indeed help shape who we are and who we will become.  I do think it takes a deft hand to not hit someone over the head with that sentiment, and Noah strikes that balance.  Truly a remarkable book.",5,0,1729,0.149,1
2155,"The best kind of historical fiction — a deep, richly painted, description of life in East Texas at the end of the Civil War.  It’s an everyday adventure story — not about mythical heroes but about people trying to reclaim their lives in the chaotic aftermath of a devastating war.Simon Boudlin — the titular fiddler — has simple goals after the war:  find a piece of land, marry a woman with similar desires, and make a living with his music.  But life after the Civil War is anything but simple.  The novel is gritty with detail painting the turmoil of that time with a full sensory experience.  While some semblance of government is trying to establish itself and put the country back together again, displaced and ruined people are scrambling to survive and make new lives. From my modern perspective life then was impossibly hard — but in this book it isn’t described in an emotional, complaining way. It just is the way it is.  This is the story of people getting on with it — making their way by whatever means necessary, while still not losing their way morally.Included are beautiful descriptions of music at the time: Simon’s lusting for new sheet music that he can’t afford, the way music draws yearning and memory from the new mash of people from disparate backgrounds, and the business side — how to get gigs, what needs to be played, and how to handle the drunks and disorderlies who insist on disrupting.If you liked The News of the World, you’ll be just as captivated  by Simon the Fiddler (in which, Captain Kidd makes a surprise, cameo appearance!)Beautiful writing that gets to essences.  Some quotes:“His worrying kept him awake. The country was in chaos, there were no rules, law was a matter of speculation, nobody knew how to buy land or put savings in a bank since there were so few banks, how to get a loan, register a title to land, or legalize a marriage, everybody was dubious about the new federal paper money, there was little mail service, and nobody seemed to know where the roads led.”“So he lived in the bright strains of mountain music and the reflective, running pool of the Irish light airs that brought peace to his mind and to his audiences; peace soon forgotten, always returned to.”“Every song had a secret inside. When he was away from shouting drunks and bartenders and sergeants and armies, he could think his way into the secret, note by note.”“He knew that he did not play music so much as walk into it, as if into a palace of great riches, with rooms opening into other rooms, which opened into still other rooms, and in these rooms were courtyards and fountains with passageways to yet more mysterious spaces of melody, peculiar intervals, unheard notes.”“His first problem was to find a girl who would fall in love with him despite his diminutive stature and his present homelessness.”“People always tired him, always had, always would.”“He was ragged, a man of a defeated army and at the dinner he had played his heart out in a borrowed shirt.  In short, very like the Irish.”“So it’s dog eat dog and Devil take the hindmost.  So it has been in human memory, wild places where the only law is the strength of your good right arm.”  He lifted his arm and made a bony fist.  “That’s how it is in all human memory. ‘Vastness and Age! and  Memories of Eld!’ ““You expect the government and the diplomatic corps to proceed at some foolish breakneck pace!  There are substatutes to argy over and rewrite! And meantime the politicians must be paid their stipends and their travel expenses.  Become wise, young man, and cynical, and life will be far more understandable.”",5,0,3612,0.117,0

Tossed in a laundry basket at birth by an empty-headed starlet, raised by the laundress who found him, but left him in the theater at night so she could sleep, and educated by a typically vain and pompous leading man (who was the only one to know he existed), August indeed had  the titular astonishing life advertised.A fast romp through New York from the 30s to the 60s, the best parts of the book are August’s classics inspired dialog and soliloquies.  He was trained in the theater (never,  in fact, leaving the physical building until he was in his teens), and he behaves like a character in the dramas he observed.  While the tone is light, there is a serious thread throughout — August craves family and belonging as most of us do, but has never been in a position to find it.  He adapts, he survives, but it’s often a lonely existence.I wouldn’t call the plot realistic in any sense, but who cares?

2168,"I couldn't decide how to give an ovreall rating to this book.  It is unquestionably beautiful.  It does what Sibley says it intended to do - short essays, fascinating general knowledge, not an ornithological education.The essays are interesting and easy to read.So what is my issue?In the first two days I have had this book I have ended up spending an inordinate amount of time (hours) following up researching some of the statements in the essays that can be only read as definitive statements of fact.  Several set off alarms.Take for instance the discussion of rictal bristles at the bottom of page 97.  Sibley quickly debunks the old idea that their purpose was to net prey, but then he goes on to state the function as eye protection.  If you go to his references in the back of the book you will see that Roger Lederer's 1972 Wilson Bulletin article, ""The role of avian rictal bristles"" is cited.  Go read Dr. Lederer's article.  While it points out that the rictal bristles sometimes appear to be arranged like eyelashes, it does not suggest that they function as eye protection.  In fact, Dr. Lederer, in his article,  ultimately speculated they are for sensory purposes.While there is a study with Willow Flycatchers that showed if you taped the rictal bristles down, the flycatchers had an increased chance of having small particles hit their eyes, and there is some evidence of a protective function,  I believe the consesus in the ornithology community is that the function is sensory not protective. I am going to make an assumption that most people who are planning to purchase this book will read it casually and/or use it as a coffee table book, and will not dig behind the essays.  If you fail to  follow up, you may walk away with misunderstandings.  That bothers me.It has happened with more than the one essay.  That bothers me too.What do I love about this book?  Kudos to David Sibley for including his references so it is possible to look to his sources if we question his statements.  Frankly I had a great time exploring and learning.  That was fun.

2174,"Engaging characters save ""The Lost Orphan: A Novel"" from becoming a typical period romance-mystery.  Stacey Halls brings her characters to life through the use of the first person narrative.  She gives readers two viewpoints - that of Bess Bright, the birth mother and of Alexandra Callard, the adoptive mother.While each woman evokes emotional responses in the reader, Bess may be the more sympathetic of the two, primarily because of the economic and social forces that she faces.  However, Alexandra, too, faces personal obstacles that cause her to become isolated and psychologically fragile.  Dr. Mead, a young physician, becomes the common thread that brings the lives of these two women together; this results in the conflict over the child Clara/Charlotte.As the novel reaches its climax and the mystery unravels, one must suspend reality to believe its conclusion.  This is an engrossing novel that is easy to read and will propel you through its story.  It does not, however, rise to the level of classic literature nor does it ring true in the reactions or actions of the various characters.",4,0,1102,0.139,0

Around the 80% mark the story had picked up so much that I was really glad my afternoon was free so that I could finish the book.  As I was reading I realized that I didn't really care for any of the characters (except the missing child) because they had all done something or had a secret that just made me dislike them.  The interesting thing though was that it didn't matter!  I still had to find out what happened to everyone. Normally when I don't like the characters I also don't like the story but that was not the case here.  This book was absolutely fantastic and anyone who likes thrillers/mysteries needs to pick up a copy the day this book comes out!Thank you so much to NetGalley and the publisher for a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.",5,0,1170,0.149,0
2176,"Loved it!  Connie Willis returns to the well she has drawn from so successfully in the past ....  the angst that the English incurred during the World War II Blitz of London ....  including the gems: All Clear, Blackout, and Fire Watch.  This time out she explores the plight of the rescue crews during and after each night of bombings.  The all pervasive stress and strain of hoping to find survivors, rather than corpses.  Along comes volunteer Jack Harker, who joins Mrs Lucy's rescue team during the evening, only to quickly depart before dawn, to return to his mysterious ""regular"" job. Jack has an uncanny and unbelievable knack of finding survivors buried beneath the rubble ...  undetectable to any other.  Is there perhaps a significance to his name ...  which invokes remembrance to one of the main protagonist of Bram Stoker's 1897 masterpiece: ""Dracula"" ???  Connie Willis miraculously weaves a compelling tale shrouded in mystery in this slim 112 page gem.

2190,"I finished this book several days ago and have been struggling with my review.  I always do with ARCs.  For some reason I expected this to be science-based book and not the loosely anecdotal memoir that it is.  I think I had that idea from a fleeting misconception of the author's prior works, none of which I have read.Once I settled into my mistake I was interested in the author's observations which I found amusing at times and odd at others.  Up to the beginning third of the book I'm taking mental notes on what growing old portends, trying not to catalog as much apprehension as I feel, when the author drops a bombshell.  At 87 years old the author admits to being a smoker (from the numbers she provides, a pack a day) for the many past decades.  That alone was enough to negate her observations.Another complaint I have and I have encountered it more than I'd like. Please, authors, stop putting your political opinions in books that have nothing to do with politics.

I must admit, when I started the book I wasn't pulled in as fast as I expected, however, as I continued reading I fell in love with the story (it didn't take too many chapters to engage me though so be sure to hang tight if you're not engaged immediately).  Sunshine and her daughter Auri are very well written characters and I already have thoughts on where I'm hoping their stories will continue (I don't like reviews with spoilers, so I'll just leave it at that).

2197,"In every one of Jen's books there's always a sentence that gets right to the heart of what I'm thinking these days. For this book it's this one (two) ""...loving people fits perfectly under the umbrella of loving God, so when 'loving God' results in pain, exclusion, harm, or trauma to people, then we are absolutely doing the first part wrong.  It is not God in error, but us.""  Thank you, Jen, for putting what I've been thinking in language others can understand!  This is what Jen does, she takes the thoughts of modern Christian women and distills them down to clear ideas and directions that we can all use to navigate this constantly changing world.  This is not really a self help book.  If you start out with your enneagram and feel turned off, just skip it.  This book is about engaging with the world in the way Jesus calls us to do.  Jen's distinctive writing style pulls you in and makes you feel like her best friend.  This would be off-putting if you thought it was just a marketing ploy, but the reality is that Jen is the same in life as she is in her books.  I was once at a conference where she spent 40 minutes telling a group of church leaders that they couldn't force people to volunteer and to respect people's boundaries.  The very first question when she was finished was a woman who basically said ""I hear what you're saying, but how can we force people to volunteer more?""  (I would have pulled a Hella ""Weren't you listening to a word I just said?"") But Jen answered the question like the woman was a pearl and her question was unique.  I have never seen a  speaker deal with a questioner with such love and tenderness.  I highly recommend this book for anyone who wants to explore how to deeply love (ourselves and others) as Jesus did.

2200,"Having read all seven of this author’s previous books I was very pleased to be given an advance copy of  The Best Friend (the third book in the Broden Legal series) by NetGalley and the publisher to read.For quite some time now Adam Mitzner has been on my list of “don't miss"" authors -- meaning that if he wrote it, I'll be rushing to read it — but with The Best Friend he’s risen to  near the pinnacle of this list. This is because The Best Friend demonstrates that Mitzner has, yet again, further advanced his skills for writing intelligent, credible, very hard-to-put-down thrillers/mysteries, with very well-developed characters.Without describing its plot, which can be read about in the Book Description above, The Best Friend shares — and in some cases surpasses —  many of the same qualities I felt were characteristic of each of Mitzner's seven previous highly recommendable books: 1) excellent pacing, which starts off slow and steadily builds to a level that will have you turning the pages at a rapid pace to find out what happens next; 2) creating highly realistic flawed, yet sympathetic, characters; 3) providing such true-to-life prose that makes you feel you are actually hearing the characters speaking their words; 4) having the main character and most of his secondary characters be so fully dimensionalized that you forget you are reading a book and not right there with them experiencing the turmoil in their personal and professional lives; and 5) providing some interesting plot twists.I think it’s obvious from my above comments that I highly recommend you rush out to read a copy of The Best Friend.

I have never been a big fan of vampire novels or urban fantasy so I was hesitant to read it at first but I am happy I picked it up and now I have a new author to follow.I'm not going to give a plot summary, you can read that above.  I had some of the same frustrations as a few of the reviewers.  The men in the novel were stereotyped to hell and back - perhaps that is intentional, you don't need to be a vampire to be a monster?  I was also thrown off by the time gap, I felt like it took away from the evolution of the main character, and the story itself.Other than that though there was a consistent slow build of suspense, the monster was actually a monster and I feel like the women behaved exactly as housewives would behave trying to take down a monster that only half of them actually believe is really a monster.Is it perfect?

It is not until she learns something nefarious about him that she decides to do something about her and her son's life.Garrett  had been in search of that one thing to make his life complete.  It is not until he meets Julia in a very sweet meet-cute that he is determined to be part of her life even if she is a little reluctant at first.

He wanted to play the role of protector, but what she wanted was to be independent and finally live the life she's desired ever since she became a widow.

This highly readable story is well crafted around the Ghetto in Ancona, Italy, with a nicely crafted love story and political arena that keeps you reading.

2229,"Following the publication of his 2008 encyclopedic survey of ancient Maya sites in in Mexico north of the Guatemalan border, Ivan Šprajc has become a fixture in the libraries of Maya central lowland archaeologists. Far from being an encyclopedia, his new book Lost Maya Cities is informative and entertaining in all its adventuresome aspects for everyone.  I say informative because bits of information such as that the fer-de-lance can bite through boot leather and will chase one, may explain why my Maya informant Don Roberto nearly went apoplectic when I wanted to go into an off-season garden (milpa) to see how the beans had done. The book is entertaining in many ways including a bit of personal fulfillment.  When my research group cored the seasonal swamps (bajos) around Calakmul in 2000 we crossed half way through El Laberinto Bajo at the city of El Laberinto and turned back half way having augured as many samples as we needed.  I have been curious ever since about Villahermosa, the next settlement on the map to the south.  It was interesting to see the rest of the trip to Villahermosa through Ivan's eyes, and then his group's persistent machete clearing on to Yaxnohcah, a spectacular site now being studied by Kathryn Reese-Taylor and her researcher colleagues.  Also on a personal note, it was nice to run into Raymundo, my colleague from the Autonomous University of Campeche and others I have known, and to meet other like-souls such as the ever clever and resourceful Ciriaco.  It was also nice to see how helpful the Mexican army was for Ivan and his intrepid band.  We all owe Ivan a note of gratitude for this unique perspective on doing Maya archaeology.",5,0,1682,0.095,1

In a time where a pandemic situation could very easily bring about the economic downfall of the world, Sansbury-Smith could not have picked a better time to debut his newest novel, Sons of War.Mixing mafia, politics, military, and paramilitary all into one novel was a bold move. One that I feel, as a reader, was brilliant.  It is exciting when an author moves from one genre to another and does it as well as Sansbury-Smith has done.This story follows a small community within Los Angeles through a cataclysmic economic and political breakdown affecting the U.S.  A father and son bent on protecting not only their wife and daughter/mother and sister but their friends, the innocent, and their country.  The mafia intent upon building an empire based on drugs, sex/human trafficking as well as death and destruction; the paramilitary bent on removing the power of the US government into their own hands all while riots and starvation occur.Vividly detailed, the plot and character development are flawless as are the plot twists!  The dialog is realistic and well done. Sansbury-Smith has a knack for storytelling and does so in a riveting style.

Or....just what is everyone not telling anyone?The ending will have you on pins and needles as Ruth continues with what she does best....making up facts, imagining things to be something they aren’t, and telling lies.  4/5This book was given to me by the publisher via Edelweiss in exchange for an honest review.",4,0,1224,0.033,1
2264,"Trying to fit in as the new kid in a different school can be a challenging experience for many children, including Lillian. The butterflies she feels in her stomach on her first day steadily feel like larger animals churning around as the week progresses.  The main culprit behind this anxiety is the upcoming Show and Tell: as the children bring in some rather impressive toys in preparation for the big event, Lillian grows increasingly worried because she has nothing comparable to bring in.  She and her mom had to move suddenly to a family shelter because of her dad's bad temper, and they left all their belongings behind.  Lillian's mother is saving every penny to rent an apartment and cannot afford to buy Lillian a new toy.  Only when Lillian comes up with a creative solution to her predicament and comes to terms with her current living situation at the shelter do the butterflies go away.The Magic Beads is an excellent example of a children's book that broaches a difficult topic--in this case, domestic violence--in a sensitive and age-appropriate manner.  The expressive illustrations work effectively to communicate the conflicting emotions that the protagonist feels.  Woven into the compelling story are some powerful economics lessons about scarcity, wants and needs, and the economics of conflict. This book offers a hopeful message that Lillian and her mother, who experienced extreme conflict at home and a change in living standards at the shelter, are able to find help and support as they transition to a new chapter in their lives.",5,0,1558,0.125,1
2265,"The novel was suspenseful enough to keep me involved.  As an estranged twin investigates her sister's murder or diaappearance, information about their relationship is divulged slowly.  The parallelism between solving the mystery of what happened to Angela, and what happened in their relationship increases the suspenseful nature of the book.  The setting of the catacombs was appropriately sinister.  Their were hints of gruesome events, but not overly graphic descriptions.",3,0,475,0.045,1
2266,"I have to admit I wasn't thrilled with this book and ended up skimming the  final 100 pages.  As the author states, ""This is not really a story about baseball.  It's a story about power.  A dictator on a Caribbean island decided he needed to rent the best baseball players to win a series dedicated to his 'reelection.'""  The author finally gets down to the series held in the Dominican Republic about half way through the book and Paige's team finally gets their act together when Josh Gibson and James ""Cool Papa"" Bell join the team.The rise and fall of dictator Rafael Trujillo is detailed and ends with his assassination in May of 1961.  The career of Satchel Paige in the major leagues with the Cleveland Indians and St. Louis Browns is dealt with at the end of the book.  Also included is a description of the various pitches that Paige had in his arsenal.I did find one error in the book.  Page 159 twice lists American League President as William ""Harbridge.""

2268,"The Adventures of a Girl Called Bicycle"" has it all-adventure, humor, drama, information and so, so much heart.  Bicycle has been raised by residents of a ""mostly silent"" order in a monastery in Washington, D.C.  She, naturally, chooses to speak very little until her desire to meet her cycling hero launches her onto a two-wheeled quest to San Francisco.  She meets a wide variety of characters along her well-researched route and each one of those contributes to her personal growth and the entertainment of readers age 9 and up.  Christina Uss does a masterful job of keeping her novel light-hearted and yet full of meaningful lessons on friendship, kindness, generosity, and perseverance.  Her writing is detailed without getting bogged down into the minutiae and characters are well-developed which results in huge buy-in for readers as they root for Bicycle to achieve her goal and for those she meets along the way to find what they are searching for, as well. ELA teachers could easily use this novel as a class read aloud and would find that a plethora of skills, such as theme, character development, cause/effect, and figurative/sensory language, just flow from discussion that will certainly ensue.  There is a joy and energy that seems to leap from the pages of this highly recommended book and having briefly met Ms. Uss at the 2019 Texas Library Conference's Bluebonnet Award speed-dating program, I can see her voice speaking through Bicycle.  She was such a pleasure to watch and talk to, not only the program, but as I waited in line in the Author Alley later.  I am anxiously watching for her next book and can not believe that this was her first one!!",5,0,1671,0.137,0

It seemed as if the author didn't have enough material to work with, especially the material between Frida Kahlo and his father, so he just filled the story in with politics and filler.  It got to the point where I couldn't tell what he was imagining or assuming, and what was actually factual.  Frida didn't come alive in anyway at all.  Very flat and uninteresting.  At least for me.

It is hard to believe this was written before the Pandemic, and riots.  Although media critiques have tried to spin this as Pro-Trump, it is not a book about Trump.  Certainly, President Trump and other leaders could gain from understanding the book.  It is my perception that this was really meant to be a self-improvement and leadership book.  He shares real stories from his own failures and victories.  He uses his own personal challenges, Navy Seal training, and experience to drive home valid points about life we all need to understand.  He does an excellent job with quotations and references.  He has a balanced approach to addressing the real concerns of the political divide.

If the writer,  a noble representation of scientific genius, could take time to pen her experiences  dealing with the powers elected, and some appointed, to rule over us, then the least we can do is read, or listen, or both, and we often can do much more. It is biblical, and commonly known that the love of money is the root of all evil; what is not commonly known is the extent to which leadership, according to the writer, have gone and is willing to go, to secure their love  for money over the love of the people they have sworn to serve and to protect.  Indeed, even to cause harm, not just to one or to some, which is bad enough, but to millions in some cases despite the science or lack thereof to support a course of action.

Krista Davis has a talent for developing characters that feel like your friends that you visit in each installment and her descriptions of Old Town Alexandria really paint a picture for the reader.  In this book Sophie is helping a congressman's wife finish her cookbook after her previous ghostwriter quits unexpectedly.  This was definitely a new twist to Sophie's career.  Although she is always making wonderful meals and desserts in the previous books, so this isn't too far out of her realm of expertise.  I love that recipes for some of the dishes are always included in the back of the book too.  Sophie notices some strange things happening in town and has to work to put the pieces of the many puzzles together in this one, but it comes together in a satisfying conclusion.

2283,"Phuc Tran’s memoir follows his incredible life that begins when he is a only a baby when he and his family flee from the falling city of Saigon.  Tran brought the harsh realities of fleeing a country to begin a new life in another country with only the clothes on their backs.  Growing up in a small town in Pennsylvania, I can imagine the difficulties Phuc encountered while trying to assimilate to other pre-dominantly white children in rural America. I was particularly struck by the way he described his lack of trust for his father after he told Phuc the incorrect way to pronounce Colonel. As children, we consider parents to be the authority on most subjects.  We often trust their advice, and blindly rely on their wisdom to navigate our world.  When faced with a parent-child dynamic where the child is rapidly expanding their education-as well as showing an increasing facility for their new language- it has to place both the child and parent in unfamiliar territory.  Phuc did an excellent job of describing these complicated situations to the reader in a way that allowed you to imagine the feelings of both himself and his parents.  As Phuc chronicles his formative years, he regularly draws correlations between the dominant themes of his life and some of his favorite books.  He also laid out his journey through discovering punk rock and the way it helped him gain confidence with peers, as well as develop his own sense of individuality out from under his father’s thumb.",5,0,1489,0.121,1

The Washington County Fair is just beginning, the carnival is setting up in each of the three time frames and the dead body of a pretty young woman is found on the same rural road near Miller’s Kill.  In all three cases her underwear, shoes, stockings and purse are missing. The police were unable to determine cause of death in 1952 or 1972 and Russ Van Alstyne and  the Miller’s Kill Police Department are facing the same dilemma with the third victim.  They are hoping that more advanced forensic testing in the present day will assist them in solving the most recent mysterious death and perhaps make connections with the 1952 and 1972 deaths.Russ and his police department are short staffed and facing a November town referendum that will determine whether Miller’s Kill will continue to have a local police force or if the State Police will assume all protection responsibilities for the community.  Nevertheless, the need to investigate and determine the woman’s cause of death and learn if or how the three deaths over 54 years are connected.  The final solution is cleverly developed and the guilty parties and the reason for the murders was a surprise to me.It was wonderful to discover that Russ has overcome his  misgivings about fatherhood during Clare’s pregnancy and is a loving father to their infant son, Ethan.  Clare is a caring mother and is overwhelmed with her pastoral responsibilities and lack of sleep as she is awakened during the night to nurse Ethan. Her demons continue to pursue her.

Angie is the head chef and in charge of the kitchen staff, and Felicia, who lives in the apartment above the restaurant, is in charge of the front of the restaurant, the servers, and the bar.  They have a great staff that feels like family, and the restaurant is doing well.  Angie has a St. Bernard named Dom, a goat named Precious, and a chicken named Mabel.

2299,"Death of an American Beauty is the third book in the Jane Prescott series by Mariah Fredericks.  The second book was excellent, and I was extremely excited to get my greedy little paws on this one.  If you haven't read the previous installments, don't fret; though they share characters, each story stands just fine on it own.  I unfortunately haven't had the opportunity to read the first book yet, but I wasn't lost in the least.  Series like this one has made me a huge fan of historical mysteries.Jane Prescott, lady's maid for Louise Tyler, is heading home for a week's vacation.  Where is home?  That would be a refuge for fallen women run by her uncle, who took Jane in when she was just three years old.  Jane is thrilled to begin her time off by going to an art exhibit featuring the shocking cubists.  (Cubism is NOT my style of art; give me a Van Gogh any time.). When an animal is found mutilated outside the gallery, Jane doesn't know it's a portent of things to come...  Jane's next plan involves the yearly dance for the women in her uncle's shelter.  All have a wonderful time, until one of the ladies sneak out.  Jane finds her, dead and mutilated; her appearance brings forth memories of someone from Jane's past .  If that wasn't enough to ruin a vacation, Mrs. Tyler enlists Jane's aid with costumes for a show by society ladies celebrating the 50th anniversary of the Emancipation Proclamation, to take place at the renowned Rutherford's department store.  When another women is found murdered and suspicion falls on Jane's uncle, she is determined to figure out who is committing these murders.This is one murder mystery that kept me on the edge of my seat.  I figured out whodunit numerous times; apparently detection isn't my strong suit.  I was totally taken by suprise.  It's the characters, though, who kept me so engaged.  Jane is a young woman, but she's seen a lot in her short lifespan.  She is smart, stubborn and caring of those in her sphere.  Her reporter friend Michael Behan makes his appearance; I still can't figure out the relationship between Jane and Michael, which intrigues me.  Mrs. Tyler is as sweet and shy as ever.  One of my favorite characters, however, was Leo Hirschfeld, a music hall pianist/singing waiter.  Oh, but Leo was handsome and charming!  He made me giggle, though I'm far from being a young lass.  At story's end we discover that Jane will be traveling to Europe with Mrs. Tyler.  I'm excited about the trouble no doubt awaiting Jane there!I received an ARC of this book courtesy of the publisher and NetGalley.

2300,"An “Innocent Bystander, The Killing of Leon Klinghoffer"", by Julie Salamon, is a sensational book. The killing, which occurred on the cruise ship Achille Lauro in 1985 by a Palestinian among a small group of Palestinians who had seized the ship, was motivated by the goal of creating carnage in Ashdod, an Israeli port, or having Israel release Palestinian prisoners, or both -  the Palestinians were not clear on the primary goal.  But both failed, and the Palestinians fled.The book is incredibly detailed as it tells the story of the ship's seizure, the killing of Klinghoffer, who was shot twice in the head and his body and wheelchair shoved into the sea , and the U.S. and Italian roles, but is far more.  It focuses on each of the victims of the story, before and after the tragedy, but again is far more. It has high drama, political intrigue and maneuvering, and as Salomon writes, the killing helped to “alert the public to the threat of terrorism, which still seemed remote to Americans in the days before 9/11.“Primarily through interviews, the reader learns the full measure of the grief of the Klinghoffer family, the feelings of the four Palestinian perpetrators, and the family of Abu al-Abas, the leader of the group, as well as the family of Alex Odeh, a Palestinian American who was murdered in Los Angeles in apparent retaliation.The book is a brilliantly written history with a most sophisticated analysis of the relationships involved.  I did not like the John Adams' opera, ""The Death of Klinghoffer,"" precisely because it was, in my view, missing those attributes.But this book is not to be missed.  And I hopefully await the movie.",5,0,1656,0.072,1

Peggy tells about her life with John in  such a loving but truthful way that the reader has a true picture of the wonderful man she married so many years ago. He may have some quirks but they only make him more endearing.  I have to admit, I recognized some traits of John's in my own father!This is such a refreshing and charming book!

It's a matter of action, not standing.""  Erica Vetsch is a fantastic addition to the realm of regency authors, and readers of Kristi Ann Hunter, Sarah Eden, and Julie Klassen will enjoy her book.

2348,This book isn't so much about the terrorist murder of American Klinghoffer as it is a criticism of the Republican Reagan government by a Democrat author.I also don't like the way she implies that murder by terrorists isn't any worse than ordinary murders in the U.S. or deaths from AIDS.I also don't like her view that Israel doesn't have the right to retaliate against the terrorist murders of Israeli civilians by killing terrorists who hide among Muslim civilians.This author should have made the fact that this book is about her political views.,2,0,549,0.02,1
2349,"This classic book is very much of its time.  To the extent that it illuminates a now-lost world it has merit.  But especially in this unabridged form, it is probably heavy going for the contemporary child.  Many of the episodes are drawn-out.  Heidi herself is a little unapproachable as rendered here and a few of the adult characters are caricatures.  But I can see that it would have a certain charm for a thoughtful child willing to enter into the antique spirit of the story with its themes of isolation and loyalty.",3,0,521,0.181,0

Can he help her and her son escape her tyrannical father-in-law?This is the second book in the First Comes Love Series and features Lady Julia Fairbright and Garrett Stockton.  Since her husband’s death four years ago, his father, the Duke of Sprogsfield, has kept Julia under his control by threatening to take her son away from her if she doesn’t comply with his rules.  Garrett is the owner of a successful shipping company.  He is the son of a gentleman, but stays on the edge of Society.  When he rescues Julia from the tree in St. James Park, their attraction is instant.  Their chemistry is sizzling and their connection is strong.  Julia is strong, independent, caring, and kind.  Garrett is intelligent, independent, kind, and becomes immediately protective of Julia and Chatwyn.  Julia wants more than anything to be free to live her life, raise her son, and be with Garrett, but she is afraid of the Duke’s reaction.  When Julia tells him of her plan to deal with the Duke, he agrees to help.  It turns out they have a common adversary.  Gone with the Rogue is a charming and entertaining story.  The characters are likeable (except the Duke and Mr. Pratt).  Julia’s four-year-old son is absolutely adorable.  The girls from the Seafarer’s School make a happy appearance.

2353,"I teach AP Literature in Garden Grove, right next to Little Saigon, and how I wish I could get all 120 of my seniors to read this irreverent, funny, thoughtful memoir.  Of course this book appeals to me--how could it not?  I always tell my students that I am, in my heart, still a ""chick from the '80's""--sans the giant Aqua-netted unicorn hair and even bigger hoop earrings.  And Phuc Tran simply understands that wonderful/terrible time in history, making it hilarious and poignant and painful.  And then, Phuc Tran bestows such love and gratitude to those teachers who pushed him along the way.  If just one of my students feels the way that Mr. Tran so obviously does about those educators, in his hometown, who inspired him, I will be blessed.  And how could this English teacher not be utterly delighted in the way the author uses those same books I teach today-- The Metamorphosis, The Iliad, The Importance of Being Ernest, to demonstrate how literature cuts through generations and class and race and still speaks to us, still teaches us, still makes us understand each other?  I wish I could kidnap Mr. Tran and stuff him in my classroom simply to point him out to my students--see?  Words have power!  See?  A story about a cockroach is not really about a cockroach!  See?  Something written a hundred years ago still has profound things to say and mean and change even in 2020. See?  You can still be cool and rebellious and love to read.  See?  Literature can save you. I think it, in many ways, saved Phuc Tran.But I want my kids to read this less for me and more for them.  Most all of my students are from immigrant parents.  Many, many of those are immigrants from Vietnam.  Phuc Tran with witty, introspective, honest insights, highlights the pain of all of us when we don't fit in.  He discusses how it feels to straddle two worlds--one of his home country and the one of the United States.  He ruminates about what it means to have parents who simply cannot understand the nuances of American high school.  He writes about true friendships, the great importance of music to teenagers, the ways we all go about trying to find a niche, and then how we wonder, once we fit in that niche, if it truly represents us.  He understands the angst and pith of being a middle schooler and remembers keenly the trials of high school hallways.  He is, what I teach,  a ""complex character"" is--one who is a fascinating mix of snark and punk  and scholar and wistful, sad leading man.For those who might be appalled that I want to recommend this book to high schoolers, I will tell you there is drugs and sex and cursing--all which, to me, makes for a rich, realistic,  honest tapestry that I hope my students never shy away from.  So, kids and others who love AP lit, read the book.  For those of you who want to explore the 80's punk scene, read the book.  For those who feel unseen or unacknowledged, read the book.  For those who feel as if they have to be one person at home, and one person at school, read the book.  For those who struggle with their name, their family dynamics, their place in the world, please, read this book!And, if you, for some inane reason see this review, Mr. Tran, and want to sit in my classroom as an example of why books and art and music and words matter, I'll save a place for you here.  : )",5,0,3333,0.157,1

2374,"Mrs. Lily Adler is a young widow, 26 years old, coming back into London society in “The Body in the Garden” by Katherine Schellman.  It’s 1815.At a party on her first night back she overhears what sounds like a confrontation between a blackmailer and his victim.  The blackmailer quickly turns up dead.  Mrs. Adler is soon determined to find out the why and the wherefore, because no one else is interested – the authorities have been bribed to look the other way.It does not take too long for Mrs. Adler to figure out who the murdered man was, and what he was doing at the party.  But who killed him takes a bit longer.  Luckily, she has a naval officer friend of her late husband to help with the investigation, to go where she cannot, as much of the investigation takes place in places a lady of quality cannot go, and thus the gentleman is handy.  Handy, that.  And she makes him promise he will share whatever he finds out.  That is also necessary for our story, obviously.A heiress is involved – one of mixed race, one who has come from the West Indies to find a husband, easier to do as a heiress.  There’s also the hint that stealing from the government is involved, and since things are still hot and heavy with “Boney,” that’s treason.  People die for things like this, and in “The Body in the Garden,” they do.And Lily comes under danger.  And of course, she has to give the speech about why she’s doing it and how the gentleman just has to understand that she’s going to continue to search for the killer whether he (the gentleman) likes it or not.  It’s a shame this has to be got through but it does.  But this is de rigueur for historical mysteries of any era – the heroine having to tell why she’s doing what she’s doing and how she’s going to continue doing it.  Seems to me we could do without all this, because it should be pretty much understood that these women are doing things way out of their lane, as it were, but, there ya go.Anyway, just when everything seems fixed, it all falls apart.  Luckily Mrs. Adler gets the ear of a Bow Street Runner, one who will listen.  And so, she has even more help to bring a murderer to justice.  Quite a lot of wonderful help, actually.The author does a very credible job of following the strictures of Georgian society with just enough of those plausible holes that allows Mrs. Adler her latitude of plot.  It of course helps immeasurably that she is a widow, and thus has more freedom in the face of it.  And in the end, she finds that she may have found herself her calling.

2375,"Bram Stoker's ""Dracula"" and Richard Marsh's ""The Beetle"" were both published in 1897.  Surprisingly, ""The Beetle"" outsold Stoker's novel three-fold in the first few years of their publication.  So why has this novel faded into relative obscurity? Because it does not translate well to modern times.  Where Stoker's novel still holds many chills for its reader, ""The Beetle"" is so dated with its blaring xenophobia and chauvinism that the things which are meant to scare us do little more than provide mild amusement.At this point you may be asking why, if I feel this way, did I give this novel four stars?  The answer is simple: it is a wonderful piece for its time and, if viewed through a historic lens, one can see why it was so wildly successful.  In many ways, one can compare it to ""Dracula"", what with its shifting narrators, tightly woven plot, and shape-changing antagonist.

We are quickly starting to realize that life without others to enjoy it with can be very dull.

Del Sol is a quirky and unusual place, where anything can and probably will happen.  But, surely not the first day of her new job.  Think again.  Besides dealing with a kidnapped rooster, there is a teenage girl missing as well.  So much for easing into the new job.A Bad Day for Sunshine is a hoot.  Like the story, the characters are quirky and unforgettable.  The dialogue is snappy, the mystery has enough twists and turns to keep things interesting, and the humor is perfectly timed.  The story is both heart-tugging and heart-wrenching, but always engaging. While I found some of the emotions that are displayed a bit redundant, because the book is so well-written, I can overlook that.  I thoroughly enjoyed the debut of this new series and will definitely be on the lookout for the next installment.Many thanks to NetGalley and the publisher for providing a copy of this book for review.",4,0,1064,0.221,0
2388,"My rating of 2 stars is a combination of plus 4 stars for fine writing by an obviously talented writer and then minus two stars for hypocrisy run amuck.Throughout his book, Mark acknowledges numerous potential causes of an apocalypse, from nuclear Armageddon to an asteroid strike to just about everything else in between.  Nevertheless, he clearly fears global warming the most and mentions it more than all of the other causes combined.  And, among global warming’s root causes, he sites capitalism most of all and denigrates it at every opportunity.  Hold that thought.He starts the book describing much web searching and YouTube video viewing about, among other things, doomsday ‘preppers’.  He then takes us on an apocalypse world ‘tour’.  The first stop is in South Dakota, to see old U.S. Army storage facilities now being sold as bunkers in which to hide and survive the end of the world.  Obviously, those who own bunkers would barricade themselves in and keep the rest of humanity out.  At this point, Mark takes the first of many ‘hypocrisy acknowledgment’ detours (which he also often uses to showcase his political correctness):“It seemed to me that this scenario … the haves battening down the hatches against the have-nots was in some basic sense how the world essentially was in some basic sense how the world essentially was, only more so. And though I was not certain about much, I was, certain that I didn't want to be one of the haves in a world like that. I knew there was some real hypocrisy in this: if this was already the arrangement of the world, after all, I was nothing if not a have. How could I be so sure that in the wake of some cataclysmic event, I would not be-would not, in fact, have to be-even more heedless of the suffering of others than I already was. Every single day in Dublin I practically stepped over the literal human bodies of the poor, the addicted, the destitute. I complained about the government that did nothing for these people, that had no intention of addressing the systemic injustices that necessitated their suffering, but I myself did essentially nothing to help them, aside from the occasional tossed coin, offered as much to alleviate my own guilt as to ease the suffering of the recipient. But in the end, it was absolutely true that I felt nothing but horror … A civilization that could accommodate a business (here Mark is referring to bunker sales) was a civilization that had, in some sense, had already collapsed.”Mark does this repeatedly throughout the book – stating how horrified he is with the state of the world, but then acknowledging that he personally does little or nothing to change it – and often does exactly what he is complaining about – and then acknowledges the hypocrisy of all of this.  I’ve bumped my rating up to two stars for his good self-awareness, but also note how frustrating it is to read yet another left-leaning manifesto where the author practices nothing of what they preach.  Instead, yet again, it’s all just complaints and demands that ‘the government’ should DO SOMETHING.  Mark would be much more credible, and his book wouldn’t be such a frustrating read, if he described what he was personally doing to solve some of these problems.  Sure, no one person can solve them, but to just complain without taking SOME personal action – ANY action – or worse, to personally do that about which he’s complaining, is the very definition of hypocrisy.Here’s another example.  Another stop on Mark’s apocalypse tour is Chernobyl.  During his tour, he realizes the evacuated city of Pripyat was being “… exploited, as the setting for a kind of perverse adventurism.”  Then, right on cue, he inserts another ‘hypocrisy acknowledgment’ detour:“I was being confronted, I realized, with a cartoonish avatar of my own disquiet about making this trip in the first place; these artifacts of apocalyptiana were on a continuum with the project I myself was undertaking. Was I any less ethically compromised because I had come in search of poetic imagery, or of sociocultural insight? Did the literary form of my intentions make the content any less exploitative? And did my determination to directly confront, on the page, exactly these questions make me, in the end, not less but more ethically culpable, in the sense that I was exploiting my own self-consciousness about exploitation for literary ends?”In fact, Mark is exploiting Chernobyl for his own CAPTIALIST ends – to write a book to generates royalties – more bluntly, to use Chernobyl to put money in his own pocket.  But, importantly (to him at least), he’s doing so while trying to hide his outright hypocrisy behind a fig leaf of self-awareness.  It calls to mind Al Gore’s (correct) warnings about global warming, but from a ‘top 1%’ carbon footprint base (at the time, Gore’s mansion, pool, pool house, and separate guest house consumed more energy in a month than the average American household did in a year).I kept waiting for the book’s ‘payoff’, where Mark described how this journey convinced him to change his own life – both to make his own individual contributions to solving the problem of global warming and to serve as an example to his readers.  This payoff never comes.  In fact, the only ‘change’ Mark seems to undergo is one of attitude.  Specifically, becoming a parent – and, again, hypocritically, adding two more human carbon footprints to an already overburdened planet along the way – somehow makes him LESS pessimistic about the future.Actions speak louder than words.  Mark’s words, while cleverly and often entertainingly constructed, run exactly counter to his actions – an all too common issue with left-leaning prognosticators.The book’s subtle is: “A personal journey to the end of the world and back.”  A more accurate one would have been: “A personal study of left-leaning hypocrisy, where nothing seems to have been learned.”",2,4,5906,0.06,1

It was refreshing to read about all the different types of personality..  There is no ""perfect"" personality and this is explored in this novel.  Everyone has their own unique set of behaviors and one is not better than another.  It  is time for women to embrace and take pride in their life journey.

The main characters were pretty solid and relatable.However, it was a story that had its beginning around 2040 (my estimate, based on how long it would take to design, manufacture parts, test and build a ship whose story picked up at 2150) and there were a lot of aspects to the level of technology these humans had at hand that are a strain to believe that it took only 20 years (from the present - 2020) to develop, such as thoughts controlling doors, advances in propulsion that makes it possible to have a huge orbit-to-planet shuttle that can fly as easily as a 747, not to mention carrying enough reaction mass to take off (vertically? The landing wasn't described but that must've been hairy) and reach the ship.One other odd thing: why are space-borne fighter ships equipped with retractable wings? 🤷🏻‍♂️Overall, this was an interesting story.

After reading Charley Davidson for many years, I was eagerly awaiting the next book from Darynda Jones featuring a brand new character.  I won't say the book was totally engrossing; as a first book in a new series it has to provide a lot of background and build a foundation for world building which made the book a little sluggish for me.  But I will say the pluses outweighed the minuses - (1) wonderful, competent heroine - Sunny; (2) mysterious, brooding gorgeous bad boy - Levi; (3) a mysterious group that may or may not exist; (4) hints of the paranormal; (5) a wonderful sassy teenage daughter - Auri; (5) several other teenage boys - Cruz and Jimmy and (6) a manhunt and a missing girl.

There is a 90-day program included with a ton of support including daily progress logs, homework, goals, affirmations and access to online hypnotherapy resources such as recordings.  To be clear, it’s not a book teaching how to merely hypnotizing oneself to instantly lose weight but a complete and comprehensive program that includes hypnotherapy as part of the process.  Like anything else, results will vary depending upon the individual.

She eventually takes her mother in to live with her, and while her mother’s short-term memory is compromised, we learn family secrets that extend back to the time before the narrator was born, and which shake up the narrator’s sense of who she’d always believed her mother had been.

Hitler allied himself with leaders of German conservative and nationalist movements, and in January 1933 German President Paul von Hindenburg appointed him chancellor.  Hitler’s Third Reich had been born, and it was entirely fascist in character. Within two months Hitler achieved full dictatorial power through the Enabling Act.  In April 1933 communists, socialists, democrats, and Jews were purged from the German civil service, and trade unions were outlawed the following month.  That July Hitler banned all political parties other than his own, and prominent members of the German Communist Party and the Social Democratic Party were arrested and imprisoned in concentration camps.

2424,Well I honestly wasn’t expecting to enjoy this book as much as I did.  I picked it up today to read a chapter or two and before I knew it I was on the last chapter.  Admittedly it is a short book probably more of a novella but it really was such a good read.  This is way different to what I’d usually read but I was hooked from the first page.  This isn’t a fast paced book nor is it one full of suspense but one that just moves along nicely.  A lovely descriptive book with great characters and a few laugh out loud moments.,5,0,526,0.258,0

2427,"I enjoyed this book on so many levels.  Fierce, Free and Full of Fire is a great encouragement and guidebook for anyone looking to grow in truth and authenticity in their lives.  I was challenged by the open honesty of Jen’s sharing her own personal growth stories and the wisdom she learned (and is still learning) along the way – it is so refreshing and one of the things I most love about her.  That and Jen’s belief that there is enough space for everyone - to grow, follow their dreams, speak their truth and become their very best selves is why I highly recommend this book.",5,0,580,0.337,0

Jen H. gives rightful due to the help she has received from other authors and tools like the Enneagram.

2429,"I love this book!  Set in England in 1813, this emotionally rich story checked all the boxes for me—a smoothly flowing, steady-paced, captivating plot; well-developed, engaging characters; and beautifully drawn settings.  Vivid descriptive language and sensory imagery add to the enjoyment of the read.  The prose is crisp and concise reflecting excellent storytelling skills.  Historical details are skillfully woven throughout the narrative.  The romance with its ups and downs develops sweetly despite secrets and personal struggles, and the faith element is infused effectively into the story.  I look forward to reading Ms. Vetsch’s second book in the Serendipity and Secrets series, The Gentleman Spy, releasing in July.  I thoroughly enjoyed this book and highly recommend it.I received a copy of this book in e-book form from the publisher via netgalley but am under no obligation to write a positive review.

2430,"Pamela Salzman’s new cookbook is great!  Coming our during the stay at home orders was a gift!  The recipes are healthy but delicious, and live up to the title, “Quicker than Quick.”  I picked up my copy yesterday, and with ingredients on hand, I made both the Grain-Free Peanut Butter Banana Breakfast Cookies and Sweet Potato and Sausage Soup.  I have 7 mouths to feed so it is not always easy to find recipes that everyone loves, and my first to choices from this new cookbook left everyone asking for more.  I plan to make the Bean Dip and Mexican Salad tonight, and again all with ingredients I have on hand already.  Each recipe has a section under the title that explains a bit about the recipe, and I love this feature. It helps me understand the recipe better, and also encourages me to think outside of the box.  Without the description for the Grain Free cookies, I am not sure I would have made them, but I trustedPamela’s description, and she was spot on.  This is a fantastic cookbook, and I know mine is bound to become a kitchen staple.  Thank you, Pamela Salzman.",5,0,1080,0.261,1
2431,"4.5-5 stars Thank you Netgalley for my free ARC of this book. Sue Monk Kidd has done it again! I loved The Secret Life of Bees and The Invention of Wings, and now I add The Book of Longings to my ""loved"" list.  Once again, Kidd has created a strong female protagonist in Ana, a young woman growing up in Jesus's time, a time where a woman was only something to be seen and not heard.  For Ana, having a voice and making sure that women's stories were heard became her longing, one that motivated every action she took for the rest of her life.Yes, in the story she becomes the wife of Jesus, and as a Christian, I wasn't sure how I was going to deal with reading historical fiction that played with that idea.  However, for the most part, I feel that Kidd has made it clear that her intent was not to retell the story of Jesus but rather to write a strong piece of fiction about the life of a woman who could have married Jesus and then use only the pertinent pieces of His story to fit into Ana's.The only issue I have with the story is that my belief in who Christ was and the way I understand Him from the Bible, I had a hard time with his being totally human in a couple of spots.  I won't spoil your reading of the book by elaborating.Overall, I found this to be a believable work of historical fiction because Sue Monk Kidd was able to build characters who we not only cared about but felt could have undergone the events that happened.  I will miss Ana and Yaltha and the other strong women we come to know and love in the book.  Treat yourself to The Book of Longings, yet another, beautiful work of literary historical fiction by Sue Monk Kidd!",5,0,1653,0.153,0

2442,"This story took me down a sometimes unexpected road with the two main characters, Angela and Eva.  After they both lost their husbands in a tragic accident, their journey through grief seemed to take two different paths and push them apart.  However, they come together to honor their husbands’ lives  by entering an Ultra marathon.  They realize that even though they are handling grief and loss in a completely different manner, they have much in common with their struggle. The character that I liked the most, however, was Sherry, their mother-in-law.  She had lost a husband and two sons, yet her faith in God remained strong even through her own deep grief.There’s some romance in this story, although it’s secondary to the storylines of Angela and Eva coming to terms with their loss.  This story took some unexpected turns, and at times I wasn’t quite sure what decisions these two women would make.  The race in New Zealand makes a beautiful backdrop for their story, and a touch of adventure made this a well-rounded story of loss, faith, and hope.I received a copy of this book from the publisher.

The author is gifted with weaving a unique story with some quirky characters, but she failed miserably at assembling a final tapestry.  Just as I was getting into the story and eager to find out more, Tyler slaps a big “The End” on the whole thing!  Was her publisher pushing her to meet a deadline?  Did she develop writer’s block? Is she planning on continuing the plot in another book?The book is advertised on Amazon as a novel, but it is more like a novella without an ending.  Actually, it is more like a short story with no satisfying ending.  This wasn’t so much a failure to launch because the plot did take off in an interesting, compelling direction.

And well, yes, he is over-the-top. but after all he is in Texas.There's a bad-guy trucker, but his wife, and the neighborhood they live in is peopled with folks really no better than him.And my final straw, was the Religious group and Pastor and his evil deeds.  Yes, there are bad Pastor's but the disdain for all Religion, well it got to be too much, for me anyway.

2462,"Five stars is not nearly enough.  I don’t even know where to start to describe this amazing, hilarious, suspenseful parody (of so many things, but especially) of Southern Housewives and Southern Hospitality – and probably of vampire stories although I’ve never read one before today (not even Dracula).  One caveat….I say hilarious, but some might be less amused by many aspects (see below).The book with its clever prose is all about surrendering common sense and logic to a tour de force portrayal of an earthquake in the comfortable lives of middle-class, Charleston ladies of the 1990’s (!). Ladies whose lives are consumed with homemaking, raising their children, and making their husband’s proud.  These are Stepford Wives by choice and not by design.The characters are exquisite, and I LOVED them all.  Through Patricia Campbell’s eyes, we are introduced to fellow desperate housewife ninnies, BF’s and fellow book club members, Maryellen, Kitty, Grace, and Slick, to their idiot spouses, to Ursula (Mrs.) Green the only main character of color in the novel and definitely NOT a ninny, and James Harris (well he wasn’t so lovely but he was deliciously evil).  We meet these women as they are disengaging themselves from a seriously restrictive Literary Guild led by the arrogant Marjorie Fretwell (“the Literary Guild of Mount Pleasant was not fooling around”).  These women do not want to read Cry the Beloved Country – they want to read crime novels about passion and death in the suburbs; so they form their own book club where they can escape their daily routines at home and have conversations with adults for a change (Girls Just Want to Have Fun - Lauper).Patricia returns home from first meeting of new club and finds that son, Blue, has not removed the trash to the bins (oh, this book is loaded with astute reference to funny, typical parent/adolescent controversies and especially adolescent rebelliousness).  She takes the trash out and is attacked by a wild, rabid-like neighbor, Mrs. Savage – OMG this is the first one of the most graphic descriptions of putridity in the novel.  Mrs. Savage violently attacks Patricia chewing off her ear (that is the least of it) and is finally subdued and pronounced dead several hours later.  Patricia survives and then we follow her on her epic fateful journey beginning with her quirky introduction to Mrs. Savage’s grand-nephew, James Harris.  Patricia’s exaggerated southern hospitality is manifested in her inability to say “no” to anyone, and to be cordial at all cost and any event to everyone.  Harris, who moved into his great-aunt’s house after her death, takes full advantage of Patricia, and what follows is a sequence of events (some hilarious and some suspenseful) that will test her self-belief and self-worth before reaching the final climax at the end of the book.The author creates suspenseful events throughout the novel that leave you squirming at the edge of your seat, slowly twisting the spring taut and then releasing. We watch angrily as Patricia buries herself deeper and deeper, how her best friends are at once won over by her arguments only to betray her later on, how her husband humiliates her with his condescending and controlling actions, and how James Harris manipulates her and bests her at every junction.  I squirmed as much during the shaming scenes as I did during the graphic horror and suspense scenes.Despite the above, the book is funny, the circumstances the ladies find themselves in are hilarious (except when they are not).  These women are 100% dependent on their spouses, they are subservient and cowardly  – yet in the end they show courage, defy their husbands (albeit, behind their backs) and use all of their talents to get the job done right!",5,0,3755,0.166,0

As she explains, being read to from day one increases, exponentially, your child’s ability to be successful in all aspects of their life.One key factor that Kim stresses is choosing to put down your smart phone and connect with your child through the shared adventure of reading a book together. You cannot gaze into your child’s eyes, or them into yours, if you’re both looking at your devices.  It’s also way too easy, in today’s online world, to abdicate one’s parenting role to “age appropriate” (or not) virtual programming.And if you’re struggling with how much “screen time” is appropriate, Kim delivers excellent guidance on the topic along with recent supporting data.You are your child’s first teacher, which Kim succinctly has woven between the lines.

2480,"This is a winner!  I've read numerous Lincoln books over my seventy-eight years.  I rank 'Lincoln on the Verge' among the very best of them (e.g., David Donald, Eric Foner,Doris Kearns Goodwin, James McPherson, etc.)Professor Widmer is a prodigious researcher as well as an inspiring writer.  He has a firm grasp on his topic and has rendered it elegantly.  He framework, the 13 day journey from Springfield, IL to Washington, DC, never sags.  One chapter is better -- and quite different -- from the next.  (Each chapter focuses on the specific location that Lincoln stops overnight, such as Cincinnati, Pittsburgh, Albany, Manhattan, Philadelphia, etc.)'Lincoln on the Verge' is filled with delicious findings that the author has uncovered.  But most important of all the author narrates the story compellingly.  I especially have enjoyed Widmer bringing a host of well-known characters into the book (e.g., Walt Whitman, Millard Fillmore, Alan Pinkerton, John D. Rockefeller, Fernando Wood, and several others.)I've been rushing through my daily reading of the 'NY Times' and the 'Chicago Tribune' so that I am able to read another chapter each evening.My sole disappointment with 'Lincoln on the Verge' is that the book came to an end after just 500 or so pages!Three matters that the author might have noted:  (#1) Lincoln's party waited a very considerable time before the ferry conveyed it from Manhattan to New Jersey; (ii) long ago the historian Wheaton J. Lane rightlfully labelled New Jersey as 'the great transit state.""; and (iii) overlooked by Professor Widmer is Lincoln's heartfelt wish to travel with Mrs. Lincoln by rail to California upon completing his term office office as president (consult Herndon on this.)An unforeseen bonus for readers:  The author has a grounding in the Greek classics and he invokes them here and there beautifully.Professor Widmer should clear his calendar for the spring of 2021 when major literary prizes are bestowed.

2481,"This third volume in Scalzi's epic trilogy does not disappoint. Political intrigue and Machiavellian machinations persist unfettered. The fate of humanity remains in jeopardy!  The multiple star systems composing the Interdependency Empire are in danger of extinction .  The interconnecting Flow streams are collapsing and threatening their permanent separation.  The interstellar habitats are not self sufficient and are eventually doomed.  The present Emperox Grayland II, the 88th in a centuries long line of succession, is the supreme leader, and head of both  Church and State.  She has already survived two attempted assignations mitigated by leaders of the entrenched megacorporations run by century-old families that have controlled the mercantile economy, who thirst of even greater wealth. While Grayland II and her science officers are desperately attempting to find a solution to this overwhelming dilemma, the opposing families are concerned about  profiting from the impending chaos and continue with attempts at another coup.  John Scalzi continues to astound while weaving another narrative brimming with twists, turns and exceedingly unexpected events culminating in an exhilarating denouement.  His snarky humor enhances his world building and characterization skills.  His escalating pace drives the reader to a frenetic speed to arrive at a complex conclusion.

2482,"Back in the mid to late 1960's I had occasion to go to the Fillmore West and Winterland on numerous occasions to see Jefferson Airplane live.  Unlike many people, however, I spent little time watching Grace Slick and Marty Balin. Although they were among the finest vocalists in the history of Rock, I was drawn to the instrumental core.  This included the fine and subtle drummer Spencer Dryden, the Yggdrasil bass player Jack Casady, and my favorite performer, the tall lean, almost spectral lead guitar player, Jorma Kaukonen.  To my mind Jorma was the best guitar player I ever saw; better than the hirsute, stocky Jerry Garcia, better than the equally spectral John Cippolina, and much better than the solid journeymen Eric Clapton, George Harrison, and Keith Richards.  Sadly, I think may have been alone in these thoughts, because Kaukonen did not even make the absurd Rolling Stone top 50 guitar player list.Jorma readily moved from folk to blues and was one of the most imaginative rock players.  His use of feedback was as good as anyone, including Hendrix, and he was one of the only players I saw who knew how to use a wa-wa pedal in a way that actually added to the overall sound. Because of my enthusiasm for his work on electric guitar with JA, I was surprised to learn in his memoir Been So Long, that he considered himself better as an acoustic folk and blues guitar player.  This explains much of his work with Hot Tuna and all of his solo work, which I enjoy, but to me his electric work stands apart from all but Hendrix (and maybe Henry Kaiser).  He had a much wider range than the excellent but limited Duane Allman and Dicky Betts.  Only Clapton, and maybe Jeff Beck, match his range in blues and rock, and neither seem to have his finger picking skills in folk and country blues.Given all this, no one should be surprised that I was very enthusiastic to see the publication of Been So Long.  Having said that, I can also say that the book is not what I expected, and this was my failing, rather than Jorma's.  Jorma is telling us about his entire range of experience, of which the Airplane was basically, 10% of a long and productive life.  He is very kind in his descriptions and assessments of all of his former band mates.  One thing i was pleased to note is that he now seems to acknowledge that Dryden was probably the best drummer with who he has worked, especially across a series of albums. One factor, of which i was unaware was how troubled his family life was, both with his parents and brother, and later on, with his wife of some 20 years. In my naivete, I was also unaware that he was a heavy amphetamine user during his Airplane years, although this explains his lean, almost skeletal appearance in those years. Today he resembles a congenial, retired Nordic Hell's Angel, with his short hair and abundant tattoos.A number of reviewers have mentioned boredom with his lengthy discussions of motorcycles and cars. This is who Jorma is however; he seems to be an expert carpenter and mechanic and he has done superb work which explains his fascination with the construction of guitars.  He seems to have more understanding than other guitar players of how a guitar is put together and he provides a complete set of specs for his own artist version of a Martin acoustic guitar.  As I read the book, I became convinced that i should set aside my own expectations about inside gossip with Jefferson Airplane and began to settle into the rhythms and smaller accomplishments of Jorma's expansive and accomplished life.  I found it reassuring that he seems to be content with the life he has now, clean and still playing.  Jorma has always had a strong traditional streak, a reviewer of the First Hot Tuna album, described it as being ""a collection of Dave van Ronk's greatest hits"", although it is much more than that.  My current collection has 13 Hot Tuna CDs and 16 Airplane CDs, so all I can say is ""Jorma, thanks for your body of work.  You have helped me through some tough times, and it saddened me to realize they may have been even tougher for you. I still hold dear my memories of watching you and Jack and Spence producing some of greatest rock I have ever seen.

By retracing the steps from which we came, to where we are, Beck shines a bright light on the insidious lies that infiltrate the concept of socialism.He begins by coming up with a definition: “any of various economic and political theories advocating collective or governmental ownership and administration of the means of production and administration of goods” (pg. 4) and then proceeds to go back to the first experiment of collective socialism in this country to be, the Pilgrims from 1620. There’s and exhaustive dive into Karl Marx, the fine line between socialism and communism, all the little tweaks on “social democrat” and of course, Bernie and AOC.Beck provides lots of statistical information.  He’s not just ranting and supposing.  When he lays out the reality of what’s happening in Sweden, Denmark, Finland and Iceland and compares it to India - yes, India, well, that was just a draw dropper.  Those Scandinavia countries are the barometer by which we’re to fashion ourselves; not so much.There’s a lot of entertainment value in this book: big colorful blocks for key points, red letter emphasis points and best of all, Glen has 3 sidekicks that are his straight people thru the book, feeding him lines along the way.  They’re animated mash ups, I’m not telling who they are, get a book and read it.By far, the most useful and informative book on issues plaguing our government in a long time.

2516,"'ARC provided by both NetGalley and The Publisher in exchange for a honest review'**'Sometimes a single sentence or just a good dialogue can be enough to fill the imagination completely: And sometimes a book's title is enough..'I must say that I'm real gullible for any story that incorporates both intrigue & Love as one of the characters, and then as an important cog in the wheels of the narrative. And that's what 'PURSUING PANDORA' does and more on every page; where Pandora appears to readers, as fascinating, conspicuous and forthright at a moment's notice --- while Winter is astute, unfairly manipulated and has a charming personality. Add to this, Winter's ability to love her friends, families: both good & antagonistic, and Pandora: even with all her inherent secrets & mysterious background -- also makes her a deep and sometimes provocative protagonist for this storyline.Furthermore, everything else that's alluding to the entire storytelling does culminate with it being the perfect backdrop for such a sensual, friendship & family driven and emotional ride that both main character had to endure to finally end up being together.This book that Ms.Brown has written will definitely draw all interested readers in and that perception of any emotional turmoil it evokes might even stay with you long after you put it down.Highly recommended!",4,0,1355,0.207,1
2517,"What an enlightening and inspiring page-turner! Even though we know how this book ends from the title—Jeremy transitions from being seen as a girl in his youth to claiming his identity as a boy as a young adult—the emerging of his awareness and embodiment of his boy-ness took many steps, and I kept reading to find out what they would be.  As a reader, I felt taken along with him on his journey, deeply invested in his struggles and joys, and let in on the nuances of gender identity.  The author, Jo Ivester, included not only Jeremy’s perspective but her own journey as well as the experiences of her husband and Jeremy’s brothers and sisters, so the final effect is a skillfully woven family memoir.  This is a transgender story with the ideal family – prosperous parents who have created a stable, loving family of four children, a mother who was a civil rights activist and rebellious tomboy, uncles and aunts who were gay, a father who stands up for LGBTQ  equality alongside his wife, and a family who wanted to be accepting of Jeremy’s changes. But even this family faced personal struggles to get to that acceptance, and political struggles to make sure that their transgender son would be safe.  Their story highlights both the value of family support and the continuing need for cultural understanding and political protection, so it was inspiring that the family became advocates for the rights of all transgender and LGBTQ people, especially those who do not have the support of families like theirs.",5,0,1515,0.2,1
2518,"Juliette Hyland's first Medical Romance Novel should definitely be on your summer reading list! This was an easy and fun read that was hard to put down.The character development of the main characters alone was probably my favorite part.  When we first meet Rafe, he comes off as a celebrity doctor that has it all together. Rafe is going to Alaska and doing a favor for a fellow colleague.  He is also taking the time to diversify his social media and hopefully gain more of a following to be a permanent doctor on a panel for a talk show.  As the story develops, we also find out why Rafe wants (or what he believes, needs) to be celebrity doctor.  When we meet Annie, at the same time Rafe does, she comes off as a hardworking, dedicated and strong-willed doctor who needs a partner to help her with the medical practice while her colleague is away.  As the story develops, that part that we first meet of Annie is true and constant.  But we also learn that her past still haunts her and in some ways stops her from moving forward.Hyland is an excellent writer and the way she balances the story line, the medical aspect of the story, the romance and how it affects the character development is perfect.I hadn’t read a story like this before and I was eager to read something different.  This novel did not disappoint.It made me laugh, left me in suspense, and had me cheering on both of the main characters from start to finish.",5,0,1432,0.185,1

2536,"Reading this book made me feel sorry for ALT.  He is obviously very bright and ambitious, and both of those things served him well, for he has had quite an amazing career in the fashion world.  In part, this book is him celebrating himself and telling you that.ALT in some ways understands himself and is happy to tell you about it.  This part of the book is genuine.  His love of fashion, his sponge-like habit of absorbing all of the details so he is a walking Encyclopedia Brown of fashion history.  His deserved pride in his success given he was not to the manor born.  If you like fashion, this aspect of the book is wonderful and makes it worth the read.Otoh, in so many ways it is apparent that ALT does not understand himself at all, and he goes for the easy explanation (this bad thing happened because of racism; this person cut me off because they do it to everyone; this person turned on me because they do it to everyone).  And this means that there is an undercurrent of undeserved bitterness that runs throughout the whole book that seems too too much given what he's talking about is a world and echelon of people most of us could never even get near.  A few examples:1. ALT blames racism on his being pushed out of WWD.  The story he tells is that he betrayed Yves Saint Laurent (& by extension Pierre Bergé) by praising Givenchy in such a way that it hurt Yves Saint Laurent who up until that point had both helped ALT immensely and didn't make ALT pay for maintaining a relationship with his arch-rival Karl Lagerfeld.  So of course Yves Saint Laurent via Pierre Bergé complained to John Fairchild of WWD and ALT needed to resign before he was let go.  He didn't lose his job at WWD because of racism, he lost his job because he betrayed Yves Saint Laurent!  ALT didn't understand the world he was living in because given the incestuous relationship between designers and the fashion media, John Fairchild was forced to either push out ALT or lose all of WWDs access to Yves Saint Laurent, which at that time would have likely ended the publication.2. ALT thinks he was uniquely subjected to abuse such as racist remarks.  He tells a story about a nasty nickname given him by a rival for Karl Lagerfeld's attention and fair enough, it was an awful thing to say and in his shoes it would have made me hurt, furious, and insecure about my status too.  But ALT seemingly doesn't understand that he was surrounded mostly by women and gay men, all of whom got the same treatment, because that is what people do when they want to take someone down with words, they go for the cheap shot.  If there is a place where people would understand, ALT was in that place, but instead he acts as if he was some sort of other they tolerated until they turned their backs on him.3. ALTs beef with being rejected by Anna Wintour: He did nothing wrong! She does this to everyone! To ALTs credit he didn't go low about this story, he just explained how it hurt then and now, and he misses his friend.  But alongside his ""falling out of favor"" two other things were occurring.  First, ALT's eating disorder was running his life to the point that he could no longer indulge in fashion, he had to have special coats, capes and muumuus made for him.  Anna Wintour tried to help him with that, on the company dime no less, but he doesn't seem to understand that like with all addicts, at some point you have to stop enabling them and walk away.  He doesn't understand that his own inner turmoil that came out as binge eating and being morbidly obese was not only too hard to be around, but also it made him someone who wasn't doing right by the very fashion and friends he purports to love.  (And dollars to donuts this same dynamic explains the rift with Karl Lagerfeld, too.) Secondly, everyone in media by the early aughts knew the internet was coming for them, it was a time of media disruption that has since become cataclysmic, and it meant media personnel needed to prove their value  - ALT admits that more often than not, his photo shoots for Vogue did not run.  For whatever reason, his vision wasn't the editor's vision and instead of adjusting, he doubled down.  No one keeps a job that way whatever industry you are in.4. His complaint that everything is racism and blacks in America and Europe only get to experience anything after it is filtered through a veil of whiteness (or something like that) seems overwrought given that the entire book is an extravaganza of name dropping about his fabulous friends, and the fabulous dinners, and the fabulous clothes, and the world of money, fashion, money, luxury hotels and on and on and on.  At some point you have to think, where is the racism? These people accepted you wholeheartedly.  They were kind to you.  They helped you. They respected you.  Look at the blurbs on the book from the fashion people in support of you.  At a minimum, if the people you surrounded yourself with for 50 years were really that awful, then why the affected speech such that if I didn't know who the author was, I would think I was reading an off-shoot of Dominick Dunne's The Two Mrs. Grenvilles - as in ALT's voice in this book is the posh, snobby, NOKD talk that those in the fashion world apparently do adopt.  I had always thought that was a trope but apparently no, it's sadly real.  But if the fashion world is racist and you think your friends and colleagues are racists, then why adopt their language of snobbery that is designed to one up each other, and make people feel less than (i.e. their behavior isn't racist, it's how they treat everyone).Clearly I have strong feelings about this book having written such a long review.

The character development is great as one is able to picture each character and really get a feel for that person.Thanks to NetGalley for the ARC.",5,0,931,0.169,0

Perhaps it will be useful to someone who hasn’t heard his podcast, or listened to him on other podcasts.  The associated videos were extremely disappointing, as they were largely infomercials for his online courses, not a deeper dive into the content.

2551,"It’s one thing to collar a Christian and hand them a list or a job description:“Hey, did you know that you are to engage with the culture as a theologian, pastor, bridge-builder, story teller, translator, caregiver, reconciler, peacemaker?”Each contributor to Uncommon Ground has interpreted his or her own calling or story in light of the role God has asked them to fulfill, using the gifts, abilities, and opportunities he has provided.Christ’s death and resurrection has empowered them and will empower us to engage the world we find–not on the basis of our political party, race, or other aspect of our identity more superficial than the bedrock of our identity as a Christian. In spite of all evidence to the contrary, Christ continues to reign in the world. The twelve essays of Uncommon Ground were a bracing reminder that should transform my interaction with the culture going forward.Making sense of our lives in light of the gospel involves an understanding of our role as a sinner, rescued by grace, and neither better nor worse than others. “We bear witness to the gospel from a position not of strength but of weakness.” (596) As we tell and retell “the story that weaves together divine transcendence and earthy human experience” (1031) we bear witness to a kingdom that has come while offering hope that the kingdom is also yet to come in all its fullness for all to see.Many thanks to NetGalley for providing a copy of this book to facilitate my review, which, of course, is offered freely and with honesty.",5,0,1523,0.139,0
2552,"Having been a church pastor for many years, I  thought I'd burned out on, and didn't believe I could enjoy, even one more fictional account of the life of Jesus.  And this is not one!  This is an amazing telling of the life of a woman who had a great longing to have her own voice.  And, she happens to have been the wife of Jesus. Her story covers the time of Jesus' teen and young adult years, mostly up to the time he began his ministry in the Galilee.  Ana is  a story teller, writer, keen observer of life and in the end a librarian.  If you think the idea of Jesus having a wife is some horrible heresy, be relieved to know that this story doesn't go there.  It is a wondrous story of the details of the lives of a number of the lesser known women in the New Testament, and it is told during a time when women were set aside, used, sold, ignored, and considered thoroughly second-class as human beings.  This is the story of a woman who refused to accept that.  Enjoy it!",5,0,977,0.105,1

If so, Put Your Dream to the Test by John Maxwell could be a great resource for you.I was already familiar with John Maxwell, though I hadn't previously read one of his books.  In this volume, he presents ten questions which, if answered properly, will help you to accomplish your dream.  Each chapter covers one question in detail and includes a real-life example of someone who reached their goals.  Questions at the end of each chapter allow you to assess how you are doing with that particular aspect of your dream.  At the end of the book is a ""Dream Map"" which gives further opportunity to delve into the material covered in each chapter.The book is well-written, sharing information in an interesting and understandable way. It's motivational, yet gives practical ideas for implementing the principles presented.  As I read through the book, I saw the immediate application of it in terms of career dreams and recognized how beneficial it would be in that arena.  However, as I neared the end of the book, I realized that I could apply these same questions when it comes to my ""dream"" as a mother - that our two daughters will grow to be women who love and serve Jesus Christ.I was provided with a complimentary copy of this book by Thomas Nelson Publishers.

2568,"Head Over Paws by Debbie Burns is the 5th book in her wonderful Rescue Me series. Once again, Debbie Burns gives us another wonderful sweet story as we return to the High Grove Animal Shelter, where we also get to see many of the people we got to know in the previous books.Olivia Graham, our heroine, is traveling in a rain storm to try to get to the Animal Shelter to help transport dogs and cats to the shelter because of the flooding.  When her car breaks down, she meets Gabe Wentworth, our hero and local veterinarian, who picks her up, on the way to the shelter.  Gabe had his dog, Samson with him, who immediately fell all over Olivia; of course, Gabe himself was also attracted to the beautiful redheaded woman in the car with him.  The feeling is mutual, as the sparks flew between them very fast; and since both are animal lovers, it was a match made in heaven.There was an amazing rescue attempt of a dog in danger of drowning during the flood, that Gabe and Olivia desperately worked to save him.  There were many hold your breath moments when we worried about Gabe, as well as the dog.  In a short time, Olivia found herself falling hard for Gabe, as well as the rescued dog, Morgan, whom she wanted to adopt. Olivia is a teacher, and though she was falling in love with Gabe, she wasn’t sure she would stay in town, since she needed a teaching job.  I loved them together, as they made a great couple, and also enjoyed the occasional POV of Morgan.  Cute.  Will Gabe convince Olivia to stay?What follows is a wonderful sweet romance between Gabe and Olivia, with added the element of Samson and Morgan; and meeting Olivia’s sister Ava, as well as the characters we already knew from the shelter. Head Over Paws is a heartwarming, delightful, sweet romance with two very relatable people, involving an animal shelter and two adorable dogs.Debbie Burns gives us another wonderful, delightful, sweet, heartwarming story that kept us hooked until the very end.

I found True Believer in a used book store after hearing about the book from a Stratfor Fred Burton interview just before book 2.  I was hooked.  My point is you can see the progression and all that to say Savage Son is a great great read Jack has hit a high mark as a writer now on par with Brad Thor, who he credits this book too.  By now we know our characters  as readers are invested in James Reece we are ready for the ride.  Carr has a specific style letting us know or the types of gear and guns used.

There were three (or perhaps four) unrelated plot lines: rogue government players, oil & gas villains, church/cult and small town boom/bust players.

And this book did not disappoint.Like her other books, there's science involved - I'm not a science person, but it's clearly enough written that I get what she's explaining.  Hey, makes me feel smart!  Her characters, as usual, are interesting and well developed - even minor characters in the book feel real.  Mixed motives, people who are not saints or demons, people who I understand.  I may not agree with what they do, but what they do makes sense in the context of the book.And, most of all, her books always make me think.  Even if I start the book with a specific preconception (like about GMO food), she makes me re-think my preconceptions. I like reading that challenges me and makes me reconsider my own biases.

Another was my realization that David Crosby is the American version of Keith Richards, still here in spite of his attempts to do otherwise...and remembers it all.Crosby's brilliance as a songwriter, performer and producer are well documented here as is his voracious appetite for drugs and self destruction.  That he was enabled by his partners for so many years, in furtherance of even more money (in Crosby's case for drugs), is sad.Browne cohesively details the rise and fall of America's first supergroup.  It's easy to forget how influential CSN and CSN&Y were, and how by being together they pushed each other individually to be better artists, similar to The Beatles.Highly recommended.",5,0,925,0.117,1

2647,"""The Beetle"" may have outsold ""Dracula"" when it first came out, but it's easy to see after reading it why ""Dracula"" is the one best remembered.  The idea of a man turning himself into a beetle at will is too bizarre to fall into the ""it could have once happened"" category, while with ""Dracula"" every part of the world has some form of the vampire legend.The one place where ""The Beetle"" does better than ""Dracula"" is in the narration. Marsh limits his tale to three narrators whose stories overlap, where Stoker jumps back and forth between various letters and journals.  Unfortunately, the characters are poorly drawn and prone to utter nonsense intended to be either witty or clever and come across as neither.  And Marsh has no van Helsing to explain things.  The closest he has is the detective at the end, who should have entered the picture sooner since he seems to be the only one with any sense.""The Beetle"" isn't a bad book, but it's no classic either.  It reads more as a cross between an expanded ""Weird Tales"" adventure and a condensed ""Penny Dreadful"".",3,0,1065,0.115,1
2648,"According to Rana el Kaliouby, with the assistance of Carol Colman, she wrote this book in order to help as many people as possible to retain their humanity when in the cyber world. What's the problem? ""Some social scientists call it an 'empathy crisis.' It is the inability to put yourself in another's shoes and feel compassion, sympathy, kinship for another human being. This stunning lack of concern for our fellow citizens permeates and festers in the cyber world, especially on social media, and is spilling over into the real world.""Then adds, ""We, as a society, are in increasingly dangerous territory -- we are at risk of undermining the very traits that make us human in the first place."" This is what El Kaliouby means by being dehumanized.To me, it seems as unreasonable to expect technologies to have emotional intelligence as it is to expect human beings to have data processing capabilities comparable with those of a computer such as the one on which I now compose these thoughts before posting them electronically.El Kaliouby has no such expectations. ""I have learned that the greater fluency and mastery we have of our own emotions, the more confident we become in allowing ourselves to be vulnerable -- allowing ourselves to open up to others and with ourselves; this is how we become truly empathetic.""Long before Joel Robert Davitz and Michael Beldoch's (among others) conducted research on emotional intelligence (EI), later developed in much greater depth by Daniel Goleman, it was obvious that some human beings are naturally empathic or at least can become much more effective in their relationships because they can connect on an emotional level. In a word, empathy: identifying with -- being at one with -- others' feelings. Also, and of equal significance, enabling others to identify with our own feelings.Rana el Kaliouby's key insights are best revealed within the narrative, in context, but I need no spoiler alert when suggesting that her immensely personal account takes her reader into full confidence as she explains how to reclaim one's humanity by bringing emotional intelligence to collaborations and interactions with technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI); sensors and the Internet of Things (IOT); autonomous Machines -- robots, cobots, drones, and self-driving vehicles; distributed leaders and blockchains; virtual, augmented, and mixed reality; and connection of everything and everyone that include 5G networks and satellite constellations.o     o     oInvoking direct address, I urge you to read and then re-read this book because there is no other quite like it that can help you to achieve two separate but interdependent objectives: preserve and enrich your humanity, and, be guided and informed by your humanity when working in collaboration with technologies such as those just listed.Developing emotional intelligence will increase, perhaps accelerate fulfillment of your human potentialities, to be sure, but it can also ensure that breakthroughs in technology are of greatest meaning and value to the human race.",5,0,3078,0.144,1

2660,"As the bestselling author of The Reporter Who Knew Too Much as well as Denial of Justice and The Poison Patriarch, the former two books about celebrated journalist Dorothy Kilgallen and her exhaustive 18-month investigation of the JFK assassination, and the latter a well-researched biography of Joseph Kennedy, here’s a warning: James Patterson and Cynthia Fagen’s new book, the House of Kennedy is more fiction than fact, a book that distorts history across the board.In effect, Patterson, who was to be admired for his acumen as a top notch fiction writer before he saturated the market aligning with no name authors so as to water down his storytelling efforts, has this time connected with National Enquirer journalist Cynthia Fagen to hit the public with a chronicle of the Kennedy’s audaciously called “Their True Story.”The result is a no true research, no intensive investigation of the Kennedy’s, but a regurgitation of old news using the second hand accounts of others, biographers and such, many unreliable, to castigate nearly everyone in the book without any concern for the validity of what evidence they present. Point of fact: check the “Notes” at the end of the book (there is no Index) and count the very few times any interviews have actually been conducted by the authors. Also, one must certainly be careful of any book where one of the sources relied upon is a psychic!Most disappointing are the portions of the book dealing with Joe Kennedy, Marilyn Monroe and the JFK assassination. In fact, Fagen knows better since she was provided with up to date information from primary sources about Joe and the assassination by this author earlier this year. Left out, however, is any mention, among others, of Joe, “the poison patriarch,” based on a primary source account,  forcing JFK to appoint RFK attorney general, the true double cross that led to JFK’s death, and the proven fact that RFK had the strongest motive to have Marilyn eliminated since she made the mistake of threatening to bring down the Kennedy family by exposing their secrets and her love affairs with JFK and RFK, proven recently by an eyewitness whom the authors could have easily contacted.Regarding the JFK assassination, it swirls around the ludicrous “Oswald Alone” theory, debunked for five decades and counting especially, Fagen knows, due to my exposing the Jack Ruby trial transcripts in “Denial of Justice,” where eyewitness testimony proves a plot to kill the president. Regarding Ruby, the key to the assassination mystery, as Kilgallen learned, he is mentioned briefly on one page with a nonsensical quote that distorts history for sure.Instead of shedding light on the Kennedy family in a responsible and professional manner, Patterson and Fagin continue to use substandard sources during the final portions of the book. The House of Kennedy thus reads, not surprisingly, like a lengthy National Enquirer article where reporters like Fagin decide what conclusions they want to reach and fit the facts, many of them dubious or even false in nature, to those conclusions.Shame on Patterson, who should stay in the fiction world, and Fagen, who needs a refresher course in ethical journalism while taking a cue from Dorothy Kilgallen, who, unlike Fagen, was a reporter of integrity.",1,6,3283,0.096,1

2662,"Synopsis:Murder strikes close to homefor a new K-9 unit in BrooklynWhen a double homicide is strikingly familiar to a twenty-year-old cold case, Detective Nate Slater is rattled by the parallels. With a child as the only witness, he and his K-9 partner must protect little Lucy and her aunt, Willow Emery. Nate’s rough past means he always keeps an emotional distance…but in this case getting closer is the only way they’ll all survive. (Goodreads)Review:The characters are well developed and well rounded.  When Willow finds her brother and sister-in-law dead in their house and her niece playing outside, her world is turned upside down.  Her biggest concern is keeping her niece, Lucy safe.  She will have help with that from Nate, the detective who took the case, and his canine partner, Murphy.  They are members of a newly opened K-9 Unit opened in Brooklyn,  The case is very similar to a twenty year old case, and Nate is very aware of the similarities.  He will do anything to solve the case and keep Willow and Lucy safe.The writing style flows smoothly and the book is a quick easy read.  The author is very talented in her descriptive writing and these descriptions pulled me into the book from the very beginning.  There was a faith-based feel to this book and I liked the way that Willow did not lose her faith, even with everything going on.  The plot flowed well and had me turning the pages as fast as I could.I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a well crafted  Christian mystery and suspense book.

2665,"“One Fatal Flaw” is the third in the series by Anne Perry, with Daniel Pitt as our protagonist.  We are in 1910 London.The girlfriend of a not so good man has come to ask for Daniel’s help in proving her beloved innocent of murder.  There’s been arson, they know that; the warehouse is gone.  And in the warehouse fire, one man escaped and one did not.  She begs Daniel to be the defense lawyer.  But the man doesn’t seem particularly interested in having a defense.Daniel, through his friend Miriam fford Croft’s intercession, asks a famous expert in the causes of fire and fire evidence to look at the case.  This expert is rather… sure of himself. There is the hint that the expert will do anything to have his opinion sustained.  Miriam dislikes him, although she will not say why.  Of course, she won’t, because that is a source of conflict.  It will come out later, also of course. Thus, the author skirts around some facts, some little tidbits, that will leave readers wondering what’s going on.  I would have preferred to have out with it and be done with it.Ms. Perry describes the two different social worlds of Daniel Pitt and Miriam fford Croft very well.  Although they are almost but not quite social equals, it is their different sexes that divide them like a mighty chasm, and Anne Perry knows how to present this extremely well, how a historical mystery must present this, to be believable and true to its time frame and genre.  Miss fford Croft may rant and rave and fume about her constraints and pushes a bit for dramatic purposes, but she cannot do too much, and be believable.  This Ms. Perry also knows very well.  And so, Daniel and Miriam fight their own private battle to prove Rob Adwell’s innocence.The expert gets Daniel’s client off with his testimony.  Wonderful – except the book is only about half way done.  What’s up?  Ah, we are not done, not by a long shot.  Because Daniel will need the expert yet again, and not in a good way, one might say.  It is going to take all of Ms. Perry’s considerable skills to come up with a plausible plot and make this believable. Is there any doubt, gentle reader?So, Miriam goes to work again, although she can’t help officially because she is of the wrong sex, alas, so she has to work behind the scenes.  This is her book as well as Daniel’s, perhaps more so.  Another expert has to be found.  And found “she” is.  It is a little pat, but to be expected in a story like this.The author builds up the case point by point.  Modern detectives could hardly do better.  Readers may even look at “One Fatal Flaw” as a study in the beginnings of modern forensic science.  This is also a study in science versus emotions and fallibility.  Much of the last third of the book is Daniel righting wrongs and staying one step ahead of a terrible wave of anger and ego.  There is danger here, because it will force a need for revenge.  But it has to be done, because it means too much for a society predicated on the scales of justice.  You will have to read “One Fatal Flaw” to see how well he succeeds at it.I found the book eloquent as usual, if a little pedantic and heavy, being much of what it rails about is how women were treated unfairly in their intellectual and educational development, as evidenced in Miss fford Croft’s case.  In between Anne Perry talks about life, ideas, the rumblings of society with new ideas coming, how the world was changing, melting, slipping away, breaking, as she calls it.  This is more than just a historical mystery.Thanks to the publisher and to NetGalley for a copy of this book, in exchange for this review.",4,0,3612,0.099,0

The thought that a kidnapper would dress like Santa to lure a child away from his mother a few days before Christmas will probably go down as one of the scariest premises of a thriller.

Had this man and his fellow corrupt politicians succeeded, they would have undermined our democracy.  Even some Democrats noted that the ""wrongdoings"" accused of Trump did not rise to impeachable offenses, but were at worst the inappropriate utterings of a filterless loudmouth.It is not clear why Swalwell wrote this book other than perhaps to divert attention from his ridiculous, irrelevant Presidential run, or from his lackluster legislative career. House of Representatives members must run for reelection every two years, and there's nothing more attractive for a modern day Democrat than to hitch their wagon to the Impeachment Train.Nowadays, since impeachment fizzled, they're all on the BLM train, and Swalwell certainly has tried to board that car as well.The mad rush to tear down anything and anyone who expresses respect and admiration for American democracy is confined perhaps to a left wing sector of the populace but it is certainly disingenuous and deceptive enough to cause great damage to the polity.Don't waste your time, but instead read some real history and educate yourself as to the intellectual underpinnings of our democracy:  Voltaire, Descartes, Franklin, Jefferson.",1,4,1469,0.125,1

Elected without even knowing she was on the ballot, Sunshine shows up to her first day of work and as soon as the muffins arrive, the roller-coaster takes off.  No, I am not going to explain that remark.Sunshine moved into her parents guesthouse with her daughter Auri, with whom she shares a close relationship.  Auri is smarter than the average teenager, which is just fine with the adult me who appreciates her maturity.  And her wit.  For example, when mom asks, “I do look rather badass, don’t I?”, Auri responds with “All that matters is that you think you look badass.”Sunshine’s best friend is Chief Deputy Quincy Cooper. He is Sunshine’s straight man at the office.  Or is it the other way around?

2676,"If you are a woman of a “certain age,” you remember the comic strip, Cathy, which chronicled the highs and lows of women in their twenties and thirties who were trying to balance work and a personal life.  She made us, and those around us, laugh by pointing out the daily incongruities between our professional progress and our inner insecurities.  She reassured us that we were not alone, that there were other women out there confident that in their ability to deliver the big speech while fretting about the likelihood they would trip and fall on their way to the podium.In Fifty Things That Aren’t My Fault, Guieswite continues her quest to showcase the incongruities between the inner and outer worlds of those same women – now in their fifties, sixties and seventies.  Now dealing with adult children and aging parents, we are bewildered by the mystery of how to help our parents while wanting to parent adult children who neither want nor need help.  We are bewildered by our bodies’ ability to morph in all sorts of undesirable ways and our minds’ refusal to accept that we will never again look “up and coming.”  We wonder how to remain relevant, wonder if it is possible, and suspect that no one cares.  Yet, Cathy captures the humor and absurdity of it all.  I laughed out loud several times.  I shed a tear more than once.This is not a book about feminism; it is a book about feminists of an earlier era who struggled with change and what it meant in their lives. It is a book about the women who were caught in the middle; they naively believed they could do and have it all. It may not speak to millennials, and I wonder if that matters.  This book is not quite as funny as the comic strip, but it is far more poignant. The landscape of aging is unquestionably harsh; loss and letting go are prominent features.  Cathy’s talent allows us to laugh at ourselves while recognizing the essence of who we are and were – to take joy in those we love, including ourselves.  Thank you, Cathy Guisewite, for a gift I did not know how much I wanted.",5,0,2053,0.134,1

2687,"This third book in the Daniel Pitt series is another winner.  Ms. Perry has branched out from her two long-running series by starting this new one with Charlotte and Thomas Pitt's son Daniel who is a young lawyer (25) who has recently graduated from Cambridge University, and is working at a prestigious law firm in London.  This series still has Ms. Perry's flawless plotting and detailed characterizations.  It is also an illuminating insight into the times (late 1910 and early 1911).  England is going through some major societal and political changes, and there are murmurings of some real unrest in Germany.  Daniel has brought his firm into what seems a hopeless case where a young man has been charged with arson and murder.  The young man's girlfriend has enlisted his help.  Daniel pulls out all the stops to save his client, but while doing so, makes some very worrisome and powerful enemies which puts himself, his family, his firm and his friends in grave danger.  Daniel struggles to do what's right and just at any cost.  He is not a young man that will give up on anything once he's on a case.  (A bit like his mother Charlotte).  And we get to see Charlotte and Thomas Pitt again in this spin-off series.  This is a page-turner, and the book has a particularly evil and powerful villain, who, like all Anne Perry's characters, is very clearly and realistically portrayed,  This is a great new series from a very prolific and much revered author.",5,0,1462,0.138,0
2688,"3.5 stars, rounded upThis is my first book by Jennifer Hillier, but I’ve been anxious to read something of hers for a while.  This is an extremely fast, easy read.  I blew through it.  It starts with a mother losing her four year old son in Pike Place Market.  She soon learns he’s been kidnapped.  Sixteen months later, and he’s still gone.  Then she discovers her husband is having an affair.  At this point, she makes an irrevocable decision.The story alternates between Marin, the wife and mother, and Kenzie, the other woman.  I can’t say either woman is likeable,  but Hillier does a great job of fleshing them both out.  I had sussed out the villain early on in the book but certainly not the how it all played out.I enjoyed how once again social media plays into the lives of the young.  Hillier even does a great job explaining the why of its importance.This is a fun read, but it’s like a Chinese meal.

2689,"This one anecdote that Christian Brose provides is highly effective: “0ver the past decade, in U.S. war games against China, the United States has a nearly perfect record: We have lost almost every single time.”The Problem:China has dutifully been studying the US military.  From 1990-2017 their military spending has increased 900% and has increased 400% since 2006.  Significant investments have been in made in surveillance, AI, and robots. National champions have been subsidized and protected to insure their technology helps the country.  Foreign companies are exposed to hacking and R&D theft, a phenomenon that is estimated to cost $250 billion dollars every year.  Knowing that the bulk of US Defense spending has been placed on bulky conventional weapons, they have devised a plan of ""Systems Destruction Warfare"": a mix of missiles to neutralize Asian bases, jammers to confuse air support, anti-ship ballistic missiles, long range radar and satellite, anti-satellite missiles, aggressive submarine and marine invasion forces and nuclear weapons.  Additionally, China has extended its reach in the South China Sea by making man made islands.Additionally, Russia has followed the Garasamov Doctrine: using other methods outside of war such as cyber-espianoge, media interference, etc. While Russia was ill equipped to fight against Georgia, it too studied the US and worked on communication disabling weapons, smart bombs, and geolocation devices. This investment paid off quickly as the “Little Green Men” in Crimea were able to overwhelm Ukraine's forces.How did the US get here:Meanwhile, the US has been hamstrung by partisanship, bureaucracy, and a focus on the wrong priorities.  President Obama cut military spending yet had ambitious military plans in Afghanistan and Libya.  President Trump has diverted military funds to his border wall, has not filled senior DoD positions and is concerned about lesser priorities like Venezuela and Iran.  The bureaucracy often fails to see the need for new weapons because they are different than the existing weapons they understand.  When a new project is green lighted, the acquisition process can be laughably long-winded and costly.  Further stasis is encouraged by the politics of building weapons in Congressional districts.  While new technologies would often be preferable, it is unpopular to shift manufacturing away from locations that have them.  To quote Brose, ""Its like we defeated the USSR and then adopted its procurement process.""The Future of War:The author sees the future of warfare involving AI to crunch large amounts of gleaned data, satellites, additive manufacturing, brain computer interface, and quantum sensors. However, the sad truth is that while the private sector is providing some of these new technologies to consumers already, the military is not.  Members of our armed services use closed systems built by parochial defense contractors and then then go home to a world of advanced search algorithms and video games using the latest silicon chips.  These private, consumer-led companies pay their employees better and attract the best young best young innovators.  Often times they are loath to work on government projects for moral or financial reasons.  The traditional defense contractors have consolidated and have no where near the resources of Big Tech. The Top 5 tech firms spend $70.5 billion per year on R&D where as the top defense firms spend  $6.2 billion. Apple alone could buy the entire defense sector with cash currently on its balance sheet. He sums up by saying, its ""the exact opposite of the military industrial complex: those that can help won’t. Those that want to, can’t.""  Only Palantir and SpaceX have significantly helped the government and it has taken two billionaire founders with a contrarian streak.What Should the US do:The positive news is that the US has a template for military innovation that has worked.  President Eisenhower entrusted programs champions that had the vision and drive to see the project done.  He would protect them from the bureaucracy and insure they had cash.  At times, horse trading and giving members of Congress incentives (""pork"") can help.  We should ask more of our allies to help but not discard them.  We could incentivize Silicon Valley by providing more certainty on future returns on their investment. Various projects could also compete for their worthiness instead of Congress apportioning funds for a specific program. He is quick to highlight successes such as the Valkyrie and Orca projects and some improvement in controlling drones via brain computer interface but much more is needed.This is an important read.  I cannot assert how far behind the US has become but I think Brose's narrative is broadly correct.  Washington seems to be in a state of dysfunction.  The government seems to have lost its focus given the complacency bred by the ending of the Cold War.  Is this just the cyclical nature of the ever evolving world of defense?  Perhaps.  It would have been helpful if the author showed the government processes that have led to China and Russia's rapid development of new technology.  Are they beholden to the same special interests and myopia we have been?  But these are minor points.  Well worth the read.",5,0,5288,0.118,0

Now she’s been whisked away to the continent with her Aunt whom she knows does not like her in the least, who continually berates her bemoaning the fact that Arabella will never be able to attract a well-connected husband.Believe it or not, Arabella, a blue-stocking at heart, would rather have her nose stuck in a medical text then even consider being wed! However, Arabella is forced to accompany her family on the Grand Tour in Switzerland.  Rather than follow along Arabella is most anxious to see the dungeons in a castle where she unexpectedly runs into the the most handsomest man she has ever laid eyes on, the rakehell-in-exile, Gabriel, the Earl of Langdale. Knowing what the gossips had told of the man, Arabella realized the only thing worse than getting married to  a man like him would be to fall in love with him where his philandering ways would only break her heart.Nicknamed the Errant-Earl, Gabriel Holmes-Fitzgerald is no stranger to scandal, but when caught in flagrante with the young beauty Arabella Jardine, he’s obliged to offer her his hand.  He promised he would do the right thing by her, but he was honest enough to tell her he’s never been in love and probably would never love her.Now this was not a great beginning precisely because Arabella knew she was partially if not fully in love with him.  So a deal was struck. Until Gabriel could completely prove to his vile cousin that he was the true heir to the Earldom, he and Arabella would not have relations until no doubt remained.  Until then, they would remain in separate bedchambers.This was a very charming story and the dialogs, and the sensual innuendoes were highly entertaining.

But Dark Horse is the best of this new bunch.  There are other books out there that offer empowering advice based on harnessing your individually, but Todd Rose is the only author who draws upon twenty-first century science, math and research.  He shares just enough science to make it clear he knows what he is talking about but it is not boring or dry and he stays focused on how to use this knowledge to actually live a better life.  I liked the table inside the book that compares the dark horse mindset to the traditional self-help/success mindset and how I know when I have reached it.

Fair warning, and by the author's own acknowledgement, there's not much ""new"" here, as these principles have been addressed by many other writers over the decades.  That said, they are nonetheless given a ""thoughtful"" refresh when presented in the context of Mr. Crenshaw's military experiences and carefully, engagingly written prose.Am taking off one star as some of the SEAL experiences are indulgently over-detailed and certain passages become redundant, but that doesn't render this book any less worthwhile for reminding us, with a very well-crafted logic, what we can do to make the most of our lives as individuals and American citizens.",4,0,928,0.128,1

It's the story of sisters Elise and Lorena and Gus McQueen who, at the start of the novel, is their teacher and is set in early 1900s Oklahoma.  Great potential, right?  Well, the first chapter had me completely confused.  Elise's habit of repeating things from the newspaper and the general up and down tone comes across as jerky.  Things settle a bit when it moves to chapters featuring Lorena and Gus but there's a lot of repetition as the characters recount events from their own perspectives (although Gus more than once talks about the sheep he saw in the river back in North Carolina.). I so wanted to like this but I couldn't settle into the story partly because things went wonky for me every time Elise appeared.  Thanks to Edelweiss for the ARC.

It only illustrates three simple stitches the running stitch, back stitch and cross stitch.  The first two stitches are illustrated using the simplest technique of a straight line. If you find a pattern in the book with only straight lines, let me know.  It does not explain how to map out the running stitch (the original blackwork) nor how to make the pattern reversible on the back side.  Most of the patterns are complicated and I presume use the back stitch which is not nearly as neat.  I also presume the patterns are not intended to be reversible and so no discussion references this technique.  There are no charts which illustrate to a beginner how to stitch along the pattern making the back side as neat and tidy as possible.  While I love the book for its authenic flavor in patterns, I am very disappointed in the lack of any explanation how to work truly reversible blackwork using the running stitch.",3,4,1046,0.098,1

He is barely holding on by a thread and can’t even see it.  While this book does revolve around him trying to find the mysterious girl on the bridge, it is all about Mitchell and him discovering that he is so deeply still grieving his partner.  Everything that he has done up until now may not have been healing him and his daughter like he thought it was.  Poppy his daughter was a sort of light in the darkness in the book.  I do have to say the only thing I didn’t like is she is to be 9 years old and I know kids mentally grow in different stages, her grammar and mannerisms were more of a 11 year old.  That being said everything else about his daughter was absolutely delightful.  Mitchell does evolve throughout the book and takes us on quite an emotional ride with him.  Everyone he meets or interacts with seems to have a story to tell or something to teach him.I don’t want to say to much more about to many characters, but the front desk man Carl was a delight. I could have a whole book on him and be fine with it.  This whole book just flowed for me, if I wouldn’t have had work and kids I probably would’ve just sat and read the whole thing.

And it’s going to be great for business.""That this could  also be a one-liner for the current pandemic?  Is NOT irrelevant.This book, and the preceding two, is about change.  Sweeping, unexpected change - and how people deal with it.That society is currently dealing with sweeping, unexpected change is coincidental.  Mostly.John Scalzi is very good at honing in at universal truths.  Here, those truths are: people really don't like change...yet change is endemic to the human condition.Mostly, change happens in digestible increments which make people grumble, but which they can tolerate.But sometimes change happens faster.  That can make people cling to something, making it crumble even faster under their shattering grip.  Change makes doing what's right hard.Timing has made this last installment of the Trilogy painfully pertinent.It seems to me - and I admit, I'm frequently wrong - people may be tempted to give this book a lukewarm review if it makes them uncomfortable.  So, I'm posting my five star review to say me being uncomfortable?  Means I believe Mr. Scalzi did a very good job.I'm not a very good writer, and maybe this is a weak review.But if you read this before posting your own review?

Carefully defining his terminology, he provides many examples for the topics of each chapter so that readers with a background in science, philosophy, or the social sciences can follow and understand his conclusions and recommendations.  With the proliferation of pseudoscience and what amounts to anti-science found in many areas of popular culture, his book is important not only for professional scientists, it is also an essential read for lay people who are interested in science and what sets science apart from what attempts to be passed of as science, that is, the scientific attitude.  Although it had been some 40 odd years since I had a Philosophy of Science class, I found  McIntyre’s book to flow in an exciting and entertaining manner while maintaining a professional presentation. For the lay reader, there are many references to dig deeper, to reference previous chapters, to anticipate upcoming chapters.

2749,"Sometimes you have such a great experience with an author that they are up on a sort of pedestal.  When you later read a book by said author that doesn’t live up to your expectations it’s hard to decide if your expectations were just set too high or if there is something lacking in the story. That’s what happened with this book for me.  I’ve read two other of stories by this author that I absolutely adore.  It’s been almost two years since I read Leave No Trace and I still think of it often.  It’s a story that really stuck with me. So is it this book or my perception of the book that is at fault?One thing I can say for certain, this story is a unique. In fact, that’s something common among the books of Mindy Mejia that I’ve read; they are all stories that are fresh and different than the other stories I’ve read.  I really appreciate that fact and know it takes a lot of research and time for authors to put so much information into their stories.At first I thought I’d like Nora, the main character.  As the story progressed I had a hard time having any sympathy for her.  It’s not that she does anything terrible or unforgivable, she’s just not very likable.  And that may well be by design.  It’s not always bad when the protagonist is unlikable, but most of the other characters quickly become unsympathetic as well.  And that did become a problem for me. I had nobody to latch onto, to root for, to invest my time and energy in as I progressed through this book.Even with this disconnect from the characters, I still found myself with some investment in the story.  Like I said earlier, it’s a unique tale.  There were things I though I knew and didn’t, things I thought I knew and did, and things I didn’t think of at all.  Those are all good things when it comes to a mystery book.If nothing else, this story made me want to visit Minneapolis.  This author truly has a knack for describing her settings.  I never thought a book would give me the urge to visit big Midwestern city when I already live in a big Midwestern city.  But here we are, with me wondering when/if I can visit Minneapolis soon.To sum up, I found this story to be okay, but I could be judging it too harshly due to my previous experiences with this author.  I will definitely never pass up an opportunity to read another of her stories.**I received an ARC of this book courtesy of Net Galley and the publisher.

2761,"I enjoy Darynda Jones' characters very much, and while these people aren't as funny as the Graves series and Charlie Whatsits, I found them endearing and fun.I especially liked that ABDFS didn't feature the abrupt, absurd, story-killing swerves into extreme woo-woo supernatural that the Charlie series devolved into.  There are hints of some enhanced or alternate reality, but subtle and in scale with the story. Maybe it will build into some fun paranormal features in future installments, but it seems like DJ  is creating a base that can handle it.  I loved big chunks of the Charlies, until they got so blah-blah-blah with the inter-dimensional god goofiness there was no story left.  If you had the same mixed response to the Graves series, and you can forgive some pretty obvious plot giveaways (honestly, nobody is going to be surprised at the mystery of Auri's parentage), and you don't expect a strict adherence to police procedure in a fun romance, you should definitely try this one!",4,0,995,0.226,1
2762,"Human KIND is a heartfelt, uplifting account of taking life’s lemons and making some refreshing, iced lemonade.  Brad describes his struggle to maintain some sort of balance and state of normalcy as he and his family members suddenly become brave soldiers in the battle against Mia’s diagnosis with leukemia.  Instead of being beaten down by this disease’s brutality, he notes how the kind gestures and deeds of other people positively impacted their family’s spirit. These actions offered the strength they needed to march onward toward recovery and renewed spirit.  Paying it forward, Brad constructs an organized, easy to follow, and powerful guide of sorts, that includes inspiring stories of how an act of kindness can make a world of an impact.  This book serves as a resource of acts of kindness and even includes well thought out methods and conversations that may take the awkwardness and tentativeness out of the equation so that we can follow our hearts and embark on the journey of kindness!",5,0,1003,0.222,0

Addie has a lot going on in her personal life in this book, romantic entanglements, long lost relatives, friends and neighbors.  I thought at the beginning of the book that really was confusing and disorienting but as she always does the author spun one heck of a mystery!The mysteries in this series are always interesting and Addie's ability to notice things, ask questions outside the box and push forward relentlessly are what make her such an interesting character.  The fact that she had to do them while dealing with some seriously emotional tangles makes this a very good read. Bravo Addie!",4,0,920,0.17,0

2772,"Jax and Gretchen have been together for seventeen years but the last four were not good or happy.  Jax moved out and the end of the marriage is near.  When Gretchen has an accident and is critically injured with brain trauma, Jax is called to the hospital.  Gretchen suffers amnesia and suddenly, things aren’t clear for either one of these women.I started out loving this book so much!  It was sweet and sad, hopeful and full of possibilities.  I loved how conflicted and torn up Jax was when Gretchen was unconscious in the hospital.  She has so much to deal with, a job she hates, a hyper son, a girlfriend and an impending divorce yet she still has feelings for her wife.  Gretchen is lost in her amnesia but so convinced she loves Jax, even when she finds out their marriage was almost over.  Jax had been so hurt but you could see an underlying love there even though she had kind of moved on.  My heart broke for both of these women and all I wanted was for them to make things right and forgive the other so they could get to the cuddles and sexy bits. The majority of the first half was taken from Gretchen’s POV, but at about the half way mark, the book started to confuse me. This part was told mostly from Jax’s POV but the details don’t match up with Gretchen’s.  It’s a plot twist based on Gretchen’s accident but I got lost somewhere along the way and it stopped making sense to me.  Eventually, even though I was clueless as to what happened, their stories connect again.

2779,"In an era where a man like Julian Assange can be mercilessly persecuted for just doing honest journalism, it takes a great deal of courage to expose the lies and misdeeds of America’s imperial misadventures. Yet they must be exposed and condemned for exactly what they have been and continue to be. “No More War” is a book that goes the extra mile in doing just that.As with all of his excellent books, Dan Kovalik has packed this readable and well-researched work with an abundance of invaluable information and insight into the imperial war machine, the imperial diplomatic and PR juggernaut, and the extensive predatory machinations reducing the rest of the world to rubble so that American corporations and its ravenous banking system can subjugate and exploit their populations and extract their material wealth.We citizens, under the spell of the Western propaganda machine, slog through the malaise of censored news, disinformation and deceptions with our eyes wide shut, preferring to avoid at all costs acknowledging the nefarious role our “exceptional” nation plays in perpetrating some of the most sordid war crimes in history, thereby propagating unfathomable misery across the planet.Though we might prefer to immerse ourselves in the bliss of this willful ignorance, as the folks who fund such misadventures with our tax dollars, and who implicitly support it by raising no serious objections, much less mounting actual resistance, we are ourselves responsible. We are culpable. We share the guilt of those actively engineering and promoting this tsunami of death and destruction, a reign of terror inflicted on any nation who would dare stand in our path of full-spectrum dominance and self-serving plunder.How is it “we the people” are rendered so indifferent to these acts of aggression?Not an excuse, but an incriminating explanation, provides the required insight:  We are told — and gullibly believe — that somehow this orgy of violence, the bloodbaths and rubble which result from our military interventions, are in pursuit of a better world, one where democracy and freedom and justice for all reigns supreme. That it is the U.S.’s responsibility to stand up for and protect the citizens of other nations who are being deprived of the rights and privileges due to all of us as humans.But as Professor Daniel Kovalik, author of this excellent book proves beyond any doubt, for seven decades, our wars of aggression and fostering regime change around the globe have had nothing to do with the tragically laughable “cover story” that the U.S. is spreading democracy and protecting human rights, but rather are the direct, predictable, and inevitable product of America’s obsessive fixation on world conquest and unchallengeable global domination.No More War covers a lot of ground, looking in detail at Congo, Rwanda, Uganda, Afghanistan, Syria, Libya, Bolivia, Venezuela, Cuba, Nicaragua, the NATO aggression against former Yugoslavia, the Vietnam War.  We see 1) how disruptive and counterproductive U.S. meddling in such countries is, 2) how such interference in the affairs of sovereign nations contravenes both currently accepted norms and international law, 3) how this abuse of military prowess is rapidly overextending U.S. projection of power, 4) how it is making America a pariah in the world community, and 5) how this will ultimately result in a major confrontation with countries like Russia and China, two nuclear-armed nations which genuinely have assumed the higher moral ground in the world of geopolitics. Dan Kovalik also eloquently exposes the profound hypocrisy of the U.S. claiming to be standing up for human and political rights in other countries, as it ignores and violates within its own borders many of those same rights for its own citizens.“No More War” is a powerful, informative book. While the well-crafted prose reads comfortably, conferring it with NYT best seller potential, its erudition demands that it be taken seriously. This invaluable volume begs to be used as a textbook for university peace study courses. For we can’t very well chart the right course without fully understanding where we’ve gone wrong . . . so very very wrong.",5,0,4191,0.109,1

2786,"I was disappointed.  I probably should have read reviews before buying.  The book is so tediously ideological that I could barely finish.  There is very little new or useful here, particularly in the first part of the book which unconvincingly tries to construct an unbroken line between Lewis & Clark and 1800s “imperialism” and Ferguson in 2014.  What  seems to be different is that the terms “racial capitalism” or “imperial racial capitalism” or “white supremacy” or “white man’s country” is placed promiscuously on every page or so just so we don’t forget Johnson’s monochrome, simplistic interpretation of American history - whites invariably bad, blacks and Indians invariably good.  This is less history than it is dogma. No deviation from orthodoxy is allowed to surface. It is relentlessly “whites bad” throughout. Indians and blacks are either invariably virtuous or innocent victims.  Moral judgment is reserved only for whites, who, by the way, are monolithic and uniform and defined pretty much only by their shared melanin deficiency.  Never once, for instance, does Johnson mention let alone explore the culture of the Indians - often warlike, often cruel, marauding, slave-taking-and-owning - that was removed,  inevitably although  unjustly by modern standards, by European-Americans.  This is less an attempt at history as it is propaganda that ignores  most of the complexity of the actual flesh and blood lives  who - good, bad and ugly - actually lived the events.",1,2,1486,0.077,1
2787,"Jill Caugherty’s latest novel, Waltz in Swing Time, is a satisfying slice of historical-fiction that delivers a pair of gripping narratives set some seventy-five years apart.Bouncing between a present-day nursing home and 1930’s Utah, Caugherty’s novel ultimately explores the Great Depression through the young eyes of the intrepid Irene Stallings as she grapples with love and heartache amid a backdrop of one of America’s darkest periods.Reading almost like a biography, Caugherty's heartfelt narrative simmers from the first page to the last. From Irene’s unwavering musical aspirations (and the discord it inspires with her mother) to her decision to leave home and venture out on her own (eventually landing in Zion National Park), Waltz in Swing Time manages to populate its two vividly-constructed timelines with an endearingly colorful cast of characters.While much of the story revels in a brooding tension created by seemingly insurmountable hardships, Caugherty’s novel ultimately provides a genuinely touching ending, one that resonates on multiple levels.

In “Your Story Matters,” Leslie dangles some delicious, fresh, enticing “carrots” to lead readers through some very meaningful writing practices.  She does this by skillfully weaving an interesting mix of stories from her life, stories from students in her workshops, and stories from the Bible, into some very simple, practical, step-by-step instructions.  You sit down to read the book, and practically “voilà,” there you are able to write some of your most meaningful stories.Leslie says that writing our stories is all about “remembering.”  She writes, “Remembering is a crucial activity for all of us.  We will not know who we are without remembering.”  She also assures readers that “Covering the entire scope of a life is not possible” (whew!) but that there is real value in remembering and sharing certain significance stories with others.I wish Leslie had written this book about a decade ago.  I would have given copies to my parents.  My mom passed away before she could write her stories.  I have just a few of her written memories and would have so loved more.  My Dad did write his “autobiography.” for us, finishing it at 89 years of age after working on it for years.  It’s pages and pages of facts and details but little story.

2799,"This was an enjoyable book.  It is actually the third book featuring young lawyer Daniel Pitt and aspiring scientist, Miriam fford Croft (who is also the daughter of Marcus fford Croft, Daniel's employer).  I think reading the first two books would be beneficial, as it would provide more insight into the main characters, but the book can be enjoyed without having read the earlier books (I have not read them).  Daniel Pitt is approached by a young woman, Jessie Beale, who wants him to defend her boyfriend, who has been accused of arson and murder for a warehouse fire in which a rival gang member (Paddy Jackson) died.  He agrees to take the case, which will actually be argued by a more senior associate in the firm, Toby Kitteridge, with Daniel sitting second chair.  The case against the accused, Rob Adwell, seems like a lost cause, but Daniel consults with Miriam, who suggests seeking the assistance of Sir Barnabas Saltram; Miriam despises Sir Barnabas, but he is the foremost expert in England on fire damage to skulls.  Sir Barnabas agrees to testify and his testimony exonerates Mr. Adwell.  A few weeks later Mr. Adwell dies in a warehouse fire in the exact same circumstances as Paddy Jackson.  This time Jessie Beale is arrested for his murder and she seeks out Daniel and Toby to represent her.  They have no choice but to agree and they have no choice but to seek testimony from Sir Barnabas again, which will exonerate Jessie (even though she has all but admitted to Daniel and Toby that she was guilty).  While trying to put on a proper defense, Daniel, with the help of Miriam and a fellow forensic scientist, try to find a way to show Sir Barnabas is wrong and expose Jessie's guilt without revealing they are working at cross-purposes.  They ultimately enlist the help of a forensic expert from Holland, who is called by the prosecution, and who is able to demonstrate that Sir Barnabas' testimony is faulty.Shortly after their ""loss"", Mr. Pitt is approached by Adria Leigh, the widow of James Leigh, who was convicted of arson and murder in the death of Marguerite Daventry twenty years ago.  Mrs. Daventry's husband, Roger, had been originally charged with her murder, but Barnabas' testimony about fire damage to skulls resulted in Roger being found not guilty. James Leigh was later arrested and charged with arson and murder and after being convicted, was put to death by hanging.  The trial made Barnabas Saltram famous and also advanced the political aspirations of Roger Daventry.  With Sir Barnabas shown not to be infallible, Mrs. Leigh hopes that her husband's case can be re-opened and he can be posthumously exonerated, as his conviction has made life very difficult for her and her son -- no-one wants to associate with them because of what her husband allegedly had done.At the most basic level, it would seem that the firm has to take the case and correct this injustice.  However, Sir Barnabas has testified in numerous cases over the past twenty years, all of which are potentially called into question by the Jessie Beale case.  There are many people, including in the government and in the legal system, that are not interested in the Daventry case being reopened or possibly dozens or hundreds of other verdicts questioned.  One of the best aspects of the book is that the author fully explores the competing tensions between seeking justice for the Leighs and the possibility of having to re-open and re-try dozens, if not hundreds, of cases, thereby casting doubt on the legitimacy of the legal system and court verdicts, as well as publicly acknowledging that an innocent man was convicted and executed (and possibly others as well in other cases).My only real complaint with the book is the ending. Sir Barnabas Saltram is exposed as petty and vindictive and the testimony about fire damage to skulls that made him famous 20 years ago and that he has been repeating ever since has been shown to be faulty, which results in Daniel obtaining vindication for the widow of James Leigh, who was convicted of arson and murder in the case of Marguerite Daventry and was hanged as a result. After Sir Barnabas leaves the witness stand, Miriam and her father start celebrating; Miriam thanks Daniel for defending her reputation; and then Antonia Llewellyn, the sister of Marguerite, offers congratulations and offers Mrs. Leigh and her son a place to live, jobs, and further education for her son if he wants it.  This is a wonderful ending.  However, no judge is going to allow this celebrating and conversation in the courtroom when the trial has not officially concluded.  It would have been better for the trial to have formally ended before the celebration and offers of assistance took place.I received a copy of the e-book via NetGalley in exchange for a review.",4,0,4810,0.106,1
2800,"I confess, the book cover was the first thing that got my attention and, immediately following, the realization that it incorporated a wealth of NYC history (oh, my beloved NYC).  I had little knowledge of nightclubs, specifically all that went into Gatien's empire in terms of creativity, building his ""family"" , his sense of generosity and insight.  This was engaging, thought-provoking, and the writing was superb!",5,0,417,0.255,0
2801,"The intentions in this historical fiction graphic are impressive.The illustrations are not as exciting as I wold have liked, but it almost seemed on purpose...whether it was or not...don't tell me.Despite this taking place in Korea, the content is highly relevant to North America right now.Give it a whirl and get down with some Korean revolutionaries.Thanks to NetGalley & Letter Better Publishing Services for my DRC.",4,0,420,0.085,0
2802,"No joke, Pamela's new book and her IGTV quarantine cooking videos saved my sanity during quarantine.  My favorite part is Pamela's substitution suggestions, which is essential for a novice cook like me, and especially helpful during quarantine when many marketing items weren't  available.  Also super helpful because my house has one meat eater and one vegetarian.  Hope one day I can take Pamela's cooking classes.",5,0,416,0.248,0
2803,This has become my favorite book in recent memory.  The stories of the authors upbringing and her experience as a mother were fascinating.  Her research into attachment theory was incredibly thorough and she really brought Mary Ainsworth to life.  The most pleasant surprise for me was Bethany’s mother.  She was a surprising but welcome hero.  I really enjoyed the entire book and recommend it highly.,5,0,402,0.353,1
2804,"This book is phenomenal!  It is so brilliantly written!  I've watched Maurice all the way back to All My Children days and he's always been a favorite so it was just a given I'd order the book.  It was so much more than I expected...he opened up and told the good, bad, and the ugly.  He pours his heart out and shares intimate details of living with mental illness and gives insight into every aspect of his life.  It's a must read not just for soap fans but for everyone.",5,0,473,0.097,0
2805,"The characters are wonderful and the story really drew me in.  What a joy to go along on the journey with Missy to her new life with friends and family from her previous loneliness.  I had an inkling of a few of the things revealed at the end but they were still a surprise.  Because of some parallels to my own life right now, there were a few things that definitely had me reaching for the Kleenix.Overall, just an excellent book.  This would be great for book clubs and discussions.",5,0,485,0.25,0
2806,"This is the second book I have by this company and I love both.  This one is beautiful and has floral themed papers, stickers, wrapping paper, envelopes and note cards, postcards, etc.  The paper in here is just beautiful and useful for many purposes.  My daughter and I have already used several of the stationery items from here to send notes to family and friends.  The paper quality is really nice and there are some thicker cardboard images that you can pull out and frame.  Love this book of paper.",5,0,504,0.24,1
2807,"I ""met"" Leslie Blodgett years ago and grew to love her Bare Mineral products and I became one if her Angels.  She felt like a friend I had never met IRL.  Her personal notes and inspiration are now in her new book.  I learned more about Leslie's background interspersed with ""Pretty Good Advice"".  Those little bits are what makes her a success.  Her bits of wisdom in this quick enjoyable book are worth the read.  She will make you smile and make you a believer in her ""Pretty Good Advice"".",5,0,492,0.363,0
2808,"I was attracted to this book, long before it was published, as I have an alkaline water machine, so knew that had to be healthy.  Ross is passionate about this program and very knowledgeable on this subject, having coached students for many years.  I am convinced this is the way for me to get my digestive issues under control, and it can help with many other health issues as well - things that wouldn't even cross your mind.  This is a easy program to do, and the healthiest you'll ever eat!",5,0,494,0.199,1
